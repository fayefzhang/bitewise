       "   'content': 'President Donald Trump utilized his first day back in office to put a handful of executive orders in motion, one of which was announcing the United States’ withdrawal from the WHO, the World Health Organization.\\n\\nThis wasn’t exactly a surprising move, considering Trump’s history with the organization. He attempted to remove the U.S. from the WHO in 2020 before Joe Biden overturned the decision and resumed funding for the organization. One of Trump’s major running points during his campaign was keeping American dollars in-house and not paying for what he perceived to be a waste of funds, which always meant the WHO was in jeopardy.\\n\\nVideos by VICE\\n\\nTrump cited the organization’s “mishandling” of the COVID-19 pandemic as the main reason for the decision.\\n\\nDonald Trump Pulls The United States Out of the WHO\\n\\nAbove all else, it’s the money the country has invested in the WHO that ultimately fueled the decision. America has been the WHO’s largest donor since its inception in 1948. The country has routinely given around $163 million in yearly contributions, with that number going as high as over $800 million at times. There are up to 194 countries involved in the WHO, with America providing up to a fifth of the organization’s funding, per USA Today.\\n\\n“Everybody rips off the United States and that’s it—it’s not going to happen anymore,” Trump said on Monday during a press conference.\\n\\nWithout the United States providing funding, the WHO will now likely lean on China, which has typically been the next largest provider. The order signed by Trump on Monday specifically mentions the population size of China and the fact that, despite it being far larger than The States’, the country pays less than 90% of what America does to the WHO.\\n\\nJapan, Germany, and the United Kingdom have rounded out the top five contributing countries over the years.\\n\\nThe World Health Organization has yet to comment on Monday’s order.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Shortly after his inauguration, President Donald Trump took a set of thick, black permanent markers and signed a sweeping set of executive orders that took aim at everything from immigration and gender to TikTok and climate change. One of his first moves was to withdraw the US from the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations’ global health agency responsible for safeguarding and promoting health around the world since 1948.\\n\\nThe US is one of the WHO’s biggest funders, so any shortage of financial and political support will likely have major ramifications for global health efforts like eliminating malaria, improving access to high-quality health care, and reducing maternal mortality. While that may not directly matter to rich countries like the US that have the means to address their own health challenges, one of the WHO’s most important jobs is to help coordinate the international response to pandemics and outbreaks — events that can threaten everyone, regardless of borders, as we learned during Covid-19.\\n\\nTo Trump and his supporters, the WHO’s perceived failure on that job is one of the biggest reasons why the US should withdraw. Chief among Trump’s complaints are the WHO’s mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic and other global health crises, its failure to reform, and its inability to demonstrate independence from powerful but authoritarian WHO member states, namely China.\\n\\nTrump’s decision has engendered plenty of criticism, including from experts who argue that the US could suffer if it loses access to vital WHO data on outbreaks. Still, the WHO is far from perfect, and even before Trump, scientists, think tanks, and government bodies have been pointing out the WHO’s myriad problems, from the lack of term limits for senior leadership to its massive budget for headquarters staff who are paid additional stipends (around $5,000 to $7,000 per month) to cover the cost of living in Geneva, one of the world’s most expensive cities.\\n\\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\\n\\nI’ve seen the inefficiencies and mismanagement first hand: In my almost 10-year career as a global health epidemiologist, I have interacted with the WHO on many occasions, including, at times, coordinating with them to respond to disease outbreaks in Africa. Like Trump, my biggest complaint is that the organization has shown it is loath to reflect on and address its deficiencies — deficiencies that matter hugely when it has been given the monumental responsibility of safeguarding the world’s health. There has always been some intangible and unspoken sense that the WHO cannot be wrong and cannot be questioned, even after it was clear that it bungled certain aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic.\\n\\nBut while the WHO is far from perfect, many of its flaws are symptoms of more fundamental challenges that go beyond how it is governed. Balancing the need to respond to international health threats while respecting national sovereignty means cooperation is a fine line — and it’s one that’s becoming harder for the agency to walk.\\n\\nFor the WHO to survive, it needs to improve. And for the US to have the best chances of protecting itself from future global health emergencies — especially as the Trump administration also works to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development, another key player in global health and development — it still needs the WHO. But it needs a better one.\\n\\nWhat Trump gets right — and wrong — about WHO\\n\\nIn his executive order, Trump reiterated many of the same issues he raised five years ago when he first threatened to withdraw from the WHO.\\n\\nOne of Trump’s biggest complaints was that the agency was too slow to alert the world of an emerging health threat in China and to move to contain its spread. Local newspapers had been reporting that a mysterious illness was spreading around Wuhan as early as November 17, 2019, a fact backed up by genetic analysis.\\n\\nBut Chinese health authorities didn’t alert the WHO — which the country was required to do under a legal framework called the International Health Regulations — to a spate of patients with an unknown pneumonia-like disease until December 31. By then, valuable time to contain the disease had been lost, though it is Beijing, not WHO, that is largely at fault for this lag.\\n\\nStill, while the WHO has limited if any power to compel China or any other country to act, the body should have been more proactive in November and December.\\n\\n“WHO has country offices, WHO has relationships with Ministries of Health. I would argue they certainly should have been aware this was happening,” said Ashish Jha, the dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health and the White House Covid-19 response coordinator during the Biden administration. “It was showing up in a lot of media, social media, and they should have pushed the government to say, what is this? What is going on here, and why don’t we know more about it?”\\n\\nWithin five days of learning about the unusual cases in China, the WHO had alerted its member states. But the WHO’s Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus traveled to China and, instead of confronting the government about its obfuscation, heralded Beijing’s response to the outbreak. And then the WHO consistently parrotted inaccurate information from the Chinese government — namely that the virus was not spreading from person to person — to the rest of the world for weeks.\\n\\nWhile the WHO proclaimed Covid-19 a public health emergency in late January, the messaging from the highest levels of WHO in those early months, when officials believed it was still possible that Covid could be contained, was too often confusing.\\n\\n“For the moment, we are not witnessing sustained and intensive community transmission of this virus, and we are not witnessing large-scale severe disease or death,” Ghebreyesus said during a briefing in late February. That was simply untrue. By that time, China had reported almost 80,000 cases and nearly 3,000 deaths from Covid-19, while 37 other countries were also reporting cases and deaths.\\n\\nIt also took the WHO two years, until late 2021, to finally acknowledge that Covid-19 was airborne, despite the mountain of evidence that scientists had amassed just six months after the first cases. A WHO spokesperson pushed back against this. “From January 2020, WHO said transmission was occurring between people when they breathe, talk (later sing) and especially in settings like hospitals, households and long term living facilities,” a spokesperson told Vox by email. While some of this confusion stemmed from longstanding disagreement on what exactly constitutes airborne spread, as late as March 2020 the WHO was still confidently tweeting, “FACT: #COVID19 is NOT airborne,” even as people were being infected through the air.\\n\\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a daily press briefing on Covid-19 on March 11, 2020. Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nTrump has also repeatedly criticized the WHO for not fully investigating the theory that the Covid-19 virus originated from virological work in a laboratory in Wuhan, rather than the conventional explanation that it began in wild animals sold at a meat market. The WHO sent a team of investigators to China in 2021, but Chinese scientists refused to discuss the so-called “lab leak” theory and then pressured investigators to dismiss the possibility altogether, according to the lead scientist on the team.\\n\\nAgain, though, the WHO has no authority to compel member states to turn over data or to cooperate on investigations. In fact, the WHO cannot even work inside a member state without that country’s permission. This is certainly a limitation of the WHO, but that’s because it answers to its member states — it is not some sort of supra-national health policy enforcement body.\\n\\nBeyond Covid, Trump has also griped that the WHO requires the US to make “unfairly onerous” payments, because US dues exceed the payment the organization demands of China, which has about four times the number of people as in the US.\\n\\nThe WHO is funded in two ways. The first is through assessed contributions, essentially membership dues, that each WHO member state is required to pay each year. The United Nations has a process for determining how much each country owes, but it’s essentially based on a country’s gross domestic product (GDP), not its population size.\\n\\nUS GDP in 2023 was about 1.5 times higher than China’s. That year, the US was required to pay the WHO $218 million, about two times more than China was assessed. So while the US does pay more than China, that difference is almost, though not quite, proportional to GDP.\\n\\nAssessed contributions, however, make up less than 20 percent of the WHO’s total funds. Its other funding comes from voluntary contributions from member states and non-governmental donors, such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\\n\\nHere is where the US and China make vastly different contributions to the WHO. In 2023, China gave the organization about $40 million in voluntary contributions plus an additional $935,000 toward an emergency fund on top of its assessed contribution, while the US government donated more than $1 billion in voluntary funds and about $47 million toward the emergency fund. In all, that meant the US gave the WHO about $1.27 billion in 2023, about 18 percent of their total budget, while China gave about $156 million when you tally up all contributions. So while the US does give vastly more to the WHO than China, most of that is in voluntary donations.\\n\\nOf course, the US doesn’t have to pull out of the WHO altogether to rectify this situation — it could simply choose to donate less to the WHO, or mandate that its contributions come with reform. And the institution does need reform.\\n\\nWho’s at fault at WHO, explained\\n\\nCovid wasn’t the first time the WHO came under international fire. Take the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\\n\\nThe organization was criticized back in 2014 for its long delay in declaring the outbreak a public health emergency, which hindered swift containment measures that could have prevented the virus from spreading across borders. From the start, the WHO fundamentally underestimated the severity of the outbreak — Ebola would go on to kill more than 11,000 people primarily in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, with scattered cases reported in the US and several European countries, too. It ultimately took the WHO and its partners two years to get the Ebola outbreak under control.\\n\\nDespite the number of deaths, Ebola’s spread was limited largely because it isn’t a respiratory disease like Covid-19; rather it spreads through direct contact with an infected person’s bodily fluids. But that fact makes the failure to contain Ebola all the more glaring.\\n\\nTo be fair, all outbreak and pandemic responses are chaotic, especially when an entirely novel virus like Covid starts spreading. New information is constantly emerging, and a lot of different individuals and institutions have to come together to coordinate the flow of information and the rollout of interventions or recommendations, even as the full picture of the outbreak is inevitably unclear. Outbreaks often happen in far-flung areas that lack health care workers, hospitals, laboratories, and even roads and internet. Cultural practices, economic conditions, and a preexisting lack of trust in politicians and health officials further complicate responses.\\n\\nA health worker waits to handle a new unconfirmed Ebola patient at a newly built Doctors Without Borders-supported Ebola treatment center on November 7, 2018, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. John Wessels/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nThe WHO also came under fire for delaying the dissemination of vaccines to help curb an ongoing mpox outbreak which began in May 2022 and spread to more than 120 countries before the virus became largely confined to central and eastern Africa.\\n\\nIn mid-2022, the US and EU approved an mpox vaccine made by the Danish pharmaceutical company Bavarian Nordic. But the WHO, which has its own process for reviewing and approving drugs and vaccines, did not approve the vaccine until September 2024.\\n\\nThat delay mattered. For one, other organizations like UNICEF and Gavi that play a critical role in procuring and distributing vaccines in developing countries require WHO approval before they can move forward with vaccination campaigns. Many developing countries do not have or have only pared-down versions of drug regulatory agencies so they also rely on the WHO to approve medicines before they roll them out in their countries, explained Rogério Gaspar, the director of WHO’s Department of Regulation and Prequalification. And so when it came to the mpox vaccine, many countries — especially in Africa, where the outbreak was most severe — were waiting for the green light from WHO before they could roll out the needed vaccines, even though the US and Europe had already approved them.\\n\\nThe WHO blames the long delay on Bavarian Nordic. The WHO claimed that the company did not submit the mpox vaccine for review until August 2024, some two years after the mpox outbreak had begun, and that once it did, the WHO approved it within two weeks, according to a WHO spokesperson.\\n\\nBut Bavarian Nordic refutes this timeline. A spokesperson told Vox that the pharmaceutical company first met with WHO in August 2022 and submitted a dossier on the vaccine in May 2023. The dossier they submitted to the WHO contained the same information that led to the European Medicines Agency, the equivalent of the FDA, approving the vaccine for use in Europe. It isn’t clear why the WHO didn’t act sooner. Back in August 2024, the WHO director of health product policy and standards, Deusdedit Mubangizi, told reporters that there wasn’t enough data to support its approval. But now, it seems, the WHO has changed its story, ducking accountability once again.\\n\\nThe entire process has frustrated some public health experts. “It’s almost like WHO saying, hey, we’re not responsible for our own process,” Jha said. “This is the lack of accountability. It’s everybody else’s fault.”\\n\\n(A WHO spokesperson pointed out that member states did not have to wait until the WHO’s review was complete to buy and distribute the vaccines.)\\n\\nOver the years, the WHO has tried to address its critics through a laundry list of reform efforts — and there has been some improvement. Between 2020 and 2022, smaller Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and Guinea have been contained in just a few months. That’s a hopeful signal the organization has potentially improved not only its own ability to quickly respond to outbreaks, but has also helped build member states’ capacity to detect and contain health emergencies. It also helps that since 2014, scientists have also developed a number of vaccines and treatments that would certainly help quell an outbreak.\\n\\nStill, while there were improvements in the Ebola response that can be attributable to the WHO, the organization’s dismal performance during the Covid-19 pandemic suggests that these reforms remain insufficient. And the bigger issue is that the WHO simply cannot admit its mistakes. The organization has still not come out and listed the errors it made during the Covid-19 pandemic. Though the WHO convened an independent panel of experts to review the international response to Covid-19, the panel’s reports largely focus on the failures of WHO member states and say little about the WHO’s own shortcomings.\\n\\n“There is very little interest at WHO in introspection,” Jha said. “There’s very little interest in WHO in figuring out how to do better.”\\n\\nAnd given how enormous — and how difficult — the WHO’s responsibilities are, that introspection is needed.\\n\\nThe WHO’s impossible task\\n\\nThe WHO’s mission is to foster global public health, but what that means in practice depends on what counts as global. As it stands, its 194 member states (193 without the US) have tasked the organization with outbreak prevention and response and other responsibilities that impact nearly all countries. That includes setting international health standards and collecting data on an ever-increasing list of health priorities ranging from maternal and child health and nutrition to sanitation and clean water. But some of the WHO’s work focuses on supplementing national health programs and filling gaps that benefit individual nations — specifically those with the least resources — rather than the world as a whole.\\n\\nThose responsibilities fit poorly with a Trump administration that is bringing an America First approach to health — and other countries are taking notice. Argentina has announced that it also plans to withdraw from the WHO, while Italian politicians have introduced legislation that would do the same. Other European countries have slashed global health aid budgets in recent years.\\n\\nThat the US cannot remain a WHO member while also consciously putting itself first highlights a friction in the field. Is global health about containing dangerous outbreaks so they don’t breach your own border and pose a threat to national security? Or is global health about saving lives and improving the health of everyone, regardless of their nationality? Can competing nation-states like China and the US set aside their political warfare and come together on one issue — health — or has the time for international cooperation finally ended?\\n\\nOne way to address that contradiction would be for the WHO to scale back on the number of health areas it is involved in and focus primarily on issues that actually transcend borders. This would include infectious diseases — but only those that present a truly global threat.\\n\\nThe WHO itself puts together a list of pathogens with the potential to cause a pandemic. It includes familiar diseases such as West Nile, Zika, Ebola, and Covid-19. Many of these have already caused deadly outbreaks and pandemics. Something else that transcends borders: products such as cigarettes or baby formula. The WHO might also have a role to play in regulating the safety of these products, according to Jesse Bump, a public health professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\\n\\nThis recommendation is not to say that newborn and maternal health or access to clean water are not important, life-saving services that everyone on Earth should have. But these represent more national health priorities for the countries dealing with these issues and not truly global threats.\\n\\nWithout some form of additional support, paring down the WHO’s focus areas would have fatal consequences for some places. Particularly in low-income countries, the WHO serves as a lifeline of essential health services and often fills many of the responsibilities that national health agencies in wealthy nations like the US handle, a WHO spokesperson explained.\\n\\nOf course, the fact that the WHO is tasked with addressing so many different areas of health fundamentally reflects both the massive health disparities around the world and the way the organization is funded. Consider the health challenges that a country like the US faces compared to many developing countries. In places like Niger, Papua New Guinea, Chad, and the DRC, more than half of the population does not have access to clean drinking water or basic water services. More than 50 percent of people in Somalia and Haiti are malnourished. In southern Africa, HIV is still a leading cause of death; in parts of West Africa, malaria is a leading cause of death.\\n\\nIn much of the global north, by contrast, these health challenges are virtually nonexistent, and where they are present, it’s because of national priorities, not a lack of national resources.\\n\\nConsider as well the drastic difference in the health workforce around the world. In many low- and middle-income counties, there are major shortages of doctors and nurses, not to mention specialists such as neurologists or surgeons. In more than 50 countries, mostly in Africa and the Middle East, there are fewer than one doctor per 1,000 people in the entire country. The US has almost four times as many doctors per capita.\\n\\nWhat this means is that the state of health and health care is so grossly unequal across countries that one organization cannot possibly address them all while also ensuring that every member states benefits equally from their WHO membership.\\n\\nAnd the benefits are unequal, at least in strict financial terms. Last year, countries in Africa and the WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean region — which includes parts of North Africa and the Middle East including some very poor and conflict-afflicted member states such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and Sudan — received $2.9 billion, almost half of the WHO’s $6.8 billion budget. The region of the Americas, which includes the US, received the least amount of funding, just over $300 million. But even here, it’s important to understand that the inequality in who gives and who gets from the WHO is largely a function of the fact that some regions and countries simply have a massively greater need for international aid.\\n\\nIt’s important to remember that the WHO has limited control over its own agenda. It is member states themselves who vote on the organization’s scope of work and approve its budget. Beyond the required payments, countries and other donors can earmark their voluntary funds for specific causes. The US, for instance, earmarks more than half of its funds for epidemic prevention or response and polio eradication while Nordic countries typically focus their funding on maternal health.\\n\\nThis approach to funding helps the WHO account for individual member state priorities but also allows countries to use funds to influence the WHO’s scope of work. Ultimately, it means that the WHO has little choice but to expand and scatter its workforce to make sure every country’s pet projects get completed.\\n\\nIs there any room for WHO in America First?\\n\\nShort of remaking the WHO into an institution under the leadership of the US government, it’s difficult to imagine that any amount of reform will satisfy the current administration. The organization’s mission is completely misaligned with Trump’s “America First” agenda. In the WHO, as in most other UN international bodies, America does not come first. It has the same vote as every other member state, even though the US contributes more money than any other country.\\n\\nBut despite its many shortcomings, the US needs the WHO. Only an international health agency such as the WHO can overcome the nuanced complexities of economic competition, geopolitics, and even outright war, to respond to global health emergencies. The WHO serves as a bridge for sharing information and even biological samples of pathogens, which is critical for understanding how a disease will spread and for developing medicines and vaccines.\\n\\nTrump’s vision of global health or public health, for that matter, is unclear. Just as unclear is whether Trump’s executive order on the WHO is even legal. Members of Congress have asked Trump to reconsider. Though the full impact of the US withdrawal will probably not be felt for about a year, the WHO’s director-general has already ordered a hiring freeze, mandated that some contracts be renegotiated, and directed staff in country offices to provide only essential support.\\n\\nAs the WHO adapts to a future without US investment, the Trump administration is also gutting other key global health efforts. This month, thousands of USAID staff were laid off, leaving only about 300 employees of a once 10,000-person workforce. It isn’t yet clear what global health areas the drastically smaller agency will work on — or whether it will exist at all — and it wouldn’t be surprising if the administration goes after other global health initiatives like the ones led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\nAmerican retreat from both the WHO and its own broader global health efforts paradoxically makes the case for WHO reform all the more important. Many complaints about how the WHO does its work are valid, especially given its reluctance to confront mistakes. But much of what it is criticized for is built into the way the institution itself operates or reflects a world with hugely varying health problems and national abilities to meet them. Still, the WHO must do better because it is the only organization uniquely placed to bridge diplomatic tensions and address international health threats. The most hopeful read on Trump’s action will shock the bureaucracy into action, and lead the Trump administration to ultimately realize that an American-first approach must include the WHO.'},\n",

(Saul Loeb/Pool Photo via AP, File)\\n\\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio -- Vivek Ramaswamy, the Cincinnati-born biotech entrepreneur who departed the Department of Government Efficiency initiative on President Donald Trump's first day, was expected to launch his bid for Ohio governor Monday.\\n\\nRamaswamy, 39, is set to kick off his campaign in Cincinnati, joining the 2026 Republican primary just a month after presumed frontrunner and then-Lt. Gov. Jon Husted left the running to take a U.S. Senate appointment.\\n\\nRamaswamy sought the GOP nomination for president in 2024 before dropping out to back Trump, who later tapped him to co-chair the efficiency initiative with billionaire Elon Musk. A near-billionaire himself, Ramaswamy has promoted his ties to Trump as he lines up key endorsements and donors in the governor's race, but the president has made no formal endorsement yet.\\n\\nRamaswamy joins a competitive GOP primary field to succeed Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, 78, a veteran center-right politician who is term-limited.\\n\\nOhio Attorney General Dave Yost announced a bid for the seat in January and Heather Hill, a Black entrepreneur from Appalachia, also is running. Dr. Amy Acton, the former state health director who helped lead Ohio through the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, is running as a Democrat.\\n\\nThey will compete in a former bellwether state that has tacked reliably red in recent years, having voted for Trump three times by more than 8 percentage points. Republicans also hold every statewide executive office, a majority on the Ohio Supreme Court and supermajorities in both legislative chambers.\\n\\nRamaswamy, who is Hindu, outlined the 10 core beliefs featured in his presidential campaign — led by “God is real” followed by “there are two genders” — in the 2024 book, “Truths: The Future of America First.” He first rose to political prominence with his 2021 book, “Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam,” a scorching critique of corporations that he said use social justice causes as a smokescreen for self-interested policies.\\n\\nHe seeks to buck the traditional route to Ohio's governorship, which runs through extensive government service often stretching decades, and instead mount a Trump-style ascent into the job directly from the business world.\\n\\nThe formula has worked for Vice President JD Vance and U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno, two political newcomers who won Senate seats with the help of Trump’s endorsement in 2022 and 2024, respectively. But Ramaswamy will test it in a state government-level race for the first time in recent memory.\\n\\nDeWine passed Ramaswamy over to appoint Husted to the Senate seat vacated by Vance, citing Husted’s decades of elective experience. The gubernatorial bid by Husted, a former Ohio House speaker and secretary of state, had locked down many key endorsements and wealthy donors, who are now largely free agents.\\n\\nYost joined the race as rumors circulated that Ramaswamy was planning a run. Since then, however, Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague and Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose have endorsed Ramaswamy.\"},\n",

Ingrassia has since been reassigned to work with the Department of Homeland Security, a White House official familiar with the matter told ABC News.\\n\\nTrump was reelected in November after promising to rid the Justice Department of what he alleged was political bias tainting federal law enforcement. Bondi has echoed that rhetoric, issuing a directive within hours of taking office to establish a \"Weaponization Working Group\" that she said would review all of the \"politicized\" investigations previously targeting Trump.\\n\\nAccording to Ingrassia\\'s LinkedIn page, he became \"President Trump\\'s White House Liaison for DOJ\" in January.

When Bondi held her first press conference two weeks ago to announce a civil lawsuit against state leaders in New York for their immigration policies that she said value \"illegal aliens over American citizens,\" Mizelle stood on stage behind her and helped answer a question from a reporter.\\n\\nOn Friday, Mizelle filed a publicly-released complaint with the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, accusing a federal judge of \"hostile and egregious misconduct\" in his handling of a case challenging Trump\\'s recent efforts to limit or ban transgender service members. The judge has not yet responded to the complaint.\\n\\nIngrassia, before joining the Trump administration last month, led communications efforts for a nonprofit legal organization that promotes itself as \"the answer to the useless and radically leftist American Civil Liberties Union,\" and he was a writer for the right-wing website Gateway Pundit.\\n\\nTrump was known to repost some of Ingrassia\\'s pro-Trump stories on social media.\\n\\nIngrassia graduated from Cornell Law School in May 2022, less than three years ago, according to his LinkedIn page.

Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.\\n\\nChris Christie’s flight from Detroit landed in Newark, N.J., on Thursday and was one of the unlucky arrivals without a dedicated gate assignment. Tired and cranky, the former New Jersey Governor lumbered onto a bus ferrying passengers back to the terminal, where the woman seated beside him started unpacking the unpredictable state of politics, particularly President Donald Trump’s chaotic first few weeks back in power.\\n\\n“She said, ‘You know, he's really shaking things up, and maybe some of that will turn out OK,’” Christie recalled two days later at the Principles First Summit, a confab of traditionalist Republicans trying to chart their way through the next four years of Trumpism. “At that moment, when I'm at the end of my travel day, my Sicilian instinct is to grab her by the shoulders and go, ‘Are you kidding me?’”\\n\\nBut Christie, who ran against Trump for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, ran afoul of his mercurial nature, and subsequently found himself exiled, listened politely before offering a self-aware question to her: “What about everything you've seen about him for the last 10 years leads you to believe that it might turn out OK?”\\n\\nIn Christie’s telling, the woman in question said it was important for anyone in the presidency to succeed. Christie, uncharacteristically, was prepared to let the chat end there, but not his parable for an audience of hard-core NeverTrumpers, disaffected Republicans, and more than a few self-identified Democrats looking for answers in this charged period.\\n\\n“There's going to come a moment where that woman, I believe in my heart, is going to say, ‘Yeah, no, this is not OK anymore,’” Christie said. “But we all get there at a different pace.”\\n\\nAnd then the former prosecutor summed up the ethos for that sold-out thinkfest held a few blocks from the White House back in Trump’s control.\\n\\n“To the extent that we try to force that pace because we can't stand it anymore, we run the risk of lengthening it, not shortening it,” he said. “And a lot of damage could be done.”\\n\\nWelcome to the latest iteration of the Conservative Resistance. They are angry, they are motivated, and they are altogether at a loss at what to do with those feelings. This year’s Principles First summit, it’s fifth, offered its usual blend of anti-Trump fervor and pragmatic posturing about how to reclaim a Republican Party and conservative movement with which they once comfortably identified. On the same day that Trump regaled the more boisterous crowd just across the river at CPAC with his tales of political retribution, several hundred activists and insiders gathered in downtown D.C. to make sense of their current impotence.\\n\\nIn the room, much of the rhetoric came off as scorching and inspired, as if a solution to the ongoing dismantling of much of the federal government were just over the horizon. Beyond the basement ballroom, though, it sure seemed lukewarm. It was a wait-it-out strategy that, frankly, is not entirely dissimilar to the approach Democrats are taking on their side of the observation deck. The path forward in no way matched the appetite for immediate action. It felt, at times, like being promised a decadent five-course meal and realizing later you had been served a rice cake.\\n\\nDark humor and worries about democracy’s nadir frequently intersected in the basement of the J.W. Marriott. When former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales mused that maybe “Congress will say enough is enough,” the ballroom giggled with skepticism. Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson similarly drew laughs when he suggested Congress will assert its check over the presidency: “I’m optimistic that they will at the right time. And it may be very, very soon.”\\n\\nYet former Rep. Joe Walsh, a Tea Party founder from Illinois, said no one should count on the group he once counted himself a member to do their jobs: “Forget about Republicans in Congress. They’re done.”\\n\\nBillionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban was similarly dismissive of those who thought wailing about Trump tearing down democracy would get the public on their side. “How’d that work in the campaign?” he needled.\\n\\nThe gathering seemed simultaneously poisoned by pessimism and laden with pleas to give Trump time to reveal himself as a true threat to All Things American. The job of harnessing that outrage, the argument went, will get easier once Trump inevitably hands his critics a full dossier of second-term over-reach. As one introducer ticked through Trump’s foreign policy changes so far, he seemed out of breath by the end of the partial list. “That was in one month,” he said. “There are 47 months left.”\\n\\nBut talk of waiting things out was constantly in tension with what many saw as an urgent moment in history that demanded action.\\n\\n“This is the collapse of an American ideal, American ideology, the American view of the world,” said Tom Nichols, a retired academic who now writes for The Atlantic.\\n\\nTo his right on stage, one of the most recognized democracy advocates, chess grandmaster and Russian dissident Garry Kasparov, offered a polite correction. “We are not watching the collapse of the American ideal. We are watching the betrayal of the American ideal,” Kasparov said. “We are living in the middle of the coup.”\\n\\nAs the day’s sessions neared its end, Sarah Longwell, a political strategist and publisher of The Bulwark, deadpanned, “This has been a long day and is terrifying,” before calling the President “a fabulist, a liar, and a bad person.” No one really objected to the verdict, but it was not apparent what to do with it.\\n\\n(Before the Summit closed out on Sunday, organizers announced they had received “a credible bomb threat” from someone claiming to be Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the Proud Boys, forcing a temporary evacuation. Tarrio reportedly denied any involvement.)\\n\\nWhile adopting a resigned wait-it-out slouch, a running thread at the summit came down to a simple but actionable question: At what point has the United States entered into a constitutional crisis? Trump has been musing that he was not subject to court rulings, might serve a third term, and could start annexing the Panama Canal, Canada, and Greenland.\\n\\nGonzales, who served as President George W. Bush’s top lawyer and ran his Justice Department, but endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris last year, said he is waiting to see if Trump ignores an inevitable setback from the courts. “Until that happens, we don’t have a constitutional crisis,” Gonzales said. Added Hutchinson, a former U.S. attorney: “We’re not there yet.” And Christie, another former U.S. attorney, said he, too, is concerned about the looming crisis, but warned that the language is being too casually bandied about.\\n\\n“I think we use this ‘constitutional crisis’ thing much too liberally,” Christie said. “What we're doing is cheating, because when we really do have the constitutional crisis, half the country is going to go…” He then uttered a verbal shrug that could possibly be transcribed as “meh.”\\n\\nIn the room, folks nodded along with a dour expectation that they too were going to be using that rhetoric at some point. It may just be as premature as it is inevitable. Patience is far from sexy, but it may be the best strategy to allow for Trump to trip over traps of his own making. Yet those most committed to restoring traditional conservative footing in the GOP are anxious to do more than stand by at this specific moment.\\n\\n“The resistance will rise,” said Bill Kristol, a self-described hawk who served as chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle. “But will it rise quickly enough?” In the crowd, there were visible shaking of heads.\\n\\nMake sense of what matters in Washington.

       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': 'Washington — The Trump administration has prepared plans to implement a policy that would allow U.S. immigration officials to swiftly expel migrants on the grounds that they could spread diseases like tuberculosis, according to internal government documents obtained by CBS News.\\n\\nThe plans would revive a border measure known as Title 42 that the first Trump administration enacted at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 to authorize summary expulsions of migrants. The Biden administration kept that policy in place amid record levels of illegal crossings at the U.S. southern border until letting it expire in 2023.\\n\\nThe revival of Title 42 would also add another layer to an unprecedented web of border measures enacted by President Trump since taking office to close down the American asylum system.\\n\\nOne of those actions has allowed U.S. border officials to quickly deport migrants from the U.S., without granting them an opportunity to request asylum, a right foreigners have under domestic and international refugee law. The authority underpinning that policy, called 212(f), permits presidents to ban the entry of foreigners whose arrival is deemed to be \"detrimental\" to the U.S.\\n\\nBut the new measure would invoke the Public Health Service Act, found in Title 42 of the U.S. code, to empower officials to expel migrants without any of the processing outlined in federal immigration law, which says those on U.S. soil can request asylum even if they enter the country illegally.\\n\\nThe internal documents obtained by CBS News indicate the CDC is planning to issue an order that would label unauthorized migrants trying to enter the U.S. as public health risks, citing concerns that they could spread communicable diseases like tuberculosis.\\n\\nCustoms and Border Protection officials would be charged with enforcing the CDC\\'s order and directed to expeditiously expel migrants to Mexico, their home country or third nations willing to accept them, the documents show. Just like the 212(f) proclamation, the Title 42 order would allow border agents to ignore U.S. immigration law, denying migrants the right to seek asylum.\\n\\nIt\\'s unclear when exactly the administration plans to invoke Title 42, but officials across agencies have been preparing for the policy change. Representatives for the CDC and the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CBP, did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nThe renewed invocation of Title 42 would likely be contested by public health experts. In 2020, the Trump administration pressured the CDC to invoke Title 42, despite opposition from subject matter experts at the agency who believed the move was not rooted in public health and was instead a way for officials to further President Trump\\'s immigration crackdown.\\n\\nWhile the stated rationale behind the invocation of Title 42 is to reduce overcrowding in immigration detention facilities and the potential spread of diseases, migrant crossings at the southern border have plunged since Mr. Trump\\'s inauguration.\\n\\nOfficials have been recording an average of fewer than 300 illegal border crossings per day recently, a more than 90% drop from February 2024, Border Patrol chief Mike Banks told CBS News in an interview on Thursday.\\n\\nDr. Scott Gottlieb, who was commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration during Mr. Trump\\'s first term, told \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that he was \"not sure\" why the government is \"reaching for a public health measure\" when border enforcement policies appear to be working.\\n\\n\"Just from the objective standpoint of TB and the risk of TB being transported across the border, TB incidence rates are high in the countries where immigrants are coming from, but they\\'re not exceedingly high relative to other countries,\" Gottlieb said, pointing to countries like India and South Africa. \"I think, just purely from an objective public health standpoint, there\\'s probably parts of the world where we have immigrants coming in that provide a larger risk of the transmission of TB than across the border.\"\\n\\nThe Trump administration\\'s plan will also almost certainly trigger legal challenges. Federal judges found that the COVID-era Title 42 order could not override U.S. asylum law or legal protections Congress created for unaccompanied children, whom the Trump administration expelled under the measure.\\n\\nHow the Title 42 order would interact with Mr. Trump\\'s other border policies, including the 212(f) proclamation, is unclear. But the 212(f) order is at risk of being halted by the courts due to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union.\\n\\n\"It\\'s clear that they\\'re just sort of pulling out all the stops, and the goal is literally stopping people from entering the United States, not processing anybody under the immigration law,\" said Theresa Cardinal Brown, a former U.S. immigration official during the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-24T12:10:38',\n",
       "   'content': \"LOADING ERROR LOADING\\n\\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration moved its fast-paced dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development toward what appeared to be its final phases, telling all but a fraction of staffers worldwide that they were on leave as of Monday and notifying at least 1,600 of the U.S.-based staffers they were being fired.\\n\\nThe move was the latest and one of the biggest steps in what President Donald Trump and cost-cutting ally Elon Musk say is their goal of gutting the six-decade-old aid and development agency in a broader campaign to slash the size of the federal government.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe move comes after a federal judge on Friday allowed the administration to move forward with its plan to pull thousands of USAID staffers off the job in the United States and around the world. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols rejected pleas in a lawsuit from employees to keep temporarily blocking the government’s plan.\\n\\n“As of 11:59 p.m. EST on Sunday, February 23, 2025, all USAID direct hire personnel, with the exception of designated personnel responsible for mission-critical functions, core leadership and/or specially designated programs, will be placed on administrative leave globally,” according to the notices sent to USAID workers that were viewed by The Associated Press.\\n\\nAt the same time, the agency said in the notices to staffers that it was beginning a firing process called reduction in force that would eliminate 2,000 U.S.-based jobs. A version of the notice posted later on USAID’s website put the number of positions to be eliminated lower, at 1,600.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe administration gave no explanation for the discrepancy. USAID and the State Department did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\\n\\nWithin hours of that notice, individual staffers began reporting receiving the notices of their upcoming dismissal under the reduction in force.\\n\\nThe Trump appointee running USAID, deputy administrator Pete Marocco, has indicated he plans to keep about 600 mostly U.S.-based staffers on the job in the meantime, in part to arrange travel for USAID staffers and families abroad.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe move escalates a monthlong push to dismantle the agency, which has included closing its headquarters in Washington and shutting down thousands of aid and development programs worldwide following a freeze on all foreign assistance. A judge later temporarily blocked the funding freeze. Trump and Musk contend that USAID’s work is wasteful and furthers a liberal agenda.\\n\\nLawsuits by government workers’ unions, USAID contractors and others say the administration lacks the constitutional authority to eliminate an independent agency or congressionally funded programs without lawmakers’ approval.\\n\\nThe Trump administration efforts upend decades of U.S. policy that aid and development work overseas serves national security by stabilizing regions and economies and building alliances.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe notices of firings and leaves come on top of hundreds of USAID contractors receiving no-name form letters of termination in the past week, according to copies that AP viewed.\\n\\nThe blanket nature of the notification letters to USAID contractors, excluding the names or positions of those receiving them, could make it difficult for the dismissed workers to get unemployment benefits, workers noted.\\n\\nA different judge in a second lawsuit tied to USAID said this past week that the administration had kept withholding foreign aid despite his order temporarily blocking the funding freeze and must restore the funding to programs worldwide.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe separate ruling from Nichols, a Trump appointee, on Friday also cleared the way for the administration to start the clock on a planned 30-day deadline for USAID staffers and their families to return home if they want their travel paid for by the government.\\n\\nThe judge said he was satisfied by Trump administration assurances that workers abroad would be allowed to stay in their jobs while on leave beyond the 30 days even if they chose to remain overseas.\\n\\nGo Ad-Free — And Protect The Free Press The next four years will change America forever.

       "   'content': \"LOADING ERROR LOADING\\n\\nLinda McMahon, President Donald Trump’s pick to run the Department of Education, appears to be fully on board with destroying the agency she’s set to run.\\n\\nIn a series of questions asked by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Andy Kim (D-N.J.) after McMahon’s confirmation hearing before the Senate education panel earlier this month, the nominee said she “wholeheartedly supports” Trump’s plan to abolish the department.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“President Trump believes that the bureaucracy in Washington should be abolished so that we can return education to the states, where it belongs,” McMahon wrote, according to her testimony shared with HuffPost. “I wholeheartedly support and agree with this mission.”\\n\\nAt the hearing, McMahon was more careful with her words, saying that Trump would like to “look, in totality, at the Department of Education,” and said she “believes that the bureaucracy of it should be closed.” She also repeatedly noted that Trump does not have the power to unilaterally shut down the agency and would need to work with Congress.\\n\\n“Linda McMahon has made herself clear: She will do whatever Donald Trump asks her to do — including shutting down the agency she is supposed to lead, which supports millions of students trying to receive an education,” Warren told HuffPost. “Confirming her as education secretary would be a disaster for the success of students and teachers in public schools.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nRepublicans have intermittently griped about shutting down the Department of Education since it was created in 1980. But with Trump’s election — and as right-wing culture warriors like the group Moms for Liberty continue to make misleading claims about “woke ideology” being forced on children in the nation’s public schools — that decades-old goal has inched closer to reality.\\n\\nThe Education Department doesn’t have much sway over the specifics of curricula. It is mostly tasked with providing resources for low-income schools, ensuring equal access to education and administering federal student loans.\\n\\n“I’d like it to be closed immediately,” Trump said the day before McMahon’s confirmation hearing. “The Department of Education’s a big con job.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAfter issuing executive orders that threaten to withhold funding from public schools that teach about “diversity, equity and inclusion” or the existence of transgender people, multiple reports said that the White House was planning an executive order that would seek to shut down the agency, if Congress approves.\\n\\nIn their post-hearing questions, Warren and Kim asked whether or not she’d commit to funding for various programs, like ones that seek to strengthen historically Black universities or protect the civil rights of students. They also asked her about her thoughts on protecting the privacy of Americans. Officials from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have reportedly attempted to access sensitive information at the agency.\\n\\nBefore the hearing, members of Congress were denied entry to the agency’s building by DOGE, and multiple groups sued the Trump administration over who has access to its private information.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhen asked by Warren and Kim about DOGE’s data access, McMahon didn’t seem bothered by it.\\n\\n“My understanding is that all DOGE employees are in full compliance with the law,” she answered.\\n\\nThe first month of Trump’s return to power has been marked by chaos; DOGE officials have shown up at federal agencies, deemed a program or grant they don’t like to be in violation of Trump’s anti-DEI order or simply label it as fraud or waste, and try to slash it. Already, Musk has bragged about canceling $900 million worth of contracts from the Institute for Education Sciences, the agency’s research arm. The DOGE team has also tried to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development and other government entities.\\n\\nFederal agencies only receive funding after it’s been appropriated by Congress. Advocates are worried Musk and the DOGE team could run the same playbook on the Department of Education — that is, withholding money that Congress has already approved.\\n\\nWarren and Kim asked McMahon if she would commit to not suspending or cutting any money appropriated by Congress — like funds for federal student aid, teacher training programs, rural schools and more — McMahon repeatedly answered, “I will follow the law.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMcMahon’s refusal to go into specifics or commit to funding for a variety of important programs at the agency was reminiscent of her nomination hearing. Then, she also refused to answer if schools would be at risk of losing their funding if they hosted ethnic clubs or groups that went against Trump’s executive orders.\\n\\nDrastically reducing the department’s funding, or shutting it down completely, would be a disaster for the millions of children who rely on it to provide access to education and protect their civil rights.\\n\\nGo Ad-Free — And Protect The Free Press The next four years will change America forever.

       "   'time': '2025-02-21T20:27:14',\n",
       "   'content': \"The day before Donald Trump’s inauguration, ACLU lawyer Chase Strangio wrote that the administration’s executive orders would be “glorified press releases” that won’t change the law, but will aim to create confusion and chaos among people who are already scared. That prediction has largely proved true, as seen in Trump’s EOs purporting to end birthright citizenship, ban medical care for transgender youth, and claw back government funding.\\n\\nThere’s another kind of executive action, though, which also leaves the law unchanged, but seeks to create the illusion of an accomplishment that’s popular with the electorate. In that bucket we can file Trump’s executive order on in vitro fertilization.\\n\\nIf there’s one industry that doesn’t need Silicon Valley’s mentality of “move fast and break things,” it’s the one that creates and stores embryos.\\n\\nThe order, signed on Tuesday, says that a domestic policy aide has 90 days to submit “a list of policy recommendations on protecting IVF access and aggressively reducing out-of-pocket and health plan costs for IVF treatment.” In short, Trump is asking for concepts of a plan to be delivered at a later date. As USA Today explained: “The order signed Tuesday has no immediate impact on the cost of IVF or expanding access to reproductive treatments.” Still, that didn’t stop White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt from declaring on X — in all caps, no less — that it was an example of “promises made, promises kept.”\\n\\nAccess to IVF became a tangible issue during the presidential campaign when, in February 2024, the Alabama state Supreme Court ruled that IVF embryos are considered children for purposes of wrongful death lawsuits. Without the protections of \\u200b\\u200bRoe v. Wade, states can define life as beginning at fertilization, which could limit access to fertility treatments in addition to banning abortion.\\n\\nTrump, who repeatedly bragged about his role in getting the Supreme Court to overturn Roe, scrambled to seem supportive of IVF after the Alabama ruling. In August, he even claimed that if he won, not only would he protect IVF, but that the expensive treatments would be paid for by the government or insurance companies. “We are going to be, under the Trump administration, we are going to be paying for that treatment,” Trump told NBC News in August, adding, “We’re going to be mandating that the insurance company pay.”\\n\\nTrump doubled down on the proposal at a Michigan event a day later, and blurted out one reason for it: “Because we want more babies, to put it nicely.” While the promised mandate did not survive to this year, the motivation did: A fact sheet accompanying the order mentions the country’s declining birthrate.\\n\\nThe order also says it’s the administration’s policy to increase access by “easing unnecessary statutory or regulatory burdens to make IVF treatment drastically more affordable.” But deregulation would be “misguided,” as \\u200b\\u200bGeorgetown University Law Center professor Susan Crockin told The Cut. “Current regulation of standard-of-care IVF treatments and laboratories help make IVF both more effective and safer for patients and the families they hope to create; removing them could undermine those important safeguards,” she said. If there’s one industry that doesn’t need Silicon Valley’s mentality of “move fast and break things,” it’s the one that creates and stores embryos.\\n\\nThe order got largely positive or neutral coverage from most media outlets, and that may have been the point.\\n\\nIf Trump actually wanted to “make IVF treatment drastically more affordable,” he wouldn’t need to order aides to study anything. He could ask Congress to pass a bill that either further entrenches the Affordable Care Act by requiring insurance coverage of IVF, or massively increases the federal budget to pay for IVF treatments.\\n\\nOr Trump could simply endorse the existing Right to IVF Act from Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill. Her bill would create a right to access fertility services, including IVF, and would require employer-sponsored plans and public insurance including Medicaid and military TRICARE plans to cover the treatments. Crucially, Duckworth's bill says that state laws can’t restrict access to IVF based on someone’s marital status or sexual orientation, meaning treatments must also be covered for single women and queer couples. (Currently, many plans require a diagnosis of infertility, which is not relevant to these people.)\\n\\nBut Trump won’t take any of those steps, nor will his party. Republicans blocked Duckworth’s bill twice last year alone. And now they want to cut hundreds of billions in health spending.\\n\\nDuckworth said in a statement that Trump’s “toothless” executive order “does nothing to expand access to IVF. In fact, he’s the reason IVF is at risk in the first place.” She added that if Trump actually wants to deliver on his campaign promise, he can call on Republicans to support her bill. “Otherwise, it’s all just lip service from a known liar.”\\n\\nBut the order got largely positive or neutral coverage from most media outlets, and that may have been the point. Like most presidents, Trump’s approval rating and personal popularity have fallen since his inauguration. A Washington Post-Ipsos poll published Thursday, for example, found that 57% of respondents said Trump has exceeded his authority since taking office. People oppose pardoning the Jan. 6 rioters, deporting undocumented immigrants who aren’t criminals, firing government workers and delegating agency-slashing power to billionaire Elon Musk.\\n\\nWhatever good press comes from glorified press releases only lasts for so long. After that fades, Trump will be left with, at best, nothing to show for his EO — and, at worse, deregulation that will make IVF less safe and less effective for millions of Americans.\"},\n",

He told the Conservative Political Action Conferenc last week that his vision for the centre is “to make art great again”, including “a big, huge celebration of the birth of Christ at Christmas”.\\n\\nTrump’s shock decision to seize control of the Kennedy Center, with a loyal apparatchik in charge, has put his anti-woke “Maga” populism on collision course with America’s progressive cultural scene like never before. Performers are cancelling shows, donors are questioning their support and audience members are threatening to boycott. It is the biggest crisis in the 54-year history of the Kennedy Center, the crown jewel of performing arts in the nation’s capital.\\n\\nSupported by government money and private donations and attracting millions of visitors each year, the centre is a 100ft-high complex on the banks of the Potomac River featuring a concert hall, opera house and theatre, along with a lecture hall, meeting spaces and a “Millennium Stage” that has been the site for free shows.\\n\\nIt has long been a bipartisan enterprise, first conceived during the administration of the Republican president Dwight Eisenhower, who backed a bill from the Democratic-led Congress calling for a “national culture center”. It was later designated as a living memorial to President John F Kennedy, a Democrat, after his assassination.\\n\\nConstruction began in 1965 and the centre formally opened in 1971 with a premiere of Leonard Bernstein’s Mass. Five years later, within view of the Watergate complex, it hosted the premiere of the film All the President’s Men, starring Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman as the journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.\\n\\nThe centre presents theatre, contemporary dance, ballet, vocal music, chamber music, hip-hop, comedy and jazz and also serves as the home to the National Symphony Orchestra and Washington National Opera. It has hosted artists ranging from the Paul Taylor Dance Company to a joint concert by Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga. Its educational initiatives reach more than 2.1 million teachers and students.\\n\\nOther highlights include the annual Mark Twain prize for comedy, with recipients including Lorne Michaels, Tina Fey and Bob Newhart, and the annual Kennedy Center Honors for outstanding artists, most recently Francis Ford Coppola, Bonnie Raitt and the Grateful Dead, among others.\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Francis Ford Coppola attends the 2024 Kennedy Center honours. Photograph: Taylor Hill/FilmMagic\\n\\nAll this is now in jeopardy. Earlier this month Trump ousted chair David Rubenstein, a billionaire philanthropist, and installed himself to preside over a board that by tradition was divided between Democratic and Republican appointees but is now predominantly Republican, with recent additions including the country star Lee Greenwood and the White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles.\\n\\nThe Kennedy Center president, Deborah Rutter, brought on by Rubenstein in 2014, was fired soon after the board shake-up, along with the centre’s general counsel and head of public relations. Rutter told National Public Radio (NPR): “I’m really, really, really sad about what happens to our artists, what happens on our stages and our staff who support them. The Kennedy Center is meant to be a beacon for the arts in all of America across the country.”\\n\\nTrump wrote on social media that Grenell “shares my Vision for a GOLDEN AGE of American Arts and Culture” and would be overseeing “daily operations” to ensure “NO MORE DRAG SHOWS, OR OTHER ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA”. But he also admitted to reporters that he had not attended performances at the centre.\\n\\nThe cultural community was stunned by the velocity of the takeover. Amy Austin, president and chief executive of Theatre Washington, says: “It was shocking to have that come so suddenly and so early in an administration that is making so many changes. For them to act as if there needed to be programmic changes at the Kennedy Centre when referring to one drag show and not acknowledge the work that’s done there was ridiculous.\\n\\n“There was no cause given for the need for change. Ever since the institution was founded it’s always been a bipartisan place. The board of trustees was always a mixed group of people who, we would say in DC, come from different sides of the aisle but come together around the arts. And then it was summarily dismissed.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe radical overhaul comes as Trump and his ally Elon Musk scythe through the federal government on a mission to root out waste and inefficiency. The Kennedy Center had a budget of $268m last year, with $225m flowing from ticket sales and donations and $43m coming from taxpayers to cover building operations and maintenance.\\n\\nLast week Grenell raised concerns about the centre’s finances in a post on X, claiming that its chief financial officer acknowledged having “ZERO cash on hand”. A staff member at the centre, who wishes to remain anonymous, dismisses that as an “absolute fabrication”, “complete manipulation of the data” and “manufactured crisis”.\\n\\nThe source says: “The real crisis we’re facing, in addition to people rescinding their membership, is that we’re normally finalising our season at this time and it’s been completely turned upside down. You see performers pulling out and that has real ramifications for staff and morale. We feel like we’re walking on eggshells. But I want to convey the amazing leadership my colleagues are showing in an untenable situation.”\\n\\nThe changes have sparked significant backlash. Kennedy Center consultants such as the musician Ben Folds and singer Renée Fleming resigned and the actor Issa Rae and author Louise Penny cancelled appearances. The Manhattan Theater Club announced that it would not bring Eureka Day, a satire about a school forced to reconsider its liberal vaccine policy, for a planned two-week run “due to financial circumstances”.\\n\\nDuring a concert that proceeded as scheduled, the singer-songwriter Victoria Canal wore a T-shirt reading “ANTI TRUMP AF”. Stand-up comedian W Kamau Bell lambasted the president during his set and, in a dig at a pro-Trump musician, asked: “How many times can you give Kid Rock the Mark Twain award?”\\n\\nThe source says further big names are withdrawing. “It’s more than you’ve heard so far. That is the existential threat we’re facing. We were just about to initiate the selection of this year’s Kennedy Center honorees; all of this has been upended.\\n\\n“This coup is antithetical to the founding of the institution. The Kennedy Center is a neutral space, non-partisan by design, where everyone can see themselves on the stage. Thrusting it into a political space like this is unconscionable. This is not what we signed up for.\\n\\n“This is warfare. It’s an attack on freedom of expression and speech. It’s repressive. It’s unAmerican. The Kennedy Center is a pipeline to the broader arts ecosystem. There will be ripple effects across the whole cultural ecology if the Kennedy Center is not playing its role.”\\n\\nView image in fullscreen The Kennedy Center. Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/AP\\n\\nNowhere in Washington do politics and culture meet as they do at the Kennedy Center. An 8ft-tall bronze bust of John F Kennedy sits in the grand foyer and an 81-inch bronze statue of him stands on the adjacent Reach campus. Upstairs a permanent exhibition explores the 35th president’s relationship with the arts. Shops feature books by and about Kennedy and his wife Jackie along with magnets, mugs and other merchandise.\\n\\nKennedy’s words about the role of culture in society are inscribed in the exterior marble walls of the complex. Their highbrow references would be unthinkable for any US president today and are almost absurdly contrary to Trump’s ingrained anti-intellectualism and anti-elitism.\\n\\nFor example: “There is a connection, hard to explain logically but easy to feel, between achievement in public life and progress in the arts. The age of Pericles was also the age of Phidias. The age of Lorenzo de Medici was also the age of Leonardo da Vinci. The age of Elizabeth also the age of Shakespeare. And the New Frontier for which I campaign in public life, can also be a New Frontier for American art.”\\n\\nKerry Kennedy, his niece, was at the 1971 grand opening and in 2000 saw her book Speak Truth to Power turned into a play there by the Argentinian-Chilean writer Ariel Dorfman. Featuring actors such as Sigourney Weaver, Alec Baldwin, John Malkovich, Alfre Woodard and Giancarlo Esposito, the performance was attended by President Bill Clinton and human rights defenders from across the world.\\n\\nShe recalls: “For a lot of the people in that audience, it was an important part of the healing process. To me that one performance encapsulates why the arts are so vitally important for our country, for democracy and for the world.”\\n\\nBut the speed and scale of Trump’s actions are unlike anything the Kennedy Center has experienced in its history. Kennedy describes the firing of Rubenstein – who donated $120m to the organisation over 20 years – as “crude and rude and ungrateful”. She is concerned about Trump reshaping the centre to reflect his own preferences and potentially eliminating content he deems objectionable.\\n\\nKennedy, who is president of Robert F Kennedy Human Rights, admits: “I do worry about it, not as an abstraction but because we’ve already seen it with the AP [Associated Press] being barred from White House events for refusing to go along with what the White House dictates. That’s very dangerous for democracy and has grave implications for what will happen not just at the Kennedy Center but for government funding of the arts across the country.”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe adds: “It’s the assault on our democracy that concerns me. I’ve worked for 40 years on stopping autocracies from repressing people’s voices and the one consistent pattern is they go after the arts, so that’s very dangerous.”\\n\\nOthers share concerns that Trump will cause lasting damage to the Kennedy Center’s reputation as a space for diverse artistic expression. It could enter a death spiral in which artists and donors are alienated, ticket sales decline, programming shifts in a more populist direction and its status as a non-partisan institution is shattered.\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Bruce Springsteen and Gary Clark Jr perform at the Kennedy Center. Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images\\n\\nPeter Marks, who was the Washington Post’s chief theatre critic from 2002 to 2023, says: “It’s so distressing and potentially ruinous for the foreseeable future. Once an institution becomes weaponised, once an arts organisation takes such a dramatic shift away from its mission, it’s very hard to get it back to what it was. People stop thinking of it as theirs and think of it as belonging to someone else. Once that happens, the alienation is disastrous.”\\n\\nThe Trump brand could prove toxic. Marks adds: “Which artists in this country are going to want to be aligned on a title page in a programme with Donald Trump’s name at the top of it? It changes the whole question of the relationship between an artist and their audience and why they’re there.\\n\\n“I doubt that many producers are going to pull, for example, their theatre productions at this point – it’s too financially difficult – but I wonder how many artists are going to be able to stomach lending their name to anything marketing-wise for the Kennedy Center. It remains to be seen just how deep the wound is in the short term.”\\n\\nTrump mostly ignored the centre during his first term, becoming the first president to routinely skip the honours ceremony. One honouree, producer Norman Lear, had threatened not to attend if Trump was there. It remains uncertain whether the president will show up this year – and whether artists will stay away as a result.\\n\\nRecently on social media Trump posted an AI-generated image of himself waving his arms like a conductor in a concert hall and wrote: “Welcome to the New Kennedy Center!” What might a Trump-infused artistic programme look like? In a phone call to the Kennedy Center board obtained by CNN, he promised: “We’re going to make it hot. And we made the presidency hot, so this should be easy.”\\n\\nAnd at CPAC last week, when Grenell was asked what he thought the ideal performance at the Kennedy Center would be, he chose the country singer Dolly Parton. “I would love to see it,” he said.\\n\\nIndeed, his boss’s cultural palate is frozen in the 20th century. Trump is known to admire singers such as Elvis Presley and films such as Citizen Kane, The Godfather, Gone with the Wind and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.\\n\\nHis campaign rallies warm up with numbers from the Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals Cats and The Phantom of the Opera, open with Greenwood’s God Bless the USA and close with the Village People’s YMCA. His celebrity supporters include Mel Gibson, Dennis Quaid, Kid Rock, Sylvester Stallone and Jon Voight. Lara Trump, his daughter-in-law, is an aspiring singer seemingly immune to bad reviews.\\n\\nSteve Bannon, a longtime Trump adviser, mischievously proposed an opening night performance by the J6 Prison Choir, consisting of people jailed for the 6 January 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol only to be later pardoned by Trump. Bannon also described the Kennedy Center “as the high church of the secular, atheist administrative state that runs the imperial capital”.\\n\\nTrump’s attempt to control or neuter cultural institutions plays into a long history of authoritarians using the arts to push their agenda. One source in the Washington theatre industry drew comparison with Andrei Zhdanov, the Soviet politician whose doctrine sought to define permissible revolutionary art and labelled “incorrect art” as counter-revolutionary. The source said: “We are entering a Socialist Realist moment in American cultural policy. The purge is already happening. And there is a climate of fear at arts institutions. It’s a scary time.”\\n\\nMarks, the theatre critic, agrees that a “war on the arts” has been declared but adds: “The louder the war becomes, the more vociferous the response will be and you will find a whole rising up of writers and musicians and directors and actors who are going to find other avenues of expression that will, I hope, show up this disastrous tack that the government has taken and actually compel some great art.\\n\\n“That’s what’s going to happen because it’s inevitable. Outrage feeds contemplation ultimately and we’re going to all find out what that means over the next few years.”'},\n",

       "   'content': 'covers politics Vox. She first joined Vox in 2019, and her work has also appeared in Politico, Washington Monthly, and the New Republic.\\n\\nElon Musk, accompanied by his son X Musk and President Donald Trump, speaks during an executive order signing in the Oval Office at the White House on February 11, 2025. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump is no stranger to conspiracy: He rose to political prominence by touting the racist lie that Barack Obama was born in Kenya. His team isn’t either: Take Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s longtime baseless conviction that childhood vaccines cause autism or the billionaire Elon Musk’s promotion of the 2016 “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory.\\n\\nThe embrace of conspiracy theories isn’t new, but now that Trump is back in power, there is a direct pipeline between online conspiracy theories and government policy — and in some cases, it’s happening at breathtaking speed.\\n\\nAt times, the administration takes a kernel of truth and then distorts it wildly. At others, it’s entirely unclear where the theories are coming from. Here are four examples of this government by conspiracy theory:\\n\\n1) No, USAID didn’t secretly bribe media outlets for pro-Democratic coverage\\n\\nMusk has targeted both Politico and Reuters as news organizations, posting screenshots from a database of government payments and falsely claiming that their newsrooms received millions in federal grants. The Trump administration has cited those payments as examples of government waste and evidence that the federal government is supporting anti-Trump media.\\n\\nIn actuality, the federal government as a whole paid millions for employee subscriptions to Politico Pro, which offers “specialist reporting, data analysis, and expert briefings covering 22 policy areas” for an audience including industry stakeholders and government officials. These aren’t grants, but instead are purchases of subscriptions.\\n\\nBut baseless speculation that Politico received and depended on government grants grew online after the company missed payroll due to an unrelated technical issue. Within days, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, “LOOKS LIKE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE BEEN STOLLEN [sic] AT USAID, AND OTHER AGENCIES, MUCH OF IT GOING TO THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA AS A ‘PAYOFF’ FOR CREATING GOOD STORIES ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS.”\\n\\nMusk has also claimed that Reuters received millions of dollars from the US government to undertake a “large-scale social deception” campaign, calling the news organization a “total scam.” What he failed to mention, however, was that the data analytics arm of Reuters, not its news division, received those funds starting under the first Trump administration to investigate defenses to such campaigns.\\n\\nSince then, the Trump administration has ordered many government agencies to cancel their subscriptions to news organizations, including The Economist, the New York Times, Politico, Bloomberg News, the Associated Press, and Reuters. The State Department, for example, recently issued a memo ordering the cancellation of subscriptions to “non-mission critical” publications that are “not academic or professional journals.”\\n\\n2) FEMA didn’t blow millions on luxury hotels for migrants\\n\\nEarlier this month, Musk posted on his social platform X that his team at DOGE had discovered that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had “sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants.”\\n\\nIt’s not clear exactly what he was referencing, and he did not provide any evidence of such payments.\\n\\nHe could be referring to funds paid out via the Shelter and Services Program, which is approved by Congress and administered by FEMA to support migrants released in the US after being apprehended at the southern border.\\n\\nThe New York City mayor’s office told the Associated Press that, during the time period Musk referenced, it had received $19 million in direct hotel costs as part of that program. While the city is currently sheltering 46,000 migrants, including some in hotels, it has never paid luxury rates and most were put up in hotels outside Manhattan, the Associated Press reported. On average, it has paid $152 per night, while five-star accommodations are typically more than double that price.\\n\\nOn February 11, the administration clawed back $80 million in grants to New York City, apparently the first time that Trump has revoked congressionally approved funds from a local government. On Friday, the city filed a lawsuit in an attempt to get the money back.\\n\\nThe Trump administration “took these funds from the City without any advance notice that it would be doing so and without communicating any decision or rationale to the City,” according to the lawsuit.\\n\\n3) RFK Jr. is doubling down on conspiracy theories about childhood vaccines\\n\\nRecently confirmed as health secretary, Kennedy has been one of the leading voices of the anti-vaccine movement. He’s pushed disinformation about vaccines since 2005, when he falsely claimed that some childhood vaccines had dangerous levels of mercury that could cause autism, despite the fact scientists had already proven that mercury levels in those vaccines were not harmful and did not lead to autism.\\n\\nDuring his confirmation hearings, he reportedly privately promised Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), a doctor and longtime advocate for vaccination, that he would not change existing vaccine recommendations. That helped him secure a pivotal vote from Cassidy, who said he would speak with Kennedy several times a month to collaborate on health policy.\\n\\nHowever, Kennedy is now taking steps to link vaccines to chronic diseases — a potential precursor to an anti-vaccine policy. He announced that he is using a newly created panel to investigate childhood vaccines for measles, polio, and other diseases for connections to other chronic diseases.\\n\\n“Nothing is going to be off limits,” Kennedy said in his first remarks at the agency.\\n\\nKennedy has also been critical of a government panel of vaccine experts that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The so-called Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was supposed to meet this month for the first time since Kennedy was confirmed, but the meeting has been postponed, and the committee itself is facing review under one of Trump’s recent executive orders.\\n\\n4) Trump’s offer of asylum to South Africa’s white minority is based on conspiracy theory\\n\\nTrump issued an executive order earlier this month cutting off US aid to South Africa and granting asylum to the country’s white minority, claiming that their government is discriminating against them. The executive order cites a recently enacted land reform bill, which it claims allows the seizure of “ethnic minority Afrikaners’ agricultural property without compensation” and is “fueling disproportionate violence against racially disfavored landowners.”\\n\\nIn actuality, the law allows the South African government to seize privately owned land in limited circumstances, such as when property is abandoned, for public use, and typically requires “just and equitable” compensation.\\n\\nAbout 70 percent of that land is still owned by white people, who make up about 7 percent of the South African population, decades after the end of the Afrikaner-controlled government’s system of apartheid. There is no evidence that white farmers have been victims of disproportionate, racially motivated violence.\\n\\nBut Trump’s rhetoric about it echoes that of the influential Afrikaner rights group AfriForum, which has been pushing such conspiracy theories for years. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights organization, has referred to AfriForum’s leaders as white supremacists.\\n\\nMusk, a native South African, has also decried what he describes as a “genocide” against white farmers.'},\n",

The two presidents, who have spent years bitterly criticizing each other, shared a limo on the way to the Capitol.\\n\\nREAD MORE: How move-in day will work when the Trumps return to the White House\\n\\nTrump’s inauguration realized a political comeback without precedent in American history. Four years ago, he was voted out of the White House during an economic collapse caused by the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. Trump denied his defeat and tried to cling to power. He directed his supporters to march on the Capitol while lawmakers were certifying the election results, sparking a riot that interrupted the country’s tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\\n\\nBut Trump never lost his grip on the Republican Party and was undeterred by criminal cases and two assassination attempts as he steamrolled rivals and harnessed voters’ exasperation with inflation and illegal immigration.\\n\\nWATCH: Leaders in tech, AI and cryptocurrency make big donations to Trump inauguration\\n\\n“I am ready for a new United States,” said Cynde Bost, 63, from Lake Havasu City, Arizona.\\n\\nTrump, in his inaugural address, acknowledged that he was taking office on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which honors the slain civil rights hero. Trump said, “We will strive together to make his dream a reality,” and he thanked Black and Latino voters for their support in November.\\n\\nLIVE BLOG: Fact-checking Trump’s 2nd inauguration\\n\\nNow Trump is the first person convicted of a felony — for falsifying business records related to hush money payments — to serve as president. He pledged to “preserve, protect and defend” the Constitution from the same spot that was overrun by his supporters on Jan. 6, 2021. He’s said that one of his first acts in office will be to pardon many of those who participated in the riot.\\n\\nEight years after he first entered the White House as a political newcomer, Trump is far more familiar with the operations of federal government and emboldened to bend it to his vision. Trump wants to bring quick change by curtailing immigration, enacting tariffs on imports and rolling back Democrats’ climate and social initiatives.\\n\\nHe has also promised retribution against his political opponents and critics, and placed personal loyalty as a prime qualification for appointments to his administration.\\n\\nWith minutes to go before leaving office, Biden issued preemptive pardons to his siblings and their spouses to shield them from the possibility of prosecution. He said in a statement that his family “has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats” and that he has “no reason to believe these attacks will end.”\\n\\nEarlier in the day, Biden took a similar step with current and former government officials who have been the target of Trump’s anger. Biden said “these are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing.”\\n\\nTrump has pledged to go further and move faster in enacting his agenda than during his first term, and already the country’s political, business and technology leaders have realigned themselves to accommodate Trump.\\n\\nDemocrats who once formed a “resistance” are now divided over whether to work with Trump or defy him. Billionaires have lined up to meet with Trump as they acknowledge his unrivaled power in Washington and his ability to wield the levers of government to help or hurt their interests.\\n\\nLong skeptical of American alliances, Trump’s “America First” foreign policy is being watched warily at home and abroad as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will soon enter its third year, and a fragile ceasefire appears to be holding in Gaza after more than 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas.\\n\\nAlso present will be the head of TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned social media app deemed a national security risk by the U.S. Trump has promised to lift an effective ban on TikTok through one of many executive orders expected to be issued on Monday as the new president attempts to show quick progress.\\n\\nTrump is planning to swiftly reinstitute his 2020 playbook to crackdown on the southern border — again declaring a national emergency, limiting the number of refugees entering the U.S. and deploying the military. He’s expected to take additional actions — including constitutionally questionable ones — such as attempting to end birthright citizenship automatically bestowed on people born in the U.S.\\n\\nTrump will also sign an executive order aimed at ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the federal government. The order will direct federal agencies to coordinate with the White House on identifying and terminating DEI programs. Conservatives have long criticized programs that give preference based on race, gender and sexual orientation, arguing they violate the Constitution.\\n\\nOthers orders are expected to allow more oil and gas drilling by rolling back Biden-era policies on domestic energy production and rescind Biden’s recent directive on artificial intelligence.\\n\\nMore changes are planned for the federal workforce. Trump wants to unwind diversity, equity and inclusion programs known as DEI, require employees to come back to the office and lay the groundwork to reduce staff.\\n\\nWith control of Congress, Republicans are also working alongside the incoming administration on legislation that will further roll back Biden’s policies and institute their own priorities.\\n\\n— Zeke Miller, Chris Megerian and Michelle L.

       "   'content': 'WASHINGTON (AP) — Conservatives from across the country filled a ballroom a few blocks from the White House and lamented that the United States is abandoning the ideals that forged a great nation. Some attendees donned red hats with various inscriptions mocking President Donald Trump and his “Make America Great Again” movement.\\n\\nIt was the largest gathering to date of the “Principles First Summit,” expanded upon Trump’s second term to welcome independents and center-left Democrats under a shared pro-democracy, anti-authoritarian aim.\\n\\n“This is not a time to bend the knee, to play along,” said Heath Mayo, the Yale-educated attorney who founded Principles First five years ago for self-identified politically homeless conservatives. “This is a time for stiffening your spine, standing up and getting ready for a long fight.”\\n\\nYet three days of conversations and recriminations still left 1,200 attendees without a clear roadmap to loosen Trump’s grip on the conservative movement and America’s national identity. There was not even consensus on whether to fight within Republican spheres at all, migrate to the Democratic Party or find a different path altogether.\\n\\n“It makes you feel better to know that you’re not alone and that you’re not crazy,” said Jeff Oppenheim, a retired U.S. Army colonel from Austin, Texas. “The question is how to translate that into action in a political system that’s very difficult to influence, because it’s structured in a way that two parties have complete control.”\\n\\nMark Cuban, the entrepreneur and “Shark Tank” co-host who was one of then-Vice President Kamala Harris’ most prominent surrogates last fall, got a rousing ovation when he took the stage but vowed that he would not run for the White House. He dismissed the Democratic Party, profanely, as unable to sell its own message.\\n\\n“I’m not here to throw him under the bus,” Cuban said of Trump, praising the Republican president’s ability as a marketer who convinced voters he could help them.\\n\\nDemocrats, Cuban said, make their critiques of Trump moot because they “can’t sell worth s—.”\\n\\nTrump’s allies mocked the gathering in advance as full of “RINOs,” or Republicans in name only. White House communications director Steven Cheung called it “the Cuck Convention” on his government account. The word “cuck,” which describes a man who likes to watch his wife have sex with other men, was frequently used during the campaign to insult and emasculate rivals.\\n\\nTrump has far greater control of the Republican Party in his second term, with allies across Congress and the loyalty of most of the party’s base. But his few remaining rivals within the party argue there are still ways to break his hold.\\n\\nFormer U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a frequent Trump target who was among the people to receive a preemptive pardon from President Joe Biden, pointed to Republicans’ narrow 218-215 majority in the House and said lawmakers are privately nervous as recent town halls show voter anger over billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk and his sweeping moves to fire federal workers, shut down agencies and limit federal services.\\n\\nKinzinger urged critics to ratchet up pressure in public settings because critical town hall audiences, he argued, offer the most “uncomfortable” moments of a politician’s job.\\n\\nREAD MORE: Groups call on veterans to protest Trump administration’s ‘intentional betrayal’ of Afghans who helped U.S. forces\\n\\n“Right now, Republican members of Congress fear one person: Donald Trump. They don’t fear you,” Kinzinger said. “When they start fearing you, that’s when they start having a different calculus.”\\n\\nJulie Spilsbury, a councilmember from Mesa, Arizona, wants to maintain her place in Republican ranks. Like more than two dozen attendees and speakers interviewed by The Associated Press, Spilsbury cast her 2024 ballot for Harris for president. But she also publicly endorsed the Democratic nominee, saying it was a matter of “character and integrity.”\\n\\nShe now faces an ongoing recall effort by Trump backers in Mesa.\\n\\n“If you’re looking for something you can do, send me $10” for her retention campaign, Spilsbury told fellow conference attendees.\\n\\nWhen Asa Hutchinson, the former Arkansas governor who ran in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, and Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a centrist Democrat, offered carefully measured assessments of Trump’s opening weeks, they got mixed or muted responses. Especially tepid was the reaction when Hutchinson said he believes Trump when the president says he will respect court decisions in the many early challenges to his executive actions.\\n\\nBut roars rang out for the police officers who tried to protect the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and their unyielding assessments of Trump and his pardon of 1,500 supporters who breached the seat of Congress, including many who violently attacked law enforcement.\\n\\n“We need to hold on to the outrage and hold on to the anger and set aside the fear,” insisted Michael Fanone, a former Washington officer who was attacked by rioters. Asked whether he would accept an invitation to talk to Trump, Fanone said the president is incapable of being convinced he is wrong and dismissed him with a profanity.\\n\\nFanone and his fellow officers later were accosted in an upstairs lobby by Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, freshly freed from prison by Trump’s pardon. The following day, Principles First leaders received an emailed bomb threat specifically mentioning Fanone, his mother’s address and other potential targets. The summit space was evacuated as Washington police and Secret Service agents swept the area and found no bomb, allowing the conference to conclude Sunday evening. Organizers blamed the threat on Tarrio, who denied the claim in a post on his social media.\\n\\nMaria Stephan, a progressive at her first Principles First gathering, called the evacuation “emboldening” given the weekend’s themes.\\n\\nYet Rich Logis of Broward County, Florida, offered caution as a former MAGA acolyte whose red hat now reads: “I LEFT MAGA.” Another wave of converts, Logis argued, is coming if Trump continues to impose tariffs, cut public services and impose policies that hurt Americans broadly.\\n\\n“Everyone has to find their own breaking point,” Logis said. “Our job is to be there talking to people as they find it.”'},\n",

       "   'content': 'WASHINGTON, D. C.\\n\\nAUGUST 26, 2023\\n\\nCan’t tell you what Martin Luther King Jr. was doing in the hours, minutes, before he delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech, but I can tell you that sixty years later, Alfred Charles Sharpton Jr. is sitting in an upholstered wooden chair in his trailer, parked on a fence line behind the Lincoln Memorial, fielding calls on his cell phone about today’s rally, at which he will deliver his own speech. Can’t tell you the logistical concerns MLK solved himself in the minutes before he gave his most famous public address, but I can tell you that Sharpton’s cell is ring ring ringing with handlers and schedulers panicked about the lineup, about having the event shut down by the National Park Service for the bureaucratic alibi that it has run past its permitted time.\\n\\nOn the umpteenth such call, Sharpton, who’s about as calm as an August breeze, tells the anxious messenger to get ahold of Stephen K. Benjamin, a senior advisor to President Biden, and have him handle it.\\n\\nThere were 250,000 people at the original March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. But today’s continuation—that’s what he’s calling it, a continuation, not a commemoration—appears not to reach the 75,000 estimated by Sharpton and Martin Luther King III, two of its chief organizers. Still, King is present with his wife and their daughter, MLK’s only grandchild. And Sharpton? Coretta Scott King herself once described him as a leader “in the spirit and tradition of Martin Luther King Jr.” Nonetheless, over his long career as a rabble-rouser, there have been no few folks naysaying how well he has bent the moral arc of the universe toward justice, who’ve questioned whether he’s deserving of inclusion on the esteemed short list of civil-rights icons.\\n\\nAndre D. Wagner Sharpton outside the National Action Network in Harlem. Deep into a long career as a civil-rights leader—mentored by some of its most revered figures, though controversial himself—he is now the movement’s elder statesman. Photographed in Harlem, December 2023.\\n\\nThe trailer has a kitchen, bottled waters and half-dirty dishes scattered across its countertop. A dining table holds Sharpton’s briefcase and a bottle of his trusty Cool Mint Listerine—he swishes it as a habit to preserve his voice, which is tinged with natural rasp. Against a wall of fake bricks: one of the world’s tiniest flat-screen TVs and a gas fireplace. Sharpton wears a blue three-piece suit with a blue-and-white-striped tie, a uniform of empowered men from a certain era, of his era—the man is sixty-nine years old. He wears black oxfords that have the comfortable soles of sneakers, and the shoes aren’t new, proven by the white threads peeking around their top lines.\\n\\nSharpton’s cell keeps right on ringing.\\n\\nAmid the fusillade of frantic calls, one turns out to be not from a worried handler but from the Reverend Jesse Jackson.\\n\\nHe who was here to witness (up close) the original “I Have a Dream” sixty years ago, he who made two serious runs for the presidency of the United States, he who is an incontrovertible civil-rights titan.\\n\\n“Reverend,” Sharpton says, a warm smile in his voice.\\n\\nJackson responds, but Sharpton—whom most people call Rev and diehards proclaim is the president of Black America—can’t hear him, so he puts the call on speaker.\\n\\n“I’ll come see you, Reverend,” Sharpton says.\\n\\nJackson’s health has been deteriorating, and he sounds to my ear unintelligible. But Sharpton, who speaks to his mentor on the regular, deciphers it.\\n\\nAndre D Wagner Sharpton outside the National Action Network in Harlem. December 2023.\\n\\nWhat are the chances it would be Jackson calling right now? Jackson, who worked side by side with MLK. Jackson, who met Sharpton when he was a teen and helped nurture him into a leader. Jackson’s garbled voice in this trailer is a bridge to a long-gone past, from MLK’s admired activism to Sharpton’s much-criticized methods.\\n\\n“Don’t worry about that,” Sharpton is saying to Jackson. “I’m going out there. I’m speaking for you. . . . You trained me to do it, and I’m gon’ do it. Don’t worry about it, Reverend. I’ll call you soon as it’s over.”\\n\\nSharpton hangs up his phone and says, “That was an omen.”\\n\\nSOUTH CAROLINA\\n\\nTHREE WEEKS EARLIER\\n\\nThere may be no greater marker of evolution than the posterity of the once enslaved traveling by private jet to visit an old plantation. Sharpton has chartered one to see the South Carolina property on which his forebears worked as chattel.\\n\\nThe entourage includes about a dozen folks, counting Sharpton’s security detail, his personal photographer, and members of his communications team. The most meaningful travelers today are his daughters—Ashley, thirty-six, and Dominique, thirty-seven—who, because neither has visited, were the motivation for the trip.\\n\\nA small delegation—local historians, folks whose ancestors were enslaved with Sharpton’s—receives him at an airport in South Carolina. We caravan in black SUVs (Sharpton doesn’t drive) to what used to be a plantation called Cactus Hedge. In 2007, Sharpton learned from a genealogist that his great-grandfather Coleman Sharpton Sr. was enslaved by pre–Civil War plantation owner Alexander Sharpton—a man who once owned more than four thousand acres of farmland and enslaved seventy-eight people—and that Alexander purchased Coleman for $276 in 1839. Sharpton also discovered that his great-grandfather was later enslaved by a relative of Strom Thurmond, the longtime South Carolina senator and staunch segregationist.\\n\\nOld trucks, rusted to the color of clay, squat in a field. A fence of chicken wire surrounds the main house. You can hear chickens clucking, a pen of turkeys gobbling and yelping, see goats wandering. There’s a pit of rocks and twigs for a bonfire. The man who now owns the property, Phillip White, tells Sharpton that he bought it because he loved it, and it was cheap. (He says he paid $50,000 for the house and ten acres in 1983.)\\n\\nWhite is squat, with a neck that doesn’t move much. He tours us through his two-story main house, large for its time at around two thousand square feet. He acknowledges the children’s toys scattered about the living room. He points out the breezeway, explains how the house stays cool because of the gaps in the wood flooring. He points to the thickness of the beams running across the ceiling and brags that they were hewn from heart pine. He shares that he didn’t know the history of the house when he bought it but that it was perfect, “just like it was a hundred years ago.”\\n\\nNo one reminds White that the idyllic life of a hundred years yore was smack in the crush of Jim Crow, an era when Sharpton or me could’ve been lynched for looking him in the eye or refusing to kowtow off his side of the street.\\n\\nWhite tours us across a large field, a Kangal Shepherd dog the size of a dinosaur (150 pounds if he’s an ounce) that White swears is harmless bounding alongside us, to a shack that would’ve housed Sharpton’s great- grandfather and many others enslaved on the plantation. The shack, which is the size of a two-car garage, is made of rotting wood and has a rusted tin roof and a chimney of rock and mud. Sharpton stands in the doorway.\\n\\n“This is where they would have to eat.” A question and statement in one.\\n\\nAndre D Wagner For all his old bluster, Sharpton has stayed true to MLK’s tenet of nonviolence. Photographed in Harlem, December 2023\\n\\n“Exactly,” says White. Sharpton calls his daughters over, and they all stand near the front door, gazing around the room. They take a photo at the threshold. It’s a striking photo. There’s no way to ignore the sorrow in their eyes.\\n\\nWhite explains more about the daily life of the Black people who lived on the plantation. “They had cows, beef. They had a big garden. So they ate good when they lived here,” he says, sounding earnest.\\n\\n“But they were slaves,” Sharpton shoots back.\\n\\nThe enslaved were not given headstones, but there’s a strong chance that some of Sharpton’s relatives are buried in unmarked graves beneath a nearby gravel area.\\n\\nSoon we’re trundling along Sharpton Road on the way to the cemetery where Sharptons are buried—white Sharptons. Al Sharpton is ensconced in the SUV again, a soft briefcase stitched with the insignia of the National Action Network (NAN), his organization, beside him; his cologne, Al Haramain’s Amber Oud, fragranting the cabin. He wears a silver Rolex and a diamond insignia ring with his initials. Up close, his hands are a shade or two lighter than his face. He keeps his nails trimmed short.\\n\\nSharpton, Ashley, and Dominique stroll the Bermuda grass between the headstones to a row where Alexander and Adeline Bussey Sharpton lie. Sharpton holds his phone in one hand and keeps his jacket buttoned. He and his daughters look over more headstones, some of which are large and dressed with fresh plants and bouquets, some of which belong to Thurmonds.\\n\\nIt is one thing to be Black and know that, generations ago, white people owned your forebears. It is quite another to be standing at the foot of the gravestones of those white people and their posterity and considering that the surname that’s become a crucial part of who you are is theirs. And that’s the feeling I see wash over Ashley and Dominique.\\n\\nOn the private flight back, the captain offers snacks, which Sharpton declines. His ascetic diet consists of one meal a day: kale salad, boiled eggs, tomatoes, and cucumbers. Sometimes he has a green juice in the morning. Sometimes he snacks on a piece of dry toast. Matterfact, over the two-plus months I spend with him, I don’t see the man eat a single meal. This version of Sharpton is svelte, polished, measured, wears bespoke suits and has the bearing of a statesman.\\n\\nHARLEM\\n\\nJUNE 10, 2023\\n\\nEvery Saturday, clockwork, Sharpton can be found at the Harlem headquarters of NAN—a building long ago christened the House of Justice by Jesse Jackson—holding his Saturday Action Rally. There’s not much difference between the House of Justice and a storefront church, right down to its location smack between a Kennedy Chicken & Biscuit and a bodega, to the graffiti tagging its weathered facade, to the speaker just above the threshold blasting the goings-on inside.\\n\\nThere ain’t much difference, either, between the “rally” and who you’d find at an eclectic nondenominational Black church service. A little girl in a white dress holding a NAN fan. A guy in the front row shooting the happenings on a pair of cell phones, one in each hand. A woman wearing a gay-pride sash—she was at the Stonewall riots in 1969—dark sunglasses, and a tiara. All of them sitting in padded interlocked chairs, save a man capping an aisle in a wheelchair. Along one wall, a three-piece band (drums, guitar, keyboard) plays stirring gospel. The choir sings in front of the pulpit, a low wooden platform with a simple branded podium.\\n\\nThose blue walls of the House of Justice are a gallery. Above the band, there’s a giant framed photo of Sharpton with James Brown, maybe the most important man in his life. There are photos of Sharpton with President Barack Obama, with President Biden, with former attorney general Eric Holder. Him consoling the mother of Sean Bell, shot to death by the NYPD on his wedding day in 2006. There are framed clippings of Sharpton from The New York Times, the Amsterdam News, the New York Daily News. The cover of Newsweek. A blown-up version of him on the cover of Ebony.\\n\\nDominique, as well as Sharpton’s ex-wife (and the mother of his daughters) Kathy Jordan, joins the choir to sing “Never Give Up,” which rouses the room to its feet. During a long pause in the song, Sharpton strolls out wearing a dark-gray suit, a striped tie, and black dress shoes. He takes the lectern and gazes at the room.\\n\\n“No justice,” says Sharpton.\\n\\n“No peace,” says the audience.\\n\\n“No justice,” says Sharpton.\\n\\n“No peace,” says the audience.\\n\\n“No justice.”\\n\\n“No peace.”\\n\\n“What do we want?”\\n\\n“Justice!” shouts the audience.\\n\\n“What do we want?”\\n\\n“Justice!”\\n\\n“When do we want it?”\\n\\n“Now!”\\n\\n“Fist-bump the person next to you and tell them you love them,” he says.\\n\\nSharpton begins his sermon by discussing the history of civil rights, half- joking about fly-by-night protesters who say, “I ain’t gon’ take no more”—and then at the next incident can’t be found. The crowd laughs. “I want young folk that will be here for the long haul,” Sharpton says, “that understand that this is not a seasonal struggle. And the reason I know that is that I was raised by those who understand this was going to be a long struggle. I was young, wild, crazy, and mad as anybody else. I understand all that. But after a while you understand that you got to deal with pacing yourself for the long haul.”\\n\\nThe rally will include a red-pantsuited, red-wigged, red-lipsticked woman praise-dancing in bare feet. The “NAN Freedom Runner,” a dude in an orange T-shirt and dark aviator sunglasses, dashing laps around the floor to people cheering, “Run, Jesse, run! Run for our freedom!” Will include Sharpton standing on the edge of the platform to collect tithes and calling both the name of the person and the amount of their offering. “All right, I need some fifties, fifties, fifties, come on,” he goads, after the first few hundred- dollar-or-better donations.\\n\\nAndre D Wagner Every week, Sharpton conducts his Saturday Action Rally at the National Action Network, which Jesse Jackson dubbed the House of Justice.\\n\\nThese people, most of whom must be as distant from the citadels as one gets, are Sharpton’s flock, the core of his constituency, too, the ones he can call up and, quick-fast, get them raising signs and shouting outside a building or somebody’s home.\\n\\nIn the 1980s and ’90s, Sharpton was a fried-chicken-gorging behemoth of a man seen all around New York in a tracksuit, a medallion, a bouffant conk, and big muttonchops as he bullhorned protestations of racism and bigotry and injustice using a helluva lot of language MLK wouldn’t have dared utter in public—the n-word, cracker, “Uncle Tom,” analogizing a New York attorney general to Hitler.\\n\\nIn his time as a national figure, he’s been exposed as an FBI informant (“In my own mind I was not an informant; I was cooperating with investigations,” he told reporters), been reported by The New York Times to owe millions in personal and business taxes combined (he called the story “misleading”), pleaded guilty to failing to file a state personal income tax return, been alleged to have been several months in arrears on rent. He was indicted (and acquitted) on sixty-seven counts of fraud and larceny. Indicted for (and acquitted of) stealing $250,000 from an organization he founded. He’s been labeled the Minister of Hate, a “practitioner of the big lie,” and a “race racketeer.” Been called an ambulance chaser, a loudmouth, a walking sound bite, a media hound, a charlatan, a buffoon, a fake . . . damn near everything but, as we say, a child of God.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnly he was a child of God, and a precocious one at that.\\n\\nAndre D Wagner Congregants gather to hear Sharpton preach, to sing, to worship.\\n\\nEven before he attended kindergarten, Sharpton preached for his church, sermonizing on the Gospel of John from a soapbox placed in front of his church steps because he was too small to be seen in the pulpit. He was four. By the time he was seven, he’d been christened the Wonderboy in Black church circles. Sharpton’s mother steered her wondrous son into the mentorship of Bishop F. D. Washington, who began taking Sharpton all around the country to preach. Sharpton sought out Adam Clayton Powell Jr. on his own accord, and one of the most powerful Black men in America at the time became his earliest political mentor.\\n\\nWorried he’d abandon the church for political activism, Sharpton’s mother shepherded him to the Reverend Dr. William Jones, who made Sharpton the youth director of the New York chapter of Operation Breadbasket, the economic arm of MLK’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Sharpton soon met the national director of Operation Breadbasket: the young, hip Reverend Jesse Jackson.\\n\\nPowell, Jones, and Jackson helped mold Sharpton from the Wonderboy preacher into a wunderkind activist, a boy who founded his first civil-rights organization, the National Youth Movement (NYM), with money he’d received from MLK’s former close advisor, Bayard Rustin.\\n\\nSharpton was just eighteen, in 1973, when he met James Brown, whose son had attended NYM meetings. Brown’s son died in a car accident, and to honor him, Brown reached out to Sharpton and performed a fundraising concert for the NYM. Before long, Brown and Sharpton’s relationship deepened. Sharpton married one of Brown’s former backup singers, Kathy Jordan, and they had Dominique and Ashley.\\n\\nSharpton spent the eighties marching, agitating, protesting. Building relationships with sundry figures: Don King, Michael Jackson, and Donald Trump, a man he now describes as a “polished bigot.” In 1984, Bernhard Goetz, a white man, shot four Black teenagers on the subway (he claimed he was afraid they were going to mug him), and Sharpton’s activism played a role in Goetz’s being convicted of illegal possession of a firearm.\\n\\nAndre D Wagner These are Sharpton’s people, the ones he can call upon to join him at protests, at rallies, at funerals.\\n\\nSharpton’s breakthrough happened two years after the shooting. Three Black men had been beaten in Howard Beach, Queens—and one of them, in trying to escape, ran onto the Belt Parkway and was hit by a car and killed. Howard Beach was the first time Sharpton took his protest to a white neighborhood, a tactic that disabused more people of the lie that virulent racism was less of an issue in New York. Three of the white attackers were convicted of second-degree manslaughter. Sharpton, with a showman’s knack for hyperbole, later proclaimed it “the first public awakening of northern racism.”\\n\\nDuring the trial for Howard Beach, in 1987, Sharpton became involved in the case of Tawana Brawley, a fifteen-year-old girl who told a disturbing story about being abducted and raped multiple times by six white men, including a cop and an assistant DA. Sharpton and her lawyers alleged a cover-up and discouraged Brawley from testifying. But after several months, testimony that amounted to six thousand pages, and 180 witnesses, a grand jury ruled her claim false.\\n\\nSharpton didn’t concede. Not after the verdict. Not after Brawley’s ex-boyfriend claimed she’d invented the story to avoid being beaten for running away. Not after he lost a defamation case. (A group of his supporters paid $65,000 in damages to the former assistant DA.) Not in the almost forty intervening years.\\n\\n“I believed a young lady and her mother and two lawyers, a risk that I took in the thirty-something years since then,” he tells me. “How do I know that they weren’t going to come with something on George Floyd? How did I know they wasn’t going to come with something on Trayvon? And if the hardest knock they can give me in my career is that I believed a little girl whose mother told her story and two lawyers told me it was right . . . I’ll take that. I’ll take that.”\\n\\nBut Brawley remains a major blemish on his career, one that provokes fair questions: Why did he go so hard for her? Was he chasing notoriety at the expense of truth? Isn’t believing a possible but somewhat specious story in a charged moment different from remaining adamant after overwhelming evidence and the benefit of hindsight? Why hasn’t he expressed serious contrition? Is it ego holding him back? Hubris? Isn’t there wisdom, kindness, grace in offering an apology?\\n\\nAndre D Wagner The Saturday Action Rally in full swing.\\n\\nWhatever you think about Sharpton’s handling of the Brawley case, though, consider how often a man in his position has had to believe in what sounded impossible. Consider the truth that he’s spent his adult life fighting injustice, too often at the hands of law enforcement. Consider the childhood trauma of his father deserting the family when he was ten, plunging him, his sister, and their mother into poverty and forging Sharpton into his mother’s fierce protector. Consider the cultural imperative for Black men to protect our women, so much so that it was once the namesake of proposed legislation. Consider that Sharpton was a brand-new father at the time, that he would return home to Ashley as an infant and Dominique not long out of infancy.\\n\\nHowever much you disapprove of Sharpton’s defiance in the Brawley ordeal, weigh it against his evolution since then.\\n\\nBegin, maybe, with this watershed, in 1991: Sharpton was stabbed while preparing to protest the murder of Yusuf Hawkins, a Black teen who’d been attacked, shot, and killed by a white mob in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. “There’s still too much racism in the country,” he told Jesse Jackson from his hospital bed. “And if I survive, I hope I’m going to be even more serious now in the true King tradition of opposing it.”\\n\\nSharpton ran for U. S. Senate in 1992 and 1994. He ran for mayor of New York City in 1997. He ran for president in 2004. He lost all those elections, which wasn’t no big old surprise to him nor anybody, really. But he won a preponderance of the Black vote and nearly 15 percent of all Democratic primary votes cast (166,000 out of 1.2 million) in his 1992 bid and more than 25 percent (178,000 out of 700,000) in 1994—all achieved with budgets of $100,000 or less both times—and quantified himself as a legitimate political force.\\n\\nAndre D Wagner Sharpton at the pulpit.\\n\\nSharpton, for all his old bluster, has remained true to MLK’s central tenet of nonviolence. He’s become a popular TV pundit and radio host. He might well be the most esteemed eulogist in Black America. He helped organize a rally in support of George Floyd during the pandemic that he estimates at two hundred thousand—the accomplishment that makes him most proud.\\n\\nWhat if Sharpton’s ultimate legacy is not some omnibus writ that the ill- intentioned—looking at you, SCOTUS—will work lifetimes to dismantle but his indefatigable insistence (he logs a staggering 250,000 to 300,000 air miles per year) on the overtruth that there never has been nor will be a post-racial America, least of all in the city that is its locus of power. It’s not the bright, tangible achievements of his forebears but the difficult, often fallible work of steadying a light that won’t let you look away.\\n\\nMOUNT VERNON, NEW YORK\\n\\nJUNE 11, 2023\\n\\nSharpton has agreed to fill in for the pastor of Greater Centennial AME Zion Church in Mount Vernon, New York, and arrives preacher clean in a gray suit, a light-blue French-cuff shirt, links, his trusty NAN lapel pin. Before the sermon, he hosts his radio show, Sunday Morning with Rev. Al Sharpton, in a small conference room. The second he signs off, Sharpton turns to the Reverend Malcolm J. Byrd, a protégé, and says, “Bible.” Sharpton spends a few minutes, tops, looking over pages. “Okay, ready,” he says.\\n\\nHe sits in a velvet chair in an elevated pulpit, nodding to the mellifluous sound of the choir behind him. Reverend Byrd introduces him as the finest preacher “south of heaven and north of hell” and “a spokesperson of truth and liberation of the first magnitude,” what seems an impossible promise.\\n\\nSharpton preaches a sermon that ends with a story about letting a white reporter accompany him to church while profiling him. He says the reporter asked him about a woman in the congregation who kept leaning over in the pews like she was going to fall, then snapping straight. “Oh, you don’t know that lady’s story,” Sharpton says, switching to the drawn-out delivery of a southern whooping preacher. “That woman brought herself up from the South. She got married. Her and her husband had a little construction company. They did well and moved out to a middle-class section of Queens, New York. Used to buy a Cadillac every year. One day she woke up and her husband had walked out with her daughter from an earlier marriage. Had a child with his stepdaughter. Abandoned her and her little boy and her little girl. She ended up watching them come and take the Cadillac back. She tried to keep the bills going, but they turned the lights and gas off. She couldn’t pay the utilities. Finally, she couldn’t keep the house any longer. She had to move into the heart of the ghetto. She got on welfare and got food stamps. Did side jobs as a domestic worker. Her little boy would walk her to the subway to go downtown to scrub floors. And she would tell him, ‘Don’t worry about nothing. God will make a way. I don’t know where. I don’t know how. But God will make a way somehow.’ And she lived to see that little girl and that little boy grow up to be somebody. And when she thinks about how she lost everything but God brought her through anyhow and brought her children through, her little girl and her little boy through, she jumps up out her seat, leans to the side, and just jumps up and down,” Sharpton says, and mimics the motion.\\n\\n“And the reason I know her story is because I’m her little boy,” he says, and in one of the sublimities of the Black church, the organist stresses his pause as if it’d been rehearsed. “He walks with me,” he shouts, to more organ accompaniment. “He talks with me. He tells me that I’m his own. God will. God will. God will. Make a way.” Sharpton wings his arms and points to the front row. “Yes, he will. Yes, he will!” he says, and steps away from the mic.\\n\\nNo “thank you,” no pause to relish applause, just an abrupt turn from the lectern. His hallmark.\\n\\nSHARPTON HOME\\n\\nJUNE 11, 2023\\n\\nSharpton answers the door to his apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan wearing a dress shirt, unbuttoned at the throat but tucked into his slacks, and slides with socked feet. Per public records, NAN paid Sharpton just shy of $650,000 in compensation as its CEO and president in 2021, plus spent almost $1 million more on private jets and car service. That income, combined with his salary from MSNBC—his talk show, PoliticsNation, often boasts the highest concentration of Black viewers on cable news—radio gigs, and speaking fees, places Sharpton in the top 1 percent of American earners.\\n\\nAndre D Wagner Sharpton travels the country attending funerals and rallies, leading protests.\\n\\nHe leads me outside to show me the view from his wraparound balcony, a remarkable sight, which is furnished with a small couch and a low table. He tours me past the office of his partner, forty-five-year-old fashion designer Aisha McShaw, with whom he made his relationship public in 2013.\\n\\nSharpton’s home office is like another vault of his archives. Above the desk hangs an old program, the kind some churches give out, advertising “The Rev. Alfred Sharpton Jr. A dynamic 7-year-old minister.” There’s a picture of Sharpton with his father, both dressed in church robes. A picture of his first grandson alongside his older daughter and the boy’s father. A picture of Sharpton holding his grandson, the boy decked out in a paperboy hat and with his fist in Sharpton’s mouth. A picture of him with James Brown, back when Sharpton had an Afro, both smiling and raising a Black-power fist. A picture from 1971, when he participated in a sit-in at an A&P. A picture of him on Saturday Night Live. There’s a stack of headbands just above his desk.\\n\\nAt his dining-room table, the sound of his TV playing an MSNBC show in the background, Sharpton tells me about the men who shaped him.\\n\\nThere would be no Reverend Al Sharpton without Bishop Frederick Douglas Washington, who was not only one of the most well-regarded Pentecostal preachers in the country but the pastor of Sharpton’s childhood church. Bishop Washington, a former boyhood preacher himself, allowed Sharpton to preach in public for the first time—July 9, 1959—and thereafter became his first mentor, someone who encouraged him to preach once a month and modeled the reading practice of a philomath. See the influence of Bishop Washington’s preaching style—it ranged from sound homiletics to the high emotion of the southern whooping tradition—in the way Sharpton commands a pulpit.\\n\\nThere would be no Sharpton without Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Sharpton met Powell at his church, the historic Abyssinian Baptist, when he was twelve years old, an experience that made him think he’d “seen God.” Powell began letting young Sharpton tag along while he held court around the city with everybody from the New York elites to its poor. Powell was a statesman and a pioneer of civil rights. (He led a bus boycott in Harlem fourteen years before MLK did in Montgomery.) He was irreverent to white power and had a flair for flamboyance. See Powell’s influence in how Sharpton has navigated the cultural and political milieu of New York, in his unabashed boldness.\\n\\nWouldn’t be an Al Sharpton without Jesse Jackson, whom he met as a teen when Jackson came to New York for a rally and the ribbon cutting of the city’s Operation Breadbasket office. Jackson was the organization’s national director and had established Saturday-morning rallies in Chicago, which drew thousands each week to hear him preach in person and on the radio. He was also, Sharpton noticed, full of swagger—at one point sporting a huge Afro and medallion—a young man who in many ways eschewed the aesthetic values of the older civil-rights leaders. See Jackson’s model in the fact that Sharpton has never pastored his own church, in the existence of his Saturday Action Rally, in the tracksuits and medallions Sharpton wore for decades, a defiance, too, of what a leader should look like. See it in how Sharpton struts around to handle his business.\\n\\nThere would be no Al Sharpton without Martin Luther King Jr. While Sharpton never spent significant time with MLK, as a boy he met him in Brooklyn while King was convalescing from a stab wound, later saw him preach at Washington Temple, and ended up working as the youth director of the New York chapter of MLK’s Operation Breadbasket. Still, MLK’s most enduring impact on Sharpton was posthumous. Sharpton was home watching TV with his mother the night that news of King’s assassination aired, and it made her weep as though she’d lost a family member. Sharpton asked his mother why she was so emotional. “You would’ve had to have grown up in Alabama”—Dothan—“like me and sit in the back of the bus, or have to use the bathroom and you wasn’t allowed, to understand what Martin Luther King meant to me,” she said. Sharpton decided that moment he wanted to matter like that.\\n\\nThe evolved version of Al Sharpton wouldn’t exist without Harry Belafonte, a man Sharpton befriended as an adult. By then Belafonte, who was one of the movement’s chief funders, had long been considered a giant of civil rights—esteem evident in his regal bearing. Belafonte would often advise Sharpton that the more he mattered, the more people would scrutinize his words, and therefore Sharpton needed to commit to perfection. That impossible pursuit, the greater consideration of his words, the self-possession of a man who believes he’s earned his status—count them as the Belafonte effect.\\n\\nBelieveyoume, there would be no Sharpton without James Brown, whom he met in 1973 after Brown’s son died in the car wreck. Brown’s fundraiser for the National Youth Movement was a big, big deal for Sharpton, whose parents loved the singer. “And if I thought I saw God with Adam Clayton Powell, I was sure I saw God with James Brown,” Sharpton recalls. The night they met, Brown told Sharpton that if he listened to him, he’d make him “a big man,” would help him get “the whole hog.” He told him to use every opportunity to be seen, that Sharpton couldn’t help the cause if nobody knew who he was. From Brown, “the hardest working man in show business,” Sharpton learned assiduousness and showmanship. From Brown he learned crucial lessons in survival and what it takes forreal, forreal, forreal to keep the Fifth Commandment: Honor thy father.\\n\\nOn that subject—a confession.\\n\\nUntil I met him, I was super judgmental of Sharpton’s conk. Deemed it rooted in my culture’s self-degrading, closer-to-white notion of good hair, not to mention an almost laughable anachronism.\\n\\nThe conk should’ve been left to Sammy Davis Jr. and Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry and Little Richard and the Temptations. The conk should’ve never lived past the heyday of the Godfather of Soul.\\n\\nWhich brings me to the story Sharpton told me about his indelible hairdo, which these days is swooped back over a thinning crown and silver, with remnants of brown at the edges.\\n\\nSo it goes, in 1982 Sharpton was headed to participate in marches aimed at turning MLK’s birthday into a national holiday but stopped to visit Brown in Georgia. He told Brown, almost as a dare, that he should ring President Reagan to help the cause. The call yielded an invite to meet Reagan and Vice President Bush on King’s birthday. Brown accepted on the condition he could bring Sharpton.\\n\\nAndre D Wagner Wherever Sharpton is—even in Harlem—people reach out to him, just as, so many times, he has reached out to them.\\n\\nBrown demanded Sharpton fly with him to D. C. Once there, he asked Sharpton for a favor. “When we land, I’m going to take you by Bobby Bennett of the Famous Flames”—one of Brown’s old backup singers—“and I want you do to your hair like mine,” said Brown. “We going to the White House tomorrow. And we’re going to be doing a lot of press. And I want when they see you, they see me. I want you to be a reflection of me.”\\n\\nThe next morning, January 15, Sharpton and Brown strolled into the White House—Sharpton’s first time—and met with Reagan and Bush, a visit that made national headlines and helped realize MLK Day into a federal holiday.\\n\\n“Reverend,” said Brown on the flight back to Augusta, “I want you to do me one more favor. I want you to keep your hair like that as long as I’m alive.”\\n\\nWhen Brown died, Sharpton flew to Augusta to help with the arrangements. He scheduled one of the memorials at the Apollo theater, and in the eleventh hour, Brown’s daughters picked a gold casket that was too heavy to fly in the singer’s private plane. The undertaker presented a work-around: drive Brown’s gilded coffin the almost eight hundred miles. Sharpton insisted on riding along with them.\\n\\nPicture Sharpton riding the whole time with his arm over the casket. Picture his conk a little messy yet nonetheless styled like that of the man he considered his father.\\n\\nSharpton never not conked since 1982.\\n\\nCome to find out the conk is a commitment, is Sharpton honoring a lifelong pledge beyond life. Shame on my ignorant arrogance when, after all, and maybe above all judgment, the man’s conk is worthy of my respect.\\n\\nOCALA, FLORIDA\\n\\nJUNE 12, 2023\\n\\nSharpton landed in Orlando around midnight and still managed to work out at 5:00 a.m. to meet his main goal of burning ninety calories, a slight figure for some, but for a man who home-scales himself every day and ranges between 133 and 134 pounds (this for someone who once weighed over 300), it’s plenty.\\n\\nThis article appeared in the March 2024 issue of Esquire\\n\\nSUBSCRIBE\\n\\nAt 9:00, several SUVs pull up outside the hotel to take the Sharpton retinue on the hour-or-so drive to Ocala for the funeral of Ajike “AJ” Owens, a mother shot through a door by her white neighbor for defending her children. On the ride, Sharpton makes plans to have his kale salad and green juice delivered to his house. He sips from a bottle of blue Listerine, swishes, and spits in a cup. He orders the AC off to protect his voice. He also nods to sleep, the first time I’ve seen him rest during any commute.\\n\\nMeadowbrook is a megachurch with a sprawling parking lot, and there’s some confusion about where to park. When the driver makes it at last to the right building, Meadowbrook’s pastor receives us. If anyone’s surprised that the pastor is a white man, no one says it. He and Sharpton enter the building side by side, the pastor informing him that the family would like to meet with him. Since Sharpton only attends funerals he’s been invited to, this happens almost everywhere, the family wanting to meet with him. It has got to the point where if an unarmed Black American is killed and Sharpton isn’t there, you might not ever hear about it (or might wonder where he is if you have heard). Sharpton’s presence is a message writ large that what happened deserves national attention, and I suspect his presence also affirms for the people who loved and cared about the victim that, however brief, this Black life was of consequence to more than just them.\\n\\nThe pastor leads us into the small office of his junior pastor. Sharpton asks for a funeral program and reads it while standing. Word soon arrives that Ben Crump, the civil-rights attorney—who, like Sharpton, also seems to be in every city where a Black person is shot or neck-kneeled or paralyzed in the back of a police van—will escort him to meet the family. “Hey, mentor,” he greets Sharpton, and leads him into a children’s recreation room that’s been repurposed as a convening room for the family.\\n\\nAJ’s four children and her mother are in the room. All are dressed in white and lavender—the boys in suits, the mother in a dress with a little flower and a lilac ribbon pinned to it. Crump introduces Sharpton to AJ’s mother, Pamela Dias, who is old enough to have a daughter who died at thirty-five but doesn’t look much older than that herself. Dias’s hair is done in neat braids and pulled into a high bun. A pulse after she meets Sharpton, she lays her head on his shoulder and closes her eyes.\\n\\nIt’s a moving sight. This mother in her grief seeking immediate consolation from a stranger. Only Sharpton isn’t a stranger to her, not to any Black person who’s lost someone to extralegal violence. He’s a father figure, an uncle, an elder. Someone notable for fighting for the underdogs, five decades plus. And this, what he’s doing now—showing up, receiving a head on his shoulder—could be perhaps the biggest piece of his legacy.\\n\\nNew York Daily News Archive James Brown, center, flanked by his daughter Diana and Sharpton at his most rotund, announcing Sharpton’s 1992 campaign for the U. S. Senate.\\n\\nA contingent of clergy attending the funerals of high-profile victims is not new. Several preachers and state officials showed up to the funeral of Emmett Till, albeit back then those preachers tended to be local and seemed to have a more intimate connection to the people involved.\\n\\nPastor A. R. Bernard, of the Brooklyn megachurch Christian Cultural Center, leads the family in prayer, calling for us to link hands and bow our heads.\\n\\nHearing the weeping under his words makes me feel obscene, as if I’ve intruded on the intimate grief of these people. While I’m sad about AJ’s death, she’s also a stranger to me, a fact that makes me question the measure of my bereavement, how real it is.\\n\\nSharpton will share that when he looks at the bodies, he realizes they could be one of his daughters or his grandson; he reflects on the fact that, if not for the grace of God, it could’ve been him. “I may not know the individuals,” he says, “but I know the experience.”\\n\\nIn introducing Sharpton, the Reverend R. B. Holmes, who runs the Tallahassee chapter of NAN, derides the cameras present—a blatant jab at Sharpton, Crump, and others he believes are here for the publicity.\\n\\n“We didn’t come for the cameras,” Sharpton says near the opening of his eulogy. “But if we come and help you get here, I want you cameras to show up. I don’t apologize for that. Because the world needs to know that we shouldn’t be at a funeral this morning.” He points to AJ’s open casket below him. “They want to bury what happened to AJ, but we’re not going to let them bury it. We’re not going to be quiet about it. We’re not going to apologize for it. . . . What happened to this family is wrong, and we come to stand with this family to call wrong, wrong.”\\n\\nSharpton addresses AJ’s oldest son, Isaac, who believes his mother wouldn’t have died if not for him. “Don’t feel guilty about nothing. Your mother chose to stand in danger’s way for you. She chose you over her. That’s what mothers do,” Sharpton says. “Isaac. Israel, Africa, Titus. Don’t grow up feeling guilty.” The crowd amens and booms applause louder than at any other point. “I want you to go and be everything she wanted you to be,” he tells Isaac. “I want you to go on to college and I want your brothers and sisters to be something, and if you don’t have any money, call me and say, ‘You showed up at my mother’s funeral. I need to go to college.’ Just like I showed up today for you, I want to show up at your graduation. And I want you to put your fist in the air and say, ‘I’m AJ’s boy.’ ”\\n\\nThe eulogy includes Sharpton rebutting people who tell him to preach the word but stay away from civil rights and politics. “Well, maybe you got a different Bible than I got,” he says, picking up his Bible and shaking it. “Because in my Bible, the second book was about the exodus of slaves from slavery. My Bible had David made king—that’s political. Solomon made king—that’s political. Esther went against the genocide of her whole people. If you take all that out the Bible, you ain’t got much left.\\n\\n“I was not born at a time when they walked to the Red Sea,” he shouts. “I wasn’t born at a time when they went to the Jordan. I wasn’t there when Goliath mocked the Israeli army. But I was there when they shot Trayvon. I was there when they choked Eric Garner. I was around when they put their knee on George Floyd’s neck. And I was around when you shot through the door at AJ!”\\n\\nNEW ORLEANS\\n\\nJUNE 30–JULY 3, 2023\\n\\nThe Essence Festival, which began as an intended one-time event to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of Essence magazine in 1995, is now billed as the largest Black cultural and music event in the country. Today it’s a concert series. It’s a cultural forum. It’s parties upon parties. A place for Black folks to gather, from nine-to-fivers who save and scrimp for a weekend vacay to the Black elite, celebs included, who are part of its billing.\\n\\nNew York Times Co. Sharpton, at just seven years old, preaching at Washington Temple in Brooklyn, 1961. He was known as the Wonderboy in local Black churches.\\n\\nThe festival and the city of New Orleans treat Sharpton, who has attended every Essence Festival since it began, like a dignitary, providing him two chauffeured SUVs and a police detail. Everywhere he goes, a squad car with its turrets flashing and sirens blaring leads the way. His SUVs pull up to the back of the conference center, where a gaggle of security including Secret Service await. The increased security is for Vice President Kamala Harris, slated to speak today. Men with little spiral cords behind their ears make everyone sit in their vehicles while they use mirrors to check undercarriages for bombs. Once finished, festival handlers wheel Sharpton inside the building on carts. He meets with the vice president in private ahead of her event as well as ahead of his first official event of the festival: participating in a panel on “Broadband and Social Justice” (the subject more pressing given that the Supreme Court ruled against affirmative action the day before).\\n\\nThe next day—a crisis.\\n\\nHis headbands. His headbands.\\n\\nSharpton has forgotten his headbands at home because he himself—not, per usual, Aisha—packed his suitcase. The headbands are not only a key part of his workout look, to which he is committed, but also a staple of his morning ritual. And Sharpton is a man who believes in the power of rituals—diet, workout, morning messages, daily cigar. He calls up his security detail and off they go to hunt—the journey turreted and sirened.\\n\\nOn the word of one of the officers in his detail, Sharpton ends up at Riverwalk Outlets, hunting for the Nike store. It’s not yet noon, but you wouldn’t know it from how busy the mall is. Sharpton, who wears a black “Stay Woke” shirt under his dress shirt and gingham suit, walks toward the far end of the mall. People whip their heads and crane to see him. Every few steps, no lie, someone stops him to snap a picture. And Sharpton obliges them all with a wide smile, never once appearing put-upon. “Those women remind me of my aunts, my mother. And I never want to disappoint them. I want them to be proud of me,” he’ll say. The moment he finishes posing for one pic, someone grabs at his sleeve for another. Grandmas run up and demand a selfie with him, check it on the spot, and sometimes request a retake. A few white couples gape or point in his direction. So many folks shout, “Hey, Rev!” that it almost becomes a chorus.\\n\\nIt occurs to me that Sharpton, notoriety no doubt enhanced by his homage hairdo, is one of the most famous people in America. Only fame isn’t quite the right word. It’s not excitement at seeing a celebrity, exactly—not the way people would swarm, say, Eddie Murphy or Denzel. It’s more an appreciation for Sharpton, for someone who for decades has been fighting for his people, poor people, the disenfranchised. They feel close enough to him that they can reach out to him, the way he has, at many points, reached out to them.\\n\\nLater that day, he’s headed to Ben Crump’s annual Essence barbecue when Crump calls to inform him that the actor Jonathan Majors, embattled by allegations of assaulting his former girlfriend (he’s since been convicted on misdemeanor charges), will be there. Crump explains that he’s not representing Majors but that he agreed to try and connect him with Sharpton.\\n\\nAndre D Wagner Sharpton in Harlem.\\n\\nThe barbecue is held in a modest house that’s so packed it’s hard to walk through. Grown folks, teenagers, and a few kids sit on couches, on the edges of tables, in chairs in an alcove, on a twin bed in somebody’s room. There are a hundred or so people in the backyard, eating at picnic tables under a gazebo, drinking beneath a covered bar. Crump announces Sharpton to the crowd, and he speaks for a few minutes, as does Majors.\\n\\nLess than an hour later, Sharpton weaves through the sweltering house back to his SUV. Crump shuffles out after him, the enormous, muscled Majors in tow. Majors huffs over to Sharpton’s window. Excuse me, sir, do you mind if we take a picture together? he asks.\\n\\n“I don’t think that’s a good idea right now,” Sharpton says. “I don’t think that’s a good idea if I’m going to help you.”\\n\\nIt’s the one and only photo I see him decline in all our time together. Sharpton, an astute strategist for sure, never gets involved with Majors’s case.\\n\\nJACKSON, MISSISSIPPI\\n\\nJUNE 9, 2023\\n\\nIn all the world, I meet Sharpton for the very first time in the driveway of Medgar Evers’s home in Jackson. Meet Sharpton a few steps away from the carport where Evers was struck in the back by a sniper’s bullet and bled to death in the arms of his wife, Myrlie. Sharpton and a coterie that includes his younger daughter, Ashley, stand on this narrow slab of concrete while a white state trooper lectures them on the details of Evers’s assassination and facts about the teal-blue bungalow, which is now a national monument.\\n\\nSharpton tours the house, which includes school photos of the Evers children and the fridge that was in the home at the time of the murder, as well as the bullet hole in it from the assassin’s rifle.\\n\\nSharpton is in Jackson to deliver a keynote address for the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Institute gala—this year marks sixty years since Evers’s murder, a death that fueled the timing of the March on Washington.\\n\\nThat evening, a phalanx of people enter the Jackson Convention Complex, one of them pushing Evers’s widow, who is seated on a walker but might as well be floating in her resplendent red pantsuit of sparkly brocade and lace. Myrlie, the first woman to head the NAACP, beams at Sharpton, who runs over to hug her. “Oh my God, baby, I didn’t know I’d see you,” she says. “Oh Lord, I haven’t seen you in so long.” She takes one of his hands in hers, which are wrinkled, veined—proof of her ninety years on earth. They chat a bit, still palm in palm, Sharpton’s daughter photographing them with her phone.\\n\\nOne is subject to think that Myrlie’s era of civil rights is so bygone that all its leaders have passed. But here she is—alive, regal, sublime. And here is Sharpton, who is one of the most prominent and active people in the extant struggle for civil rights, although in this moment, more a boy in awe of his elder. “Sixty years and we’re still fighting,” he tells Myrlie.\\n\\nWASHINGTON, D. C.\\n\\nAUGUST 26, 2023\\n\\nCan’t tell you what time MLK rose on August 28, 1963, the day he delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech at the March on Washington. But I can testify that on August 26, 2023, the Reverend Al Sharpton wakes before sunrise and, as he always does, addresses his two million Instagram followers with his morning thoughts before a predawn workout: “Grand rising. Slow down. Don’t rush into this day. There’s a zone of calmness, or peace, of collecting your thoughts. Collecting your feelings. And in that zone, you eliminate then your negative thoughts.” Can’t tell you how MLK prepared the morning he gave his speech, the last half of which he improvised, but I can tell you Sharpton saunters into his hotel gym wearing a NAN T-shirt, shorts, sneakers, socks, and a headband—all black. That he lays his phone, clear glasses, and towel on a bench, bops to the far end of the small gym, and records his morning thoughts. That he calls a NAN employee to check on the busloads traveling from New York to D. C. That he sets his cell on the bench playing Aretha Franklin’s uplifting gospel tune “How I Got Over” on speaker, stretches his quads, and does a few body squats. That he super-sets dumbbell curls and lat pull-downs to “Climbing Higher Mountains,” another of Franklin’s buoyant gospel songs. That he walks the length of the gym between his sets—always moving, always moving. That he climbs on the elliptical and, to Survivor’s “Eye of the Tiger,” goes double, triple, quadruple speed—backward. That he goes straight from the elliptical to the rowing machine, the inspiration of “Eye of the Tiger” on repeat. That he finishes his workout having not drunk a sip of water.\\n\\nThe original March on Washington was the brainchild of Bayard Rustin and labor leader A. Philip Randolph. The march had been paused for several years on account of the government placating movement leaders and their allies with small concessions. But then Medgar Evers was assassinated, and anger over his death and the obvious appeasements spurred action. Sharpton’s 2023 march has been fueled by a spike in racial terror and bald-faced prejudice, by a Supreme Court bent on dismantling affirmative action, by forces doing their damnedest to undo the protections of the Voting Rights Act, by the persistence of widening wealth gaps.\\n\\nIn important ways, this is a different Al Sharpton from the man who spoke at the fortieth anniversary of the March on Washington. “I learned you have to think with your head and not play into the stereotypes that they can dismiss easily,” he tells me. “A lot of my brashness and shooting from the hip was out of my real feelings. And I feel my evolution was, If I really feel that way, I have to be more disciplined. Where I can express the same feeling but in a way that they can’t compromise and in any way make me the side issue,” he says. “Where I become a caricature rather than somebody that’s delivering a message that needs to be heard in the higher halls of power.”\\n\\nThough nowhere near the shoulder-to-shoulder, far-as-the-eye-could-see crowd of the original March on Washington, there are scores of white people and Asian people and brown people and a multitude of Black people on the mall in the high heat of D. C.’s summer. The area around the steps of the Lincoln Memorial has been cordoned off with crowd-control barriers. Inside the barriers, organizers have set up a podium near the base of the memorial’s steps (old Abe looming in the shadows) and scaffold bleachers for press near the back. Between the podium and the bleachers are several rows of padded fold-up chairs, seats that, to be real, never quite fill up. Right outside the back gate, a jumbo screen shows the speakers on the podium.\\n\\nThe Reflecting Pool and Washington Monument serve as a grand not-so-distant backdrop.\\n\\nBeneath a super-blue sky scanted with gauzy clouds, women wear bright, long dresses and hold umbrellas to fend off the sun, wear Nike T-shirts and backward baseball caps, wear shorts and cross-body bags. Men wear suits and ties, dashikis and African-print pants. There’s a whole damn panoply of hairdos: Dreadlocks. Afros. Braids. Twists. Curls. Ponytails. Shaved heads. Dyed hair. Plus umpteen groups decked in matching T-shirts. Plus several people sporting pride flags. See daring youngsters plopped right on the blazing asphalt. See elders lounging in parade chairs positioned in the shade. And everyother whichway you look, somebody’s proffering a pamphlet or hoisting a sign: “Silence Is Complicity,” “What’s at Stake? Our Right Our Lives Our Futures,” “I Vote Because,” “Believe Survivors,” “Environmental Justice = Racial Justice = Criminal Justice,” “Movements don’t die because struggle doesn’t die.” A woman troops across the mall lugging signage for “Speaker check-in.”\\n\\nThe speaker check-in tent is in a grassy field a couple hundred yards behind the mall. Inside there are fold-up tables and chairs, a cameraman with a point-and-shoot, a headphoned sound tech angling a boom pole overhead, folks filming footage on cell phones or chatting or hunting for the crafty table.\\n\\nFor a time, director Mario Van Peebles is the center of attention in and around the tent, posing for pictures, spinning stories, being interviewed. Then Andrew Young, once a close confidant of MLK, wheels in on a motorized scooter and usurps the most regard. The writer Michael Eric Dyson moseys in, grabs a seat, and chitchats with the people at his table, who include Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin, and RowVaughn Wells, the mother of Tyre Nichols, the young man beaten to death by Memphis police.\\n\\nSharpton never enters the tent; instead, he receives a few notables in his trailer, which is parked a hundred or so yards away. Among them, his mentee Ben Crump and billionaires Robert Kraft and Robert Smith, all of whom are scheduled to speak at the rally. Once they leave, Sharpton shifts between fielding anxious calls about logistics and preparing to speak.\\n\\nHis actual speech is hurried—“we’re not going to take long,” he announces—as he’s mindful of the pressure from the National Park Service. He heads a short march from the mall to a stage near the MLK Memorial, helping to hold the banner and, to the backing of a spirited marching band, lead chants.\\n\\n“What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now! What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now! What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now!”\\n\\nJustice—what is it? Is it the most important of the cardinal virtues? Is it Socrates’ old mandate that citizens should do their own thing and not meddle with that of another? Is its best definition Justinian’s: “the constant and perpetual will to render each his due”? Or is it, as one Sophist argued, the natural right of the stronger?\\n\\nFor some, justice might look like what MLK once described as the ultimate logic of racism: that another person isn’t fit to live.\\n\\nAround the same time that thousands gather in D. C. to decry racism and injustice, a white man who must’ve believed in that illogic, a despicable who made clear his hatred of Black people, marches into a Dollar General store in Jacksonville, Florida, and kills three Black people and then himself.\\n\\nSharpton learns of the murders dashing from the rally to tape his show at the D. C. bureau of NBC. He rings the attorney general’s office for details, which are scarce at first, but by the time Sharpton finishes his show, it’s clear the murders are a hate crime. No sooner than his return to the hotel does Sharpton get a call back about the shooting from U. S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. Sharpton, collar still smudged with TV makeup, steps away for what feels like an hour but is short of it.\\n\\n“That was the attorney general,” he says, “asking me, What should we do?”'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\\n\\nDonald Trump is a notoriously dishonest man, but one of his oft-used slogans has proved absolutely true: Promises Made, Promises Kept. Unfortunately, this time around, the promises being kept weren’t all made by Trump. They were made by the fanatics who penned Project 2025.\\n\\nYes, Elon Musk is Trump’s right-hand man (J.D. who?), and he is on a tear with the Department of Government Efficiency, employing gangs of young men barely out of puberty to decide which pieces of—and people in—the federal government should stay or go. But the mass firings, the power grabs, and the agency shutterings are not just Musk’s doing. They were planned and proposed well before Trump was even elected, right there for everyone to see, in Project 2025.\\n\\nTrump may have said he had “nothing to do with” the far-right game plan for his presidency—always a dubious claim, given that its architects are either former administration members or people with close ties to it. But now that he’s in office, he’s following their plan almost to the letter.\\n\\nA month into Trump’s presidency, I went back through the Project 2025 “Mandate for Leadership.” It was stunning just how closely it tracked with the Trump presidency, not just in content but also in strategy. One of the first arguments the document makes is that new presidents have a narrow window within which to implement their agenda; hesitating while they sort out policy details wastes precious time. And, indeed, Trump has hit the ground running. The only way he has been able to do so much is because the Project 2025 team wrote it all out for him.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAs Democrats and the public struggle to even keep up with what the Trump administration is doing to the nation, it’s tempting to get caught up in the play-by-play. And although the details certainly are important, the single message must be this: Trump is trying to be a king or a dictator, and Project 2025 is his monarchical playbook.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThis is not a tough argument to make, especially given that Trump is now sharing images of himself in a crown, writing, “LONG LIVE THE KING!” This cannot and will not stand. Trump is not a king, and we don’t have to collectively pretend that he is or act as if this is some sort of joke—just as we don’t have to tolerate unelected lunatics from the Heritage Foundation or unelected egomaniacal billionaires setting the rules for a pluralistic America.\\n\\nIn its first section, the “Mandate for Leadership” sets out Project 2025’s overarching ideology: a theory of an all-powerful president, someone with authority more akin to that of a monarch than an elected democratic leader. The core section on this comes from Russell Vought, now the Trump-appointed director of the Office of Management and Budget, essentially the central nerve center of the federal government. The idea of agency or expert “independence”—with independence rendered in scare quotes—is rejected. “The greatest challenge” ahead, Vought writes, is “aggressive use of the vast powers of the executive branch,” which requires the “boldness to bend or break the bureaucracy to the presidential will.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIf Trump has done one thing so far, it’s break the federal bureaucracy.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe best way to implement the Project 2025 vision, its authors are clear, is to gut the federal bureaucracy, firing career civil servants and those who lack the requisite MAGA loyalty. “The new Administration must fill its ranks with political appointees,” the document flat-out directs. The Office of the White House Counsel, for example, should not be some fair-minded place for smart lawyers to assess presidential actions according to existing law; it should be an “activist” entity, with subordinates who “see their role as helping to accomplish the agenda through problem solving and advocacy.” And forget expertise or qualifications: “While a candidate with elite credentials might seem ideal, the best one will be above all loyal to the President and the Constitution.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTrump has been in office only a month, and already thousands of federal employees have been fired, some allegedly for performance, though in most cases no proof has been proffered. (And parts of this firing spree may very well be illegal—Trump’s layoffs at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, for example, have been halted by a judge.)\\n\\nMany of these workers are veterans or members of military families. Their work includes things like researching cancer, running national parks, responding to natural disasters, ensuring aviation safety, and providing health care to those who served in combat. And these rapid, poorly planned firings have resulted in a bunch of mistakes: Some workers have been fired, only to be told, Whoops, you’re actually still employed! (Some were then fired again.) The administration sacked several Department of Agriculture workers, only to realize that some of them were crucial members of a team protecting the public from bird flu, and quickly walked back the terminations.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHiring has been more challenging, including when it comes to staffing the administration itself. Finding staffers who show total loyalty to Trump and who aren’t suspected to be ideologically compromised by, say, working for a Republican or even a former Trump official who has fallen out of the president’s favor, leaves precious few qualified candidates to choose from. Loyalty tests and purges are standard; requirements for MAGA fealty are high. Under regimes like this one, competency and qualification tend to be the first things to go. Qualified candidates make way simply for candidates.\\n\\nThere must be a German word to describe this particular combination of ironic and hypocritical: Conservatives obsess over “DEI” supposedly requiring the hiring of unqualified workers and accuse diversity initiatives of causing plane crashes, then turn around and forgo qualifications and competency in favor of unthinking devotion. (When it comes to the people working in the Trump White House, I feel fairly confident in saying that America is not sending her best.)\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nRelated From Slate We Need to Accept Why the Resistance Got So Incredibly Annoying Last Time Read More\\n\\nBut this is also part of the strategy, one well practiced by autocrats throughout history: Make it ridiculous. Hire absolute nincompoops. Reward doggish devotion rather than actual qualification. After all, those who are unqualified understand that their power and position come only from the autocrat. With no reputation or future to protect, they have every incentive to stay loyal.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOn the campaign trail, Trump claimed to have never read Project 2025. I would bet he still hasn’t—he doesn’t strike me as much of a reader. But he has surrounded himself with its architects. And according to a recent CNN analysis, more than two-thirds of his executive orders seem to stem from Project 2025 mandates. The very existence of this how-to manual has allowed this administration to flood the zone so effectively: The plans were all there, just waiting to be put into action.\\n\\nThis doesn’t mean that Project 2025’s creators have gotten everything they want. They’re hostile to Big Tech, for example, in ways that this administration—now partially run by a tech billionaire—is not. Their plans for the U.S. Agency for International Development involve drastically reshaping the organization in a Christian nationalist image, not totally destroying it. For the most part, though, the strategy has worked exactly as intended.\\n\\nThe job of fighting back is a complicated one. Opponents have to meet these attacks wherever and however they come—the response to flooding the zone cannot be to cede the zone. Democratic Party leaders, though, have a particular task, and that’s to make all this legible to an overwhelmed, exhausted, and largely tuned-out U.S. public. The extremists of the Heritage Foundation and MAGA and DOGE have their narrative: This is about restoring power to a president who should be nearly all-powerful, who has a mandate to lead, whose opponents are enemies not of Donald Trump but of America, and who is going to break through any barrier (including the thin parchment of the Constitution) to get done whatever needs doing.\\n\\nDemocrats need to zoom out and respond with their own: This is actually about protecting America the democracy from a power-drunk mad king and his billionaire boys’ club.'}],\n",

       "   'content': 'Nature lovers flock to Yosemite National Park every February to witness the majestic \"firefall\" event, but this year’s crowds were met a different spectacle: an upside-down American flag hung on a summit to protest the Trump administration’s cuts of national park service employees.\\n\\nThe flag was hung on the top of the famed El Capitan summit, a 3,000-foot vertical rock formation in Mariposa County, California, on Saturday evening by a group of upset Yosemite employees.\\n\\nAn upside-down American flag is traditionally a sign of “dire distress,” according to the United States Flag Code.\\n\\nThe demonstration came at a time when all eyes are on the summit for the firefall viewing event — a phenomenon that unfolds in February when Horsetail Falls, a seasonal waterfall on the east side of El Capitan, takes on an orange, lava-like glow as the sun sets. The event attracts a flurry of photographers who wait hours for the perfect shot.\\n\\n“We’re bringing attention to what’s happening to the parks, which are every American’s properties,” Gavin Carpenter, a maintenance mechanic at the park who supplied the flag, told The San Francisco Chronicle. “It’s super important we take care of them, and we’re losing people here, and it’s not sustainable if we want to keep the parks open.”\\n\\nThe Trump administration cut 1,000 jobs at the National Park Service earlier this month in a push to cut federal bureaucracy and spending. Impacted national park and forest employees say fewer workers will lead to longer lines, filthy bathrooms and unsafe hiking and camping conditions at America\\'s precious public lands. For many, the job already paid a low salary, compensated by breathtaking views and sunsets.\\n\\nAn upside-down U.S. flag hangs over Yosemite\\'s El Capitan in protest over federal worker cuts. @brittanycolt / Instagram\\n\\nPhotographer Brittany Colt snapped the view of the upside-down flag next to the firefall.\\n\\n“This hit so close to home for me. I witnessed several of my friends lose their jobs overnight while leaving our public lands vulnerable. These people had very valuable jobs, such as Search and Rescue and keeping the restrooms and park clean for visitors. If we lose the public servants, the park experience will get only harder and potentially more dangerous for visitors,” she wrote on her Instagram story.\\n\\nAlex Wild, a former Yosemite and the only certified EMT ranger at Devils Postpile National Monument in California, told NBC’s Morgan Chesky last week: “I’m the only person available to rescue someone, to do CPR, to carry them out from a trail if they got injured.”\\n\\nHe said without him, people will likely wait hours for local first responders to arrive. “It could mean life or death for someone who’s having an emergency,” Wild said.\\n\\nThe Trump administration later said it would restore at least 50 jobs to maintain and clean parks, and would hire nearly 3,000 additional seasonal workers following backlash over the cuts, The Associated Press reported.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'On May 16, 2024, a powerful derecho swept through Houston, killing seven people and causing significant damage to several of the city\\'s towering skyscrapers. Those buildings were constructed to withstand much stronger hurricane-force winds up to 67 meters per second, as one would get with a Category 4 hurricane. The derecho\\'s winds peaked at 40 meters per second, well below that threshold. And when Hurricane Beryl hit Houston that July with roughly comparable wind speeds of 36 meters per second, the damage wasn\\'t nearly so severe. Why would that be the case?\\n\\nEngineers at Florida International University (FIU) in Miami think they\\'ve found the answer, according to a new paper published in the journal Frontiers in Built Environment. \"We show that a type of highly localized strong winds called ‘downbursts,’ which were generated during the May derecho, can significantly impact tall buildings and facades due to their unique characteristics in comparison to hurricanes,” said co-author Amal Elawady. This is particularly the case for skyscrapers that are close together, creating a \"wind-channeling\" interference effect that increases pressure on walls and windows.\\n\\nOne might assume that hurricanes and derechos are similar in that they both produce markedly intense winds, but the origin and characteristics of those winds are very different, per the authors. Hurricanes are vast tropical storms that form over warm ocean waters and affect large areas, usually lasting for several days, accompanied by heavy rains, storm surges, waves, and yes, high winds. By contrast, derechos and downbursts are much more localized convective systems, producing hurricane-force winds but over a much smaller area and shorter period of time.\\n\\nThere are more than 2,000 skyscrapers higher than 200 meters worldwide that are especially vulnerable to high winds, and understanding those differences is crucial to coming up with better mitigation strategies in the future. Hurricane impacts tend to be widespread and can cause a lot of damage to the glass and cladding of skyscrapers, such as the damage Hurricane Katrina inflicted on tall buildings in New Orleans in 2005. Damage from derechos and downbursts causes more severe, concentrated damage, such as the collapse of a 37-story building in Brazil in 2011.'},\n",

We\\'re more modest than that here at Ars, although we wouldn\\'t turn away some new subscribers.\\n\\nIn reality, even as the near-Earth asteroid 2024 YR4 was moving away, ground-based telescopes were able to gather enough observations to get a better handle on its orbit. So we can safely take a deep breath and return to the more pressing existential problems posed by threats on this planet rather than off-world.\\n\\nHowever, there is something that we should all take away from this experience.\\n\\nAstronomers will find a lot more of these\\n\\nCity-killer asteroids the size of 2024 YR4 are fairly common in the inner Solar System. This asteroid was likely somewhere between 40 and 100 meters across, which is large enough to cause regional destruction on the planet, but small enough to be difficult to find with most telescopes. However, we should expect to find more of them in the coming years.\\n\\n\"An object the size of YR4 passes harmlessly through the Earth-Moon neighborhood as frequently as a few times per year,\" Richard Binzel, one of the world\\'s leading asteroid experts and a professor of planetary sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told Ars. \"The YR4 episode is just the beginning for astronomers gaining the capability to see these objects before they come calling through our neck of the woods.\"'},\n",

One person in the racist outfit was carrying a makeshift cross.\\n\\nVideos by VICE\\n\\nIn a statement to Global News, Fire Chief Lloyd MacIntosh said the people in Ku Klux Klan costumes were admitted by volunteers working the door.\\n\\n“A mistake was made,” he admitted. “They were allowed in, they shouldn’t have been.”\\n\\nVolunteers asked the people to remove their hoods, but some refused, MacIntosh said. He added that a volunteer took away the cross one person was carrying.\\n\\nFirefighters Speak Out About the Racist Costume\\n\\nIn a statement posted to Facebook, the club admitted that it “made a mistake!”\\n\\n“We apologize to any and all of our community who were offended or hurt by our lack of actions,” the post read. “These four individuals are in no way, shape or form associated with our organization. We promise to be better in the future.”\\n\\nWade Gouthro, the Deputy Fire Chief, also spoke out about the controversy in a Facebook post.\\n\\n“I can honestly tell you that the situation at the North Sydney Firefighters club is not who we are or what we stand for,” Gouthro wrote, before admitting that he’d been “very reluctant” to address the situation due to fear of adding “fuel to the fire.”\\n\\n“I can tell you this, the members of North Sydney and myself are very sorry from the bottom of our hearts and we ask for your forgiveness,” he continued. “We would certainly never intentionally hurt or insult anyone regardless of race, color, orientation or religion.

       "   'content': 'The cause of last year’s deadly wildfires in Maui, Hawaii, has been revealed. The August 2023 blaze that left more than 100 people dead was caused by the re-energization of broken utility lines in Lahaina, according to an investigation released Wednesday by the Maui Fire Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.\\n\\nThe fire has been classified as accidental. Per the report, the re-energization of the line caused sparks, which ignited overgrown vegetation at a surrounding utility pole. The overhead and energized power line fell to the ground, further igniting vegetation.\\n\\nVideos by VICE\\n\\nInvestigators initially believed they had extinguished the fire, which started around 6:30 AM, but undetected smoldering material reignited the second phase of the fire hours later, just before 3 PM.\\n\\n“We want to make abundantly clear to Lahaina and to our Maui community that our firefighters went above and beyond their due diligence to be as confident as they could be that the fire was completely extinguished before they left the scene,” Assistant Chief Jeffrey Giesea said, per NBC News.\\n\\nAccording to the report, “Fed by extreme winds, the fire quickly grew out of control, jumped the bypass, and resulted in the subsequent conflagration from which our island community is still recovering.”\\n\\nThe fire destroyed over 2,000 structures and caused $6 billion in damages.\\n\\nThe report’s findings may or may not sway conspiracy theorists who believe the U.S. government used directed energy weapons to cause the deadly blazes to turn Maui into a “smart island.”'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Masked men recently proved the ongoing presence of anti-semites in America. During a performance of The Diary of Anne Frank in Michigan, a group of men holed up in front of the venue, waving Nazi flags and spewing slurs.\\n\\nThe Fowlerville Community Theatre was hosting the play at American Legion Devereaux Post 141 when they became aware of “the presence of self-identified Nazi protesters,” according to a press release.\\n\\nVideos by VICE\\n\\nBobby Brite, past commander of the legion, recorded a video of the protestors and shared it to Facebook. He told The Detroit News that the group of 10 masked men chanted things including “Anne Frank was a whore” during their anti-semitic showing. Frank was 15 when she died at a concentration camp in 1945.\\n\\n“They are some of the most cowardly people I’ve ever met,” Brite told the outlet of the “absolutely disgusting” protest.\\n\\n“There was a group of people at the four-way intersection in downtown that had swastika flags and American flags,” Alex Sutfill, a witness, told the local CBS station. “They were sticking their arms up and yelling ‘Hail Hitler‘ and ‘Hail Trump’ and everything like that.”\\n\\nHow the Protest Was Handled\\n\\nThe theater group alerted the American Legion staff on duty of the situation and was assured they were already aware of and monitoring the men, who moved out of the legion’s parking lot when asked.\\n\\nAfterwards, the demonstrators went “across the street and waved flags adorned with Nazi insignia,” the Livingston County Sheriff’s Office told The Detroit News. “A subject then approached them, and an argument ensued.”\\n\\nPeter Damerow told the local CBS station that he was the one who confronted the group. In response, he claimed, “They looked at me and one of them said, ‘No this is Pureville now, and we’re here to make sure it stays pure.’”\\n\\n“Nothing physical transpired and ultimately the parties involved separated,” the sheriff’s office said.\\n\\nStill, “out of an abundance of caution,” the group alerted the audience members to the situation at intermission.\\n\\n“For this production, our cast was also on stage in character during intermission, which was when they found out as well,” the press release read. “Although some were understandably shaken, they pulled together and finished the performance with strength and professionalism.”\\n\\nHow the Situation Mirrors History\\n\\nChuck Firman, president of the Fowlerville Community Theatre, added in a statement to the The Detroit News, “It was a scary moment. But really, the show must go on.”\\n\\nThe theater’s press release further noted how the ordeal, which ended when the protestors left before the end of the show, “gave us a small glimpse of the fear and uncertainty felt by those in hiding.”\\n\\nIndeed, Brite told the local ABC station, “We had 75 people downstairs that watched that play and out of that 75, there were 50 or 60 of them that were afraid to leave this building. We had to escort them to their cars. No one in America should feel like that.”\\n\\n“As a theatre, we want to make people feel and think,” the press release read. “We hope that by presenting Anne’s story, we can help prevent the atrocities of the past from happening again.”\\n\\nThe Anti-Defamation League’s Michigan outpost said In a statement, “disgusted by the far-right extremists who praised Hitler and waved Nazi flags” at the event.\\n\\nIn October, the organization found that, following Hamas’ October 2023 attack on Israel, there were 10,000 antisemitic incidents in the U.S. That’s a 200 percent increase from the previous year.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'A special court martial handed down a reprimand to an Army lieutenant colonel who was caught putting cameras in the dressing room of a clothing store by a 16-year-old girl. The Lt. Col., who fled from police when caught, pleaded guilty but will serve no jail time.\\n\\nThe slap on the wrist comes after civilian prosecutors initially attempted to pursue a criminal conviction. The Army convinced the court to let it handle the matter internally, however, and the officer was instead prosecuted through the Uniform Code of Military Justice. (UCMJ). Further, Motherboard found while seeking records related to the case that the court documents have since been sealed.\\n\\nVideos by VICE\\n\\nThe case illustrates a disturbing trend where the Pentagon swoops in to protect its soldiers when they commit a crime. If convicted in a civilian court, Sweatland could have served up to a year in jail. Instead, a military judge issued a reprimand, an official black mark on Swetland’s military record.\\n\\nWhen asked if Sweatland would have to register as a sex offer, a representative for the U.S. Army Cadet Command told Motherboard it would comply with state law. “A court-martial convicted Lt. Col. Sweatland of a qualifying sex-related offense. The Army is complying with all sex-related offense processing requirements,” Maj. Dan Lessard, spokesman for U.S. Army Cadet Command, told Motherboard.\\n\\nAt the time of his arrest, Lt. Col. Jacob Sweatland was the head of the Army’s Reserve Offcier’s Training Corps program at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. He was responsible for shaping a new generation of U.S. military officers. In September 2022, Sweatland left a key fob with a hidden camera in it at a PacSun in San Luis Obispo. A 16-year-old girl found the camera and turned it in, and the store called the cops.\\n\\nThe cops took a look at the camera and found it still contained images and video from other dressing rooms in the area. Sweatland later called the store asking if anyone had found his key fob. The clerk, who was working with police, told Sweatland that someone had found it and he could come and retrieve it. The cops were waiting at the scene.\\n\\nThe details of the case from San Luis Obispo court records which were publicly available at the time of Sweatland’s arrest but are now sealed as part of his plea deal. Pieces of the records still exist from local reporting over the past few years. According to the now-sealed court records, which said that Sweatland faced charges of resisting arrest and obstructing justice in addition to invasion of privacy, the Lt. Col. fled when he got to the store and saw the cops. The police eventually tracked Sweatland down and arrested him.\\n\\nMustang News, reporting based on court records that were available in 2023, said that Sweatland’s fob contained images from several locations including other retail establishments and the gym at the Cal Poly Rec center. The video was shot “from covert angles” and showed “women’s backsides as they [preformed] various exercises wearing shorts and tight fitting athletic wear.” At the time of his arrest, Sweatland was removed from his position at the University but wasn’t charged for the recordings because they were taken in a public area.\\n\\nAs the case against Sweatland moved forward last year, he and his lawyers did what they could to avoid civilian justice. Before the case was handed over to military prosecutors, Sweatland attempted to get it dismissed as a “Military Diversion.” In California, veterans and servicemembers can ask for courts to dismiss charges if the defendant is “suffering from sexual trauma, traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, or mental health problems as a result of his or her military service.”\\n\\nAccording to court records, Sweatland’s defense team claimed that he’d undergone intensive therapy since his arrest. Sweatland’s service was no joke, he deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Colombia and earned a Bronze Star and a Ranger Tab. He saw combat and it’s possible he’s suffering from service related PTSD. But the court of SLO wasn’t buying it.\\n\\n“The calculated and covert method in which Defendant repeatedly targeted vulnerable young women demonstrates little potential for rehabilitation in the Military Diversion Program,” court records filed by the prosecutors said.\\n\\nAfter his attempt at using the Military Diversion Program was thwarted, the Army stepped in.\\n\\n“When disposing of allegations of misconduct, the Army regularly coordinates with federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement and prosecution authorities. In July 2023, the San Luis Obispo District Attorney’s Office initiated contact with the Army and requested the Army prosecute this case,” Lessard said. “After careful consideration of the evidence and in consultation with the victim, the Army preferred court-martial charges against Lt. Col. Sweatland on July 13, 2023.”\\n\\nThe military conducted an investigation of its own and handed down the reprimand during a special court martial. “On Jan. 22, 2024, at a special court-martial convened at Fort Knox, Ky., Lt. Col. Jacob J. Sweatland was convicted by a military judge, pursuant to his pleas, of one specification of indecent visual recording and one specification of conduct unbecoming an officer in violation of Articles 120c and 133, UCMJ. The military judge sentenced the accused to be reprimanded. The sentence was consistent with the terms of a plea agreement,” Lessard told Motherboard.\\n\\nHe explained that a reprimand is a punitive public censure. “A reprimand reflects negatively on a soldier’s military record and negatively affects a soldier’s career,” Lessard said. Despite the black mark, Sweatland does still have a career. He is currently assigned to the 8th Brigade of U.S. Army Cadet Command and is serving in an administrative role away from cadets.”\\n\\nThe Sweatland case highlights a problem with civilian-military relations and the Pentagon writ large. This is a persistent problem in the Army. In 2017, a soldier at Fort Hood allegedly assaulted his wife and fired a gun as she fled their home. The Army kicked him out of the service but did not pursue a case against him. The same thing happened the same year in Alaska after a soldier was accused of sexually assaulting a fellow soldier.\\n\\nIn both cases, there was physical evidence of the crime and no prosecution. The soldiers were simply allowed to return to civilian life. The Pentagon often runs cover for its soldiers, which creates a separate system of justice for those who serve.\\n\\nMotherboard asked Cadet Command to respond to concerns that the Army’s handling of Sweatland would be viewed as a slap on the wrist. “A court-martial convicted and punished Lt. Col. Sweatland under adherence to the rules and procedures prescribed by the Uniform Code of Military Justice. We have no further comment on this matter while it is subject to appellate review,” Lessard said.\\n\\nUpdate 2/9: This article was updated with more information from U.S. Army Cadet Command spokesperson Maj. Dan Lessard and the subhed has been changed to reflect this information.'},\n",

The incident in question involves fentanyl-laced pages that may have killed a mailroom supervisor.\\n\\nAt the high-security US Penitentiary in Atwater, an inmate named Jamar Jones was allegedly sent mail from his ex-girlfriend Stephanie Ferreira and a man called Jersey Rudd III. Prosecutors say that multiple pages of the letter were “soaked” in drugs—including amphetamines, fentanyl, and “spice,” or synthetic cannabinoids, according to drug testing. They say the paper looked like it was dipped in wax.\\n\\nVideos by VICE\\n\\nThe senders attempted to conceal the alleged drug shipment by sending it via “legal mail,” meant to be confidentially between an attorney and inmate. All three have been charged for conspiracy to distribute.\\n\\nAccording to an FBI affidavit, the mailroom supervisor, Marc Fischer, came in contact with the envelope and handled its pages. Within five minutes, he began stumbling around and told coworkers he was “having trouble breathing.” Fellow corrections officers called for medical support, and after two hours and a trip to the hospital, Fischer died.\\n\\nThe cause of death is still unknown and won’t be identified until toxicology reports are finalized. Secondhand fentanyl exposure shouldn’t be fatal, experts say.\\n\\nThis is hardly the first case of drug-soaked mail in prisons. In 2019, 122 federal prisons began photocopying inmate letters instead of giving them the originals in an attempt to stop the distribution of any drug concealed in mail or postage.

       "   'content': 'CNN —\\n\\nThe Trump administration has halted efforts to place migrants in tent structures built at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, amid concerns that the emerging facilities don’t meet detention standards because they lack air conditioning or electricity, a US official and a source familiar with the matter told CNN.\\n\\nIt comes weeks after officials scrambled to set up additional housing for migrants at the controversial US base on the island — and only days after those on location were deported. While the tent structures are currently not being used, migrants are still being placed in the detention facility on the base, and at the Migrant Operations Center, or MOC.\\n\\nThe Trump administration said it would be building out tent structures at Guantanamo Bay to house an anticipated 30,000 people transferred there from the southern border. But the sources said Monday that the tents don’t currently meet detention standards set by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The two sources, and a third US official, also said there haven’t been enough people transferred to the base to justify building more.\\n\\nThe situation is indicative of the harried efforts undertaken by the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security to house migrants at the naval base, after President Donald Trump ordered the move in January. Sources previously told CNN the mission has been embroiled in confusion and conflicting internal messaging over who is in charge and what will happen to migrants once they arrive.\\n\\nThe Pentagon referred questions to US Southern Command.\\n\\n“There should have been a greater degree of planning before the execution. Now execution has begun, and everyone is trying to back into planning,” a source with knowledge of the situation previously told CNN.\\n\\nLast week, more than 170 migrants at the naval base were flown to Venezuela, nearly emptying Guantanamo. Since then, 17 migrants have been brought to the detention facility portion of the base, the official said.\\n\\nThere are no migrants currently being housed at the MOC and no flights with more migrants expected over the next two days. There are currently roughly 1,000 US service members supporting the mission at Guantanamo.\\n\\nOne of the US officials told CNN that there is a cap of 50 for how many migrants can be brought to the MOC to avoid an overflow of people, which would require them to be placed in the tents, largely because the tents do not meet detention standards set by ICE — which is the agency in charge of the migrants.\\n\\nBut there also haven’t been enough migrants coming to Guantanamo yet to justify building more tents for them, the two US officials said.\\n\\n“Depending on how many people we get, they may be trickled down to the tents, but at this moment we haven’t reached that threshold to put people in tents,” one of the officials said.\\n\\nIt has been unclear how officials are determining who is sent to Guantanamo; one source previously told CNN that all have been deemed to have what was described as “criminality.” A senior Homeland Security official told CNN that while some are “violent gang members and other high-threat illegal aliens,” others are “illegal aliens with final deportation orders.”\\n\\n“All these individuals committed a crime by entering the United States illegally,” the senior DHS official said.\\n\\nCNN reported that of the 177 Venezuelan migrants flown to their home country out of Guantanamo last week, 126 people had criminal charges or convictions, while 51 had no criminal record.'},\n",

He said he was “perfectly aware that these wounds cannot be erased or healed” and he was ready to “take responsibility” for his actions.\\n\\nAlmost all the children were unaware of the alleged abuse until police knocked at their doors having discovered their names in the handwritten “black books” found at Le Scouarnec’s home.\\n\\nThe abuse is alleged to have taken place between 1989 and 2014, when Le Scouarnec worked at more than a dozen private and public hospitals in Brittany and other parts of western France.\\n\\nIn 2017, neighbours in Jonzac, north of Bordeaux, reported Le Scouarnec to police. In 2020, he was convicted for the rape or sexual assault of four children, including a young hospital patient. He was sentenced to 15 years and is currently in prison.\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Campaigners outside the courthouse in Vannes on Monday as the trial opened.

Officers also discovered a collection of dolls, some lifesize, under the floorboards.\\n\\nIn one note, Le Scouarnec is alleged to have written: “I am a paedophile and I always will be.”\\n\\nThe trial, which is expected to last four months, will also focus on how Le Scouarnec was allowed to continue operating on children despite having been convicted and given a four-month suspended sentence for possessing child sexual abuse images in 2005.\\n\\nHis employers and the professional body for doctors, L’Ordre des Médecins, were informed, as was the French ministry of health. No action was taken.\\n\\nMore than 60 lawyers are representing the victims and their families, who will give evidence next month in the chronological order in which the abuse is alleged to have taken place. Two hundred and fifty-six of the victims were under 15, with the youngest aged one and the oldest 70.\\n\\nOne of Le Scouarnec’s lawyers, Maxime Tessier, told the court his client admitted to the “vast majority” of the charges. Le Scouarnec’s former wife and his three children are expected to give evidence on Tuesday. Other members of the surgeon’s family will be questioned the following day.\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Maxime Tessier, one of Le Scouarnec’s lawyers, told the court his client admitted to the ‘vast majority’ of the charges.

       "   'time': '2025-02-24T17:40:11',\n",
       "   'content': 'Ninety cases of measles have been reported in Texas in less than a month, marking the worst outbreak of the disease in the border state in more than 30 years. At least 16 people have been admitted to the hospital. Nine cases of measles have also been reported in the neighboring state of New Mexico.\\n\\nAccording to officials at the Texas Department of State Health Services, the outbreak has been concentrated in the northwest of the state. At least 77 of these cases are in children, with 26 being 4 years old or younger.\\n\\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral disease that can be deadly. Early symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, and conjunctivitis. It is usually distinguished by white spots on the inside of the mouth as well as a generalized rash all over the body.\\n\\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organization, measles once killed 2.6 million people a year worldwide, with 12,000 of these victims being in the Americas. The first measles vaccine arrived in 1963, and following its rollout in the US, cases across the country fell by 97 percent between 1965 and 1968. Massive worldwide vaccination campaigns then spread these gains across the globe. Between 1980 and 2015, worldwide cases fell by 95 percent thanks to the combined vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), which is given in two doses starting at 1 year of age.\\n\\nHowever, skepticism about the effects of vaccines, including MMR, has spread throughout the world. For example, the current outbreak in Texas has centered around Gaines County, which has one of the highest vaccine exemption rates in the state (18 percent). Many of the patients are children whose parents chose not to immunize them against measles.\\n\\nWhile most states in the US require students to have the MMR vaccine to attend school, some states allow families to request an exemption from vaccination for their children, even for nonmedical reasons. Texas is one such state. In the current outbreak, 85 of the 90 measles cases are in unvaccinated people.\\n\\n“We respect everyone’s right to get vaccinated or not,” Albert Pilkington, CEO of the Seminole Hospital District in Gaines Country, told the Texas Standard. “That’s what being an American is all about, isn’t it?”\\n\\nIn 2024, 285 measles cases were reported in the United States, the highest number since 2019. Forty-two percent were children under the age of 5.\\n\\nThe outlook for preventing this disease is not bright. The measles outbreak in Texas comes just a week after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was confirmed as head of the US Department of Health and Human Services. RFK Jr. rose to prominence first as an environmental advocate and then as a notorious anti-vaccine activist.\\n\\nKennedy has repeatedly spread vaccine misinformation—for example, that autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are caused by, among other factors, harmful agents in vaccines. In 2021 he was named by the Center for Countering Digital Hate as one of the “Disinformation Dozen”—one of 12 leading online anti-vaxxers.\\n\\nNeither Robert F. Kennedy Jr. nor Texas governor Greg Abbott have commented on the state’s health emergency. Neither responded immediately to a request for comment from WIRED.\\n\\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED en Español and has been translated from Spanish.'}],\n",

       "   'title': 'Five key takeaways from the German election',\n",
       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': 'Five key takeaways from the German election\\n\\n2 hours ago Paul Kirby Europe digital editor in Berlin\\n\\nBBC\\'s Nick Beake reports from AfD headquarters in Berlin\\n\\nFriedrich Merz\\'s conservatives have won, but Germany\\'s 2025 election has thrown up some important and fascinating stories that reveal a country in flux. Alternative for Germany, or AfD, has doubled its support in just four years to 20.8%, and has spread out from its support base in the east to become the second biggest political force in parliament. Meanwhile, outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz\\'s SPD had its worst performance in decades, only securing 16.4% of the vote. Here are five key takeaways.\\n\\nAfD dominant in east, spreading to the west\\n\\nLook at an election results map of Germany, and you could almost have travelled back in time to the Cold War, when an iron curtain divided communist East Germany from the west. In the east it\\'s a swathe of AfD light blue, apart from pockets like Berlin and half of Leipzig. In the west the vast majority has turned conservative black, especially in Bavaria where Merz\\'s conservative sister party, the CSU, dominates the landscape. But the AfD is spreading in the west too, and political loyalty to the old mainstream parties has gone. For one in five Germans it has become normalised. \"They\\'re just normal people,\" said one young man of immigrant origin in Duisburg, a city in western Germany\\'s old industrial heartland.\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\nEven though it came second, the AfD is blocked from being part of the next government because of a \"firewall\" - or Brandmauer - operated by Germany\\'s main parties, who do not co-operate with any party seen as extremist since the end of World War Two. The AfD\\'s leader Alice Weidel insists it is a libertarian, conservative movement, not racist. Its big increase in public support has coincided with a series of deadly attacks in the past nine months, all allegedly by immigrants. The AfD has embraced a highly controversial policy called \"remigration\", which it defines as deporting migrants who have committed crimes. But the term can also refer to the mass deportation of migrants and their descendants. In May 2024 a German court rejected an AfD appeal against a ruling classifying it as a suspected far-right extremist organisation. Judges found that the AfD had \"positions that disparage the democratic order and are incompatible with the principle of democracy\". In three German states in the east - Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony - domestic intelligence has designated the AfD as right-wing extremist. A leading AfD figure in Thuringia, Björn Höcke, has twice been convicted of using a banned Nazi slogan \"Alles für Deutschland\" - everything for Germany. Alice Weidel supporters have chanted her name during the election campaign, using the phrase \"Alice für Deutschland\".\\n\\nGermans voted in biggest turnout for 40 years\\n\\nNot since 1987 has turnout been as high as 82.5% in a German election, and that was three years before reunification of east and west. Four years ago it was 76.6%. Put simply, more than four in every five of Germany\\'s 59.2 million voters turned out. It reflects just how energised Germans have been by this election, which comes at a pivotal moment for their country. There were nine TV debates in the final stretch of the campaign, but that reflected the broad interest of the audience.\\n\\nAll over for leaders of collapsed government\\n\\nThe three-party government of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz fell apart at the end of last year, and within 24 hours of Sunday\\'s election, all three leaders have said they\\'re leaving the front line of politics. The leader of the economic liberals, the FDP, was first. Christian Lindner has led his party for 11 years. But it failed to get any MPs elected and Lindner has said he\\'s leaving politics after 25 years. It was Lindner\\'s refusal to compromise on debt rules that first brought the government down, and then sent his party into the wilderness. Although Scholz will remain as chancellor until the next government is formed, he won\\'t be taking part in coalition talks and will be leaving frontline politics. Greens Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck is also leaving frontline politics after his party fell below 12% in the election.\\n\\nTikTok generation hauls Left back from dead\\n\\nUntil a few weeks ago, the Left party looked doomed when one of its leading lights, Sahra Wagenknecht, went off and founded her own, more populist, party with eight other MPs. Wagenknecht\\'s popularity soared for a while as head of her BSW party, but ultimately fell just below the 5% threshold for getting into parliament. The story was very different for the Left (Die Linke), which came back from the dead with an inspired social medial campaign. Heidi Reichinnek, Die Linke\\'s co-chair, went viral after she gave a speech enthusiastically defending the firewall against the AfD. She now has 580,000 followers on TikTok and her post has attracted seven million views. Her party secured just under 9% of the vote.\\n\\nGetty Images Heidi Reichinnek\\'s viral video from the Bundestag has helped revive her party\\n\\nYoung go left and right, old stick to centre'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Isar Aerospace, a German startup founded seven years ago, is positioned to become the first in a new generation of European launch companies to reach orbit with a privately funded rocket.\\n\\nThe company announced Friday that the first stage of its Spectrum rocket recently completed a 30-second test-firing on a launch pad in the northernmost reaches of mainland Europe. The nine-engine booster ignited on a launch pad at Andøya Spaceport in Norway on February 14.\\n\\nThe milestone follows a similar test-firing of the Spectrum rocket\\'s second stage last year. With these two accomplishments, Isar Aerospace says its launch vehicle is qualified for flight.\\n\\n\"We are almost ready for the test flight. All we need is the license,\" said Daniel Metzler, co-founder and CEO of Isar Aerospace. \"By enabling space access from mainland Europe, we provide a critical resource for ensuring sovereignty and resilience.\"\\n\\nAside from the normal preparations for a rocket launch—such as mating the two stages of the launcher together and integrating its payload fairing—the primary hurdle remaining for Isar is regulatory in nature. In a statement, Isar said the first flight of the Spectrum rocket will take place \"as soon as possible\" following approval and licensing from the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority.\\n\\nOfficials will set the exact launch period during the licensing process, according to Tina Schmitt, an Isar spokesperson.\\n\\nThe fully assembled Spectrum rocket will stand about 92 feet (28 meters) tall and measure more than 6 feet (2 meters) in diameter. The expendable launcher is designed to haul payloads up to 1 metric ton (2,200 pounds) into low-Earth orbit. Spectrum is powered by nine Aquila engines on its first stage, and one engine on the second stage, burning a mixture of propane and liquid oxygen propellants.\\n\\nFinish line in sight\\n\\nNamed for the Bavarian river, Isar is headquartered near Munich, a hub of the European space industry home to facilities owned by the German space agency and Airbus. Metzler co-founded Isar with two engineering classmates at Technical University Munich in 2018. The company says it has raised more than 400 million euros (about $420 million), more than any other European launch startup. It is primarily backed by venture capital, but it secured an investment from the NATO Innovation Fund last year.'},\n",

       "   'title': \"What’s Next After Merz's Conservatives Win German Election\",\n",
       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': 'It is salutary to remember that the man set to take over Germany has not had any role in government. Friedrich Merz, whose Christian Democrats won a comfortable if unconvincing victory in Sunday’s elections, will form a government at a time of tumult on multiple fronts.\\n\\nHe faces an economy reeling from a decade of under-investment and entering its third year of recession, an immigration crisis exacerbated by a series of lone terror attacks, and the ever-growing popularity of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). Most of all it is facing the unprecedented collapse of relations with the U.S., on whom Germans have relied on for security since the end of World War Two.\\n\\nRead More: Exclusive: Alice Weidel on Her Far-Right AfD Party’s Rise, Elon Musk’s Support, and the German Election\\n\\nMerz would see himself as a classic Conservative of the old school, somewhere perhaps between Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, a believer in traditional social values and the established security and political architecture of the postwar era that has bound Germans into the Transatlantic alliance.\\n\\nWhen Donald Trump was re-elected U.S. President in November, Merz was confident he could do business with him—two fist-pumping men who wanted to slash bureaucracy, cut taxes, and wage war on “woke.” Yet the confrontational approach of Trump’s lieutenants at the recent Munich Security Conference—in which they lauded praise on the AfD—has changed that.\\n\\nThe 69-year-old Merz—a man who has interspersed politics with boardroom life as Chairman of the German arm of Blackrock, the investment house—is keen not to waste time. As he made clear during his victory speech, “the world isn’t waiting for us.” Germany, he added, could not spend months haggling over the finer points of a coalition agreement while Ukraine’s fate is decided by Trump and the man whom they feel has captured him, Russia’s Vladimir Putin.\\n\\nKaja Kallas, the E.U.’s chief diplomat, reiterated that point, expressing the hope that a new government is formed “as quickly as possible, as we really need to move on with decisions at the European level which requires German participation.”\\n\\nWith Emmanuel Macron in Washington today, and Keir Starmer following on Thursday, Europe is seeking to persuade Trump to step back from his seeming endorsement of Putin’s Ukraine position. Both the French and British leaders have been coordinating their positions, stressing the need for quiet diplomacy. But within hours of securing his election victory, Merz appeared to take a more confrontational approach toward the White House.\\n\\n“My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,” Merz said Sunday, before even the final election tally came in.\\n\\nSome wondered whether this might be another example of an impetuousness that is seen, even by his confidants, as a weak spot in Merz’s character. Yet he doubled down on his position the following morning: “Now more than ever, we must put Ukraine in a position of strength. For a just peace, the attacked country must be part of peace negotiations.”\\n\\nFor such talk to have substance, Merz will have to show that he is prepared to borrow more to ramp up Germany’s defense budget. A decade after NATO members agreed to devote a minimum of 2% of GDP for military spending, Germany only reached that target in 2024. In order to increase it to 2.5%, let alone a new 3% target, will cost tens of billions. For that, the incoming government will have to reform its so-called “debt brake” that places stringent limits on public debt.\\n\\nIt seems that Merz is prepared to do that, with the support of the center-left Social Democrats. The outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s SPD suffered a humiliating result, falling into third place to a historic low. They are now expected to play a junior role in a center-right administration. Yet some of Merz’s agenda will be hard for it to accede to, particularly elements of his economic reform package such as welfare cuts and tax breaks, and his plans to crack down hard on illegal migration.\\n\\nIn one respect, the row with Trump makes Merz’s task harder; it is a warning to mainstream on the politicians on both the left and right of what may follow if they fail to form a durable coalition. Encouraged by its best-ever result, with 20% of the vote, and boosted by the boisterous support of Elon Musk and others in the Trump Administration, the AfD is waiting in the wings. It is preparing a second front of attack the moment the new government faces its next crisis.\\n\\nThe far-right in Germany is confident that its moment will come, again.'},\n",

       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': 'New German leader signals seismic shift in transatlantic relations\\n\\n11 hours ago Katya Adler Europe editor Reporting from Berlin\\n\\nGetty Images Friedrich Merz says he is eager to re-engage with international partners\\n\\nGermany\\'s chancellor-in-waiting didn\\'t wait for the final results of his country\\'s election on Sunday to herald a new era in Europe. Declaring the US indifferent to this continent\\'s fate, Friedrich Merz questioned the future of Nato and demanded Europe boost its own defences. Quickly. This tone from the close US ally - and from Friedrich Merz who is known to be a passionate Atlanticist - would have been unimaginable even a couple of months ago. It\\'s a seismic shift. That may read like hyperbole, but what we are now experiencing in terms of transatlantic relations is unprecedented in the 80 years since the end of World War Two.\\n\\nBig European powers have been shocked to the core by the Trump administration, which suggests it could revoke the security guarantees to Europe in place since 1945. \"I would never have thought that I would have to say something like this in a TV show but, after Donald Trump\\'s remarks last week... it is clear that this government does not care much about the fate of Europe,\" Friedrich Merz said during a post-election debate on Sunday. Germany\\'s conservatives celebrate, but far right enjoy record result \"My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,\" he added. Merz hinted that the endeavour was so urgent that he was not sure on whether the transatlantic alliance leaders gathering for a summit in June \"would still be talking about Nato in its current form or whether we will have to establish an independent European defence capability much more quickly\". Significantly, the forthcoming chancellor put Donald Trump\\'s America on a par with Russia - widely viewed here as a security threat to Europe more broadly. \"We are under such massive pressure from two sides that my absolute priority now really is to create unity in Europe,\" Merz said. The UK prime minister heads to Washington on Thursday, following the visit there on Monday by French President Emmanuel Macron. Friedrich Merz admits, indirectly, to a sense of Fomo - fear of missing out. By rights Germany should be there, too, this week, he says. Berlin, is one of Europe\\'s Big Three powers, alongside France and the UK. And with the US and Russia now pow-wowing bilaterally, about, but not with, Ukraine, it feels like a global return to big-power politics. But Germany has been MIA [missing in action] for a good while now on the European and the world stage. The outgoing government here was weakened and distracted by vicious internal bickering. This infuriated German voters - who wanted urgent focus on the economy and migration - and European allies, demanding action on Russia, security and defence. Merz says a top priority for Germany is to re-engage internationally. The country is already the second-biggest donor of military aid to Ukraine, after the US. Merz wants to continue that support, but, unlike France and the UK, he\\'s been reticent about the idea of sending soldiers to Ukraine, to back up an eventual ceasefire there. Based on Germany\\'s track record though - it dragged its heels at every stage of Ukraine support, and despite that, ended up delivering more aid than any of its European neighbours - a \\'No\\' now, doesn\\'t mean a \\'No\\' forever to committing troops or participating in whatever form a European \"reassurance force\" in Ukraine may take.\\n\\nFor now, the soldiers Germans most worry about are the 35,000 American ones, stationed in their country, that make them feel safe. It\\'s highly unusual for foreign policy to be a top voter concern at election time. But in Germany this weekend, alongside the economy and migration, voter after voter said they worried about peace in Europe and felt very insecure. Back in November, Germany\\'s interior ministry said it was drawing up a list of bunkers that could provide emergency shelter for civilians. Ukraine may be far away, but Germans feel at great risk from Russia for two reasons. Firstly, the amount of military equipment their country has sent Ukraine. The far right, Alternative for Germany (AfD), with its \"Germany First\" slogan, campaigned for Berlin to disengage from Kyiv and to re-establish relations with Russia. A strategy not unlike Donald Trump\\'s, as the party is fond of pointing out. Secondly, many in Germany think that if Russia wanted to really destabilise Europe, it might be tempted to strike one of the Big Three with a long-range missile.\\n\\nGetty Images German voters worry about security in Europe - including the future of the 35,000 American soldiers stationed in Germany'},\n",

During that break, he often travelled for business to the United States and China, though he never lived outside Germany.\\n\\n\"Friedrich Merz is perhaps the most international chancellor Germany has had since the war — if he becomes chancellor,\" said Volker Resing, who wrote the recently published biography \"Friedrich Merz: His Path to Power.\"\\n\\nMerz \"relies on personal initiative, on the freedom of the individual, on creativity and motivation. And only secondarily on the state,\" Resing said.\\n\\nMerz launched his political comeback after Merkel stepped down as CDU leader in 2018 and announced that she wouldn\\'t seek a fifth term of chancellor. However, he was narrowly defeated by centrist candidates more in Merkel\\'s mold in party leadership votes in 2018 and early 2021.\\n\\nMerz persisted and was elected party leader in the third attempt, after the center-right\\'s defeat by current Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Germany\\'s 2021 election. Merz cemented his power by also becoming the leader of the Union\\'s parliamentary group.\\n\\nAccording to Resing, Merz\\'s \"way of doing politics\" is not to avoid confrontation at all costs. Instead, he maintains a perspective that \"a certain amount of provocation can set off a real debate and perhaps a real development in motion.\"\\n\\nDuring the election campaign, Merz has vowed to make Germany\\'s ailing economy strong again and curb irregular migration.\\n\\nWith President Trump back in the White House and tensions rising over how to resolve the war in Ukraine, Merz, who has long supported a strong trans-Atlantic relationship, said after his victory that his top priority is to unify Europe in the face of challenges coming from the United States and Russia.\\n\\n\"I have no illusions at all about what is happening from America,\" he told supporters. \"We are under such massive pressure ... my absolute priority now is really to create unity in Europe.\"\\n\\nMerz will be under pressure to help solve some of Europe\\'s most urgent problems, according to Wolfgang Merkel, a political analyst from the WBZ Berlin Social Science Center, but \"we shouldn\\'t expect to hear one voice out of Brussels.\"\\n\\n\"The interests are so different within the European Union, including the political majorities, that we shouldn\\'t expect a resounding common EU policy,\" he said and added that it will likely \"be the usual game of muddling through.\"\\n\\nMerz put toughening Germany\\'s immigration laws at the forefront of the election campaign after a migrant killed two people in a knife attack in the Bavarian city of Aschaffenburg last month.\\n\\nHe brought a nonbinding motion before the parliament, calling for many more migrants to be turned back at Germany\\'s borders. The motion was narrowly approved thanks to votes from the far-right AfD party.\\n\\nThat prompted his opponents to accuse Merz of breaking a taboo in allegedly working with the AfD, and a public rebuke from Merkel. Critics pointed to the episode as an illustration of what they say is Merz\\'s tendency to impulsiveness.\\n\\nSince then, hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets to protest against both Merz\\'s motion and also the rise of the far right, like the AfD, which has been placed under surveillance for suspected extremism by German intelligence.\\n\\nDuring the campaign, the AfD\\'s leader, Alice Weidel, pledged to carry out the mass deportation of immigrants, outraging many Germans.\\n\\n\"We know what happened in Germany in the \\'30s, and it feels a bit like this is happening again, and this makes me really afraid of the future,\" one protester in Berlin said.\\n\\nMerz has insisted he did nothing wrong and never worked with AfD, and also repeatedly vowed to never work with the party if he becomes chancellor.\\n\\nMerz represents his rural region in Germany\\'s parliament — an area where people are \"rather down-to-earth, perhaps a little reserved,\" Resing said. \"That\\'s what shaped him: rural life.\"\\n\\nAs a politician, Merz has always championed conservative values and stressed the importance of family.\\n\\nHe met his wife Charlotte, who is now a judge, while he was studying law.

       "   'content': 'UPDATE (Feb. 23, 2025, 4:10 p.m. ET): As of Sunday afternoon, exit polls project the center-right CDU party has garnered the largest vote share in Germany, making Friedrich Merz the likely next chancellor. The far-right AfD party surged into second place overall, but its role in a coalition government remains unclear.\\n\\nThe future of the European Union’s anchor nation is on the line this Sunday as German voters head to the polls to elect a new parliament, the Bundestag, which will eventually choose the nation’s next chancellor.\\n\\nThis year’s election includes some surprise (and unwelcome) American cameos, however. Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance have been trying to throw their weight around and maybe even influence the election’s outcome. For months, Musk has been campaigning from afar for Alice Weidel, leader of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, which embraces anti-immigration, anti-Muslim, anti-Ukraine and anti-establishment sentiment.\\n\\nElon Musk and Vice President JD Vance have been trying to throw their weight around and maybe even influence the election’s outcome.\\n\\n“Only the AfD can save Germany,” Musk proclaimed recently as he hosted a 74-minute conversation on his X social media platform.\\n\\nEarlier this month, Vance made a point of meeting one on one with Weidel at the Munich Security Conference, reportedly discussing Ukraine, German politics and the “firewall of the right” that has prevented far-right parties from joining coalition governments. Vance declined to meet with center-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\\n\\nFriedrich Merz’s center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party has the polling edge, but surging into second place is AfD with around 20%. Scholz’s Social Democrats (SPD) have fallen to third place. The result is still likely to be a coalition of parties. The problem? Merz wants to keep AfD out, while Musk, Vance and Donald Trump want it in.\\n\\nHow many votes does this trio command? My fear is that the Americans have more of a following in Germany than they deserve, and are appealing to voters unenthusiastic about Germany’s current direction.\\n\\nIndeed, Musk has only been stoking such fears on X and in interviews. Far-right websites have seized on his comments, as well as his recent activities by Trump’s side. Capitalizing on fears in the wake of recent terrorist attacks in Germany, he has claimed that foreigners are behind crime increases. “Wow,” he commented in January, on an X post falsely claiming Afghans and Pakistanis are proportionally 16 times more likely to be involved in rape than German citizens.\\n\\nWorryingly, younger voters have little (or no) memory of the Cold War, when the United States and Western Europe stood together in solidarity against the threat of Soviet tanks pouring through the Fulda Gap and across the Rhine. Many of today’s Germans are more anxious about their faltering economy, pushing to resume the flow of cheap Russian gas — now cut off by a Europe-wide boycott — and calling for an end to Russian sanctions. Both points are planks of the AfD platform. And then there’s fear that Trump tariffs on everything from autos to pharmaceuticals could prove paralyzing. A chilling thought, but potentially less likely with a Trump-friendly AfD in charge.\\n\\nA less democratically minded German leader will make it much harder for other E.U. countries to resist Washington.\\n\\nIn contrast, Merz has already told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy he’s prepared to give him what he needs to win. The Ukrainian president has praised both Merz and current leader Scholz as “great guys.”\\n\\nWhoever does emerge as the next chancellor will have to decide how deeply Germany will support democracy and freedom in Ukraine — and how resolutely it will stand up to challenges and threats from both Trump and President Vladimir Putin in Russia. The rest of Europe will of course be watching all of this very closely. A less democratically minded German leader will make it much harder for other European Union countries to resist Washington.\\n\\nThe U.S. can and should deal with the new German government, whatever it looks like. And perhaps the Trump administration will eventually remember why strong alliances only enhance American prosperity and power.\\n\\nThe hope is that German voters will recognize where their best interests lie, as well.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"BERLIN — Germany woke Monday to the aftermath of a bruising election in which the center-right conservatives won the most votes and far-right nationalists surged to huge gains, causing dismay in a country deeply wary of its Nazi past.\\n\\nThe Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which is under surveillance by German intelligence over suspected far-right extremism, experienced its largest-ever share of the vote, garnering the support of Elon Musk and others in the Trump administration.\\n\\nThe White House’s alleged interference in the run-up to the vote sparked unusually fierce criticism from Friedrich Merz, the leader of the victorious Christian Democratic Union, who will lead coalition talks to form Germany's next government.\\n\\nMerz told supporters at a party event in Berlin on Sunday night: “I have no illusions at all about what is happening from America. Take a look at the recent interventions in the German election campaign by Mr. Elon Musk.”\\n\\nGerman conservative candidate and Christian Democratic Union party leader Friedrich Merz in Berlin on Sunday. Fabrizio Bensch / Reuters\\n\\nIf Merz, who said Monday that he plans to quickly form Germany's next government, does become the next chancellor, then his in tray will be bursting.\\n\\nDomestically, he would have to deal with widespread unrest over immigration at home, fueled by a spate of high-profile attacks in recent weeks and a flagging economy. That might be harder after the AfD and the radical Left Party won enough seats to block constitutional changes needed to loosen state borrowing limits — changes economists say are essential to reviving growth.\\n\\nInternationally, Merz would have to navigate the fraying bond between Washington and Europe, of which Germany is the most populous country and biggest economy. There is also the matter of the war in Ukraine, over which the AfD and radical Left's sway may also stymie raising Germany's defense and military aid budget.\\n\\nAll the while, Merz would have one eye on the far right, which has been surging across Europe while enjoying mutual support from President Donald Trump and his aides.\\n\\nMusk has previously endorsed the AfD, hosting party events on the X social media platform that he owns and appearing at a campaign rally during which he repeated one of the party’s most controversial points of view, which is that young Germans should no longer feel guilty for the events of the Holocaust in their country’s past.\\n\\nAlice Weidel, co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, in Berlin on Monday. Andreas Rentz / Getty Images\\n\\nMerz said Sunday that “the interventions from Washington were no less dramatic and drastic and ultimately outrageous than the interventions we have seen from Moscow. So we are under such massive pressure from two sides that my absolute priority now is really to create unity in Europe.”\\n\\nBy design, Germany’s voting system means it is very difficult for one party to govern alone, forcing leaders to work together and form coalitions to govern this consensus-based country. Merz said that he hoped to form a government by Easter, but added that cooperating with the second-placed AfD was “completely out of the question.”\\n\\nGermany’s political establishment has long maintained an informal “firewall” against cooperating with the far right that is seen as a bulwark against fascism.\\n\\nMerz’s CDU party won 28.5% of the vote and 208 of the 630 seats in Germany’s parliament, according to results that are set to be validated by lawmakers March 15.\\n\\nThe AfD won 20.5% and 152 seats, while the ruling center-left Social Democratic Party fell to 15.5% and 120 seats. Chancellor Olaf Scholz has been effectively voted out of office, calling the interventions by Washington “disgusting” Sunday.\\n\\nThe environmentally focused Greens got 11.6% and 85 seats, and the leftist Die Linke party received 8.8% and 64 seats, while the pro-business Free Democrats and left-wing populist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance failed to meet the 5% threshold that would allow them to enter parliament.\"},\n",

       "   'content': \"1 Salah easily outshines De Bruyne\\n\\nKevin De Bruyne and Mohamed Salah have mirrored each other as leading men in the Premier League. They even share the status of being discarded by Chelsea, but Sunday’s match may be where their paths finally diverge. Salah delivered a goal and an assist while De Bruyne was a shock selection, unused by Manchester City in Madrid. On Friday Pep Guardiola hinted the Belgian’s time at the club was done. If Sunday was a last hurrah, De Bruyne misfiring passes and chasing shadows was a brutal reminder of how time catches up with even the very best. Where the Belgian exhibits physical decline from sheer miles on the clock, Salah, just a year younger, played to his peak, often buzz-sawing into midfield areas De Bruyne once commanded. The Egyptian king’s contract situation remains at an impasse, the sense being he awaits the right offer from Liverpool. De Bruyne may now be reduced to mere cameos as Guardiola rebuilds, a sad coda. John Brewin\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Mohamed Salah with Dominik Szoboszlai after setting up Liverpool’s second goal at City. Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/Reuters\\n\\n2 Arsenal lose heads in costly defeat\\n\\nYou could sense the anxiety creeping in at the Emirates on Saturday before Jarrod Bowen scored what proved to be the winner for West Ham. That had only increased by the time Mikel Arteta hauled off Declan Rice and Riccardo Calafiori after 10 minutes of the second half, with Myles Lewis-Skelly lasting 17 minutes from the bench before being sent off. It was the fifth red card for Arsenal this season in the Premier League – two more than anyone else – and once again contributed to them dropping points as they desperately try to make up ground on Liverpool. Arsenal’s lack of composure this season when they go behind or are reduced to 10 men may prove to be their downfall and Arteta will hope they can regroup in time for the crucial trip to Nottingham Forest on Wednesday evening. “We have to keep going, still many points to play for,” said the captain, Martin Ødegaard. “We can’t feel sorry for ourselves and have to learn from this.” Ed Aarons\\n\\n3 United face long road back to elite\\n\\nManchester United club staff, some with decades of loyal service, have lost their jobs for this? Cost-cutting by Sir Jim Ratcliffe is not going to re-establish the club among the elite any time soon, given how far they have fallen behind and how onerous the task confronting Ruben Amorim is. Everton should have condemned Amorim’s team to a third consecutive league defeat long before they were left bewildered by the 96th-minute penalty incident. The video assistant referee’s failure to show Matthijs de Ligt’s shirt-pull on Ashley Young to referee Andrew Madley on the pitchside monitor, and to instead focus purely on Harry Maguire’s tussle with the veteran, was inexplicable. It was a huge let-off for United and Amorim, who again spoke of needing to “survive this season” before planning ahead. “We have so many problems,” he added. A squad unsuited to its manager’s requirements is one of them, and United do not have the resources for the extensive rebuild needed. It is a long way back from here. Andy Hunter\\n\\n4 Maresca searching for net gain\\n\\nEnzo Maresca stopped short of saying Filip Jörgensen would keep his place after the goalkeeper’s howler gifted Aston Villa victory. Maresca dropped Robert Sánchez last month after a series of errors but now the Chelsea manager must decide whether to restore him in goal against Southampton on Tuesday. With Kepa Arrizabalaga and Djordje Petrovic out on loan, third-choice Marcus Bettinelli – whose only appearance for the club was more than three years ago – is Maresca’s other option. Jörgensen made a couple of smart stops at Villa Park, chiefly to deny the substitute Donyell Malen before the corner that led to Marco Asensio’s winner, but his error ultimately cost Chelsea. Asked if he would keep faith with the 22-year-old, Maresca replied: “I don’t know. It’s not [because of] today’s mistake that I’m going to change the idea about Filip. This is a moment where we need to support each other and continue to work hard.” Ben Fisher\\n\\nView image in fullscreen The Chelsea goalkeeper Filip Jörgensen saves a shot by Ollie Watkins of Aston Villa.

Over the past six months he has visibly matured from an uncertain, almost ephemeral presence to a player of real substance, a tireless runner and aggressive tackler but also a passer of genuine quality; his pass completion rate against Ipswich was 85%. Saturday was only the 19-year-old’s seventh start in the league, although he has been picking up experience in the Carabao Cup and the Europa League, but he is already an assured figure alongside Rodrigo Bentancur. Ange Postecoglou’s preferred midfield at the moment appears to be Bergvall and Bentancur plus a creator. There hasn’t been much good to come out of this season for Tottenham but it may be that, in time, the case hardening of their fleet of teenagers will work to their advantage. Jonathan Wilson\\n\\n6 Howe’s boss sees Newcastle hang on\\n\\nEddie Howe might have chosen a different performance for the Newcastle chair, Yasir al-Rumayyan, to witness after flying from Riyadh. Although his team beat Nottingham Forest 4-3 at St James’ Park they were clinging on at the end having led 4-1. “It was good to see the chairman but he might have heard a couple of swear words from me,” said Newcastle’s manager. “I think he was in the same sort of emotional state though.” Al-Rumayyan is also here for talks on whether Newcastle stay at a rebuilt St James’ Park or seek planning permission for a new home nearby. Several of Howe’s team may have retired by the time a new stadium is built, but do not bet against Lewis Miley having established himself as the star of England’s midfield.\\n\\nLouise Taylor\\n\\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it is certain that – to the presumed relief of Manchester United and West Ham – for the second consecutive year, the three promoted clubs are surely going back down. More troublingly still, at no point has there been much more than an outside chance that Ipswich, Leicester or Southampton might survive. Two seasons may be a small sample size, but with Leeds, Sheffield United and Burnley contesting the Championship’s automatic promotion slots, the sense is that the top division is increasingly hard to access and even harder to remain in. That is not the sign of a healthy competition. Daniel Harris\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Dejected Saints players during their latest heavy defeat. Photograph: Matt Watson/Southampton FC/Getty Images\\n\\n8 André a giant presence for Pereira\\n\\nVictory at Bournemouth was a coup for Vítor Pereira, with Wolves unrecognisable from the tactical anarchy that was often on display under Gary O’Neil. It also offered a blueprint for those looking to stop Andoni Iraola’s previously runaway train. Having Matheus Cunha certainly helped, the Brazilian a magnet for the ball in those moments when Wolves were relieving the pressure on the defence. His winning goal was the finish of a forward full of confidence, but another Brazilian, the midfielder André, was praised by his manager. “I give freedom to the other midfielders but André is the player who balances the space between the lines,” said Pereira. A star of the Fluminense team that won the 2023 Copa Libertadores, André was linked with moves to Manchester City and Liverpool only to pitch up at Molineux. His assimilation at Wolves has been gradual, but the player who had scouts flying to South America has begun to show what he can do. John Brewin\\n\\n9 Stylish Lacroix looks a steal for Palace\\n\\nMaxence Lacroix is a fine player. Tall, imposing and quick across the ground, the Crystal Palace defender was excellent during his side’s 2-0 win at Fulham. Raúl Jiménez was barely given a sniff of goal. The Fulham striker did break through when it was still 1-0 in the second half but he was denied by a superb covering challenge from Lacroix. It was expert defending and it is not a surprise that Palace are so difficult to break down on their travels. Their unbeaten away run in the Premier League stretches back to October and the foundations are laid by their solid back three. Chelsea cutting Trevoh Chalobah’s loan short has not made a difference. Chris Richards is doing well, Marc Guéhi is as smooth as ever and Lacroix, who joined from Wolfsburg last summer, looks a smart buy. Why were other teams not in for him? Jacob Steinberg\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Maxence Lacroix of Crystal Palace (right) celebrates after Daniel Muñoz scored to seal a 2-0 win at Fulham. Photograph: Molly Darlington/Getty Images\\n\\n10 Van Nistelrooy may have given up ghost\\n\\nIs Ruud van Nistelrooy positioning himself to avoid culpability if Leicester are relegated? The team have lost 11 of his 15 matches in charge in all competitions and their league goal difference mushroomed to -34 after Friday’s 4-0 home defeat by Brentford. Only one new player was bought in January, the full-back Woyo Coulibaly, and the manager’s post-match comments seemed to indicate he felt blame should fall beyond his players and, by extension, himself. “You have to look at performing at the maximum of your capabilities, I cannot ask the players to do more than that,” he said. “With the squad we have, it’s a huge, huge, huge mountain to climb to stay in this league.” It does feel like the former Manchester United player is covering his back. He signed a contract in November until June 2027 and it is doubtful the club would countenance sacking a second manager in a season – Steve Cooper lasted only five months – so the director of football, Jon Rudkin, and the owners may have a tough call to make in the summer.

       "   'content': \"In the final days of an election campaign dominated by migration, the likely new chancellor of Europe’s biggest polluter sought to assure voters that its economy ministry would not be occupied by NGOs. Instead, the conservative lead candidate Friedrich Merz posted on social media that it would be led by “someone who understands that economic policy is more than being a representative for heat pumps”.\\n\\nClimate action barely featured on the campaign trail before Germany’s federal elections on Sunday – except when right-leaning parties used it to swipe at the Greens. Merz’s jab was at the tamer end of attacks aimed at the Green party candidate, Robert Habeck, the economy and climate minister who pushed through an unpopular law to promote clean heating, but is a sign of how far the political conversation around climate action has shifted.\\n\\nCentre-right and far-right politicians have accused the Greens of turning Germany into an “eco-dictatorship” for policies that limit the burning of fossil fuels or require the public to change their behaviour. In a fiery speech the day before the election, Merz said he would do politics “for the majority who can think straight, and who also have all their marbles … and not for any green and leftwing nutcases”. Merz later said he was referring specifically to anti-rightwing protesters.\\n\\nIt is a far cry from the 2021 election, in which all parties bar the far-right AfD were keen to brandish their climate credentials by committing to cleaning up Germany’s economy by the middle of the century and keeping the planet from heating 1.5C (2.7F) above preindustrial levels.\\n\\nBy some measures, the Greens have survived a shift in German climate discourse that climate activists call a “witch-hunt”. They had a smaller drop in vote share than their former coalition partners, the market-liberal FDP and the centre-left SPD, despite years of political bashing and a decrease in public interest in climate action. They also lost fewer votes on Sunday than they did at the European elections last year, falling slightly from 15% to 12%.\\n\\nYet the result, which is likely to leave the Greens excluded from a future coalition, is further evidence that the green wave that swept Europe a few years ago was an outlier, rather than the new normal. Greens have been kicked out of government in Austria, Belgium and Ireland in recent months, echoing a recent trend of incumbents of all political stripes being punished at the polls. In Germany, young voters in particular abandoned the party in large numbers for the resurgent Die Linke (the Left), which won 1.2 million voters from the Greens and SPD.\\n\\nOn some counts, Die Linke’s climate policy is more ambitious than that of the Greens. The party wants Germany to reach climate neutrality by 2035 – in line with demands from activists such as Fridays for Future – and it emphasises the need for fairness in the energy transition. Snap analyses suggest its unexpected success was driven by targeting young progressives and running a highly successful social media campaign.\\n\\n“The Left focused on a progressive campaign centred around their core issues like rising rents and the high cost of living,” said Jessica Haak, a political scientist at the University of Hamburg. “This has also contributed to their relatively strong performance in urban centres, where the Greens typically receive substantial support.\\n\\n“In contrast, the Greens adopted a more moderate, centrist stance – especially regarding migration issues – which has sparked internal criticism, particularly from the party’s left wing.”\\n\\nAlthough climate played only a minor role in voting decisions, the outcome looks likely to slow the speed of Germany’s energy transition. The AfD, which surged into second place with 21% of the vote, openly denies the climate crisis. It has railed against other parties for following a “Left-Green” ideological agenda and its co-leader, Alice Weidel, recently described wind turbines as “windmills of shame”.\\n\\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

They have attacked the Greens heavily for efforts to phase out gas boilers and combustion engine cars, or reduce pollution on farms, and blamed them for the country’s economic struggles.\\n\\nAt a meeting in Berlin last month, the German conservatives drove a push from the centre-right European People’s party to rip up green finance laws and water down farming rules as part of their opposition to “excessive regulation and bureaucracy”.\\n\\nThe push to weaken climate and energy policy in the name of competitiveness could run afoul of Europe’s efforts to increase its independence from Russia, China and – as Merz said in an election debate on Sunday – the US.\\n\\nManon Dufour, head of the Brussels branch of climate thinktank E3G, said climate action would be a “core pillar” of any credible security and resilience strategy. She said: “Germany can act as an engine for Europe, helping forge a path towards security and resilience. It can also act as a brake, bringing it to a standstill.”\"},\n",

       "   'content': \"There has been talk in recent weeks about the rising levels of anxiety at Liverpool, a drop-off in their performance levels. Look at the number of draws, people have said. Is this a wobble? The club have won one league title since 1990 so a few nerves ought to come as standard.\\n\\nAnd yet, at the home of the soon‑to‑be‑deposed champions, when Liverpool had to win the match to clamp one hand firmly on the Premier League trophy – to take advantage of Arsenal’s shock home defeat by West Ham on Saturday – there was only assurance; a never-in-doubt result.\\n\\nA bit of context. Liverpool had entered the Etihad Stadium on an unbeaten league run of 22 matches. They have lost just once in the competition all season and not at all on their travels. They are not really wobbling. Perhaps their rivals just want to cling to something.\\n\\nThere was nothing for any of them here, certainly not Manchester City, who went with the kind of meekness that has been associated with them too often during this deep winter of discontent. The race feels run, Liverpool 11 points clear of Arsenal. Arne Slot’s team have simply been remorseless.\\n\\nIf one player symbolises the quality it is Mohamed Salah. The right-sided attacker gave his latest virtuoso display, scoring the opening goal and setting up Dominik Szoboszlai for the second, the game done and dusted by half-time.\\n\\nSalah has 30 goals and 21 assists from 38 appearances in all competitions this season. Is there any doubt that the club must give Mo his dough to stop him leaving as a free agent?\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Mohamed Salah, from a well-worked corner routine, scores Liverpool’s first goal at Manchester City. Photograph: Dave Thompson/AP\\n\\nThe question for City had concerned whether a champion team had a haymaker left in them at the end of an era. They did not. After the Champions League drubbing at Real Madrid last Wednesday, this was another setback marked by the absence of surprise. “We’re gonna win the league,” the Liverpool fans chanted towards the end, no nerves from them now. Nobody felt ready to disagree.\\n\\nIt was a showpiece where the tactical nuances were pronounced, Pep Guardiola reacting to the absence of Erling Haaland because of knee trouble by giving Phil Foden and Omar Marmoush central attacking roles. Slot did the same with Szoboszlai and Curtis Jones. It was a battle of the false 9s, albeit Marmoush is probably a purer version. It was 4-2-4 against 4-2-4, albeit the systems were not straightforward, partly because Rico Lewis stepped up and inside from right-back for City.\\n\\nThe breakthrough goal was a tactical triumph for Slot. City had started brightly, Jérémy Doku showing his twinkle toes on the left wing, but they were undone by a corner routine that was straight from the Liverpool training ground.\\n\\nAlexis Mac Allister drove it in low for Szoboszlai, who had sprinted towards the near post, and he flicked it back for Salah, who had drifted into space close to the penalty spot. Szoboszlai’s first-time touch was deft; Salah’s first-time finish flew home with the aid of a deflection off Nathan Aké. Liverpool had won the corner after they brought a high press to rob Lewis.\\n\\nSalah was in highlights-reel mood. There was the moment in the first half when he blazed away from Aké and was stopped only by a decent block by Abdukodir Khusanov. There was another one when Salah released the overlapping Trent Alexander‑Arnold with a lovely pass; the City defenders had stood off him, afraid of what he might do.\\n\\nCity tried to work their patterns and Marmoush had the ball in the net on the half-hour from a Foden pass only to be pulled up for offside. It was all too predictable from them and Liverpool were comfortable, Ibrahima Konaté and Virgil van Dijk towers of strength at the back.\\n\\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty Images\\n\\nLiverpool’s second goal was too easy from a City point of view. Szoboszlai looked offside when Alexander-Arnold whipped a high ball up the inside right and so he stopped, briefly, but Salah, who was onside, most assuredly did not. He raced on to the pass and when he squared for Szoboszlai – active in the second phase – the midfielder flashed a low shot past Ederson.\\n\\nThe City fans had wanted to make a couple of points with their pre-match tifos. “City won four in a row,” went the wording on one, even if they know there will be no fifth straight league title this season. “This means four,” read another. They have their history. Liverpool are preoccupied with the here and now.\\n\\nQuick Guide How do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?

He seemed particularly keen to explain what he wanted from Marmoush in terms of pressing. The Liverpool players stuck to the plan. They have so much faith in it.\\n\\nThey got runners in behind City’s high line after the break and only a tight offside decision from the video assistant referee denied Jones a goal for 3-0. The lines came out to show that Szoboszlai had moved too early on to a Ryan Gravenberch pass before teeing up the tap‑in. A little earlier, Khusanov had got back to tackle Luis Díaz, while the Liverpool winger would also work Ederson.\\n\\nFor City, Marmoush drew a fine save out of Alisson but there was not much else. Liverpool might have scored again only for Khusanov to make a big block to thwart Szoboszlai. Who had played the pass? Salah, of course.\"},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-24T00:00:00',\n",
       "   'content': 'Friedrich Merz marked his conservative alliance’s victory in Germany’s election by urging Europe to make itself more independent from the US – a project that will be music to the ears of Emmanuel Macron but may turn on whether Merz can build a Bundestag majority to lift the so-called debt brake that slows increases in defence spending.\\n\\nOne possibility for the CDU/CSU alliance leader, who is on course to become Germany’s next chancellor, is to claim that the country is in an emergency, to try to force the change through the Bundestag before its dissolution.\\n\\nThe remarks by Merz, a lifelong Atlanticist, show how rapidly European leaders are concluding that Donald Trump’s presidency requires the continent to become more responsible for its own security.\\n\\nIt is true that Angela Merkel, a previous CDU chancellor, speculated in 2017 about a growing distance between the US and Europe after a bruising G7 summit during Trump’s first term. But Merz went much further, telling a television audience on Sunday night about his conversations with European leaders to “strengthen Europe as quickly as possible, so that we achieve independence from the US”.\\n\\nHe added: “After Donald Trump’s remarks last week, it is clear that the Americans, at any case the Americans in this administration, do not care much about the fate of Europe.”\\n\\nAs if to ram home the point, he warned on Monday: “This is really five minutes to midnight for Europe.”\\n\\nForeign policy and decisions about defence spending had taken a back seat during the campaign, but Merz struck an urgent tone, saying he was not sure whether the leaders gathering for a Nato summit in June “would still be talking about Nato in its current form or whether we will have to establish an independent European defence capability much more quickly”.\\n\\nNot surprisingly, given Macron’s longstanding views on European strategic autonomy, the French president was quick to talk up the prospect that the Franco-German engine, which had stalled under the cautious chancellorship of Olaf Scholz, might suddenly be capable of repair.\\n\\n“We are experiencing a historic moment. It can lead to an unprecedented Franco-German agreement,” Macron said as he flew to Washington to meet Trump on Monday.\\n\\nMerz and Macron, both natural risk-takers, will want to test where an invigorated partnership could lead.\\n\\nThey will also need to compare notes as to whether the UK, a natural engager with Washington, is starting to conclude its security lies with Europe, and if so, whether some of the Starmer government’s red lines about the single market will have to be removed to kickstart greater European defence cooperation.\\n\\nBefore the election, Merz hinted at his radicalism: “We need to have discussions with both the British and the French – the two European nuclear powers – about whether nuclear sharing, or at least nuclear security from the UK and France, could also apply to us”.\\n\\nHe will also need to make decisions on the supply of Taurus missiles to Ukraine, and on whether joint European defence bonds is an idea worth pursuing. The constraints on EU defence funding will be discussed at a special EU summit on 6 March.\\n\\nIn the short term, it is too much to expect that Germany will offer troops for a proposed European reassurance force in Ukraine. Scholz, now out of the picture, angrily swatted away the idea as premature last week, but Paris and London have been working on joint proposals to deploy troops on the ground, away from the frontline, in the context of a ceasefire.\\n\\nFrance believes Lithuania, Finland and Estonia are likely to join this mission, but efforts are also being made to persuade Sweden and the Netherlands. France and the UK believe this force will require a US “backstop”, particularly in terms of transport, intelligence and air cover. So far, the Trump administration has insisted it will not play the backstop role.\\n\\nOn the domestic front, Merz will have to see whether there is a two-thirds majority in the Bundestag to lift the debt brake, a constitutionally enshrined rule that limits Germany’s structural budget deficit to 0.35% of national output.\\n\\nThe same rule applies to creating a special off-balance-sheet fund such as the €100bn (£83bn) pot announced by Scholz in 2022 to fund an overhaul of the German armed forces.\\n\\nScholz’s SDP would probably vote to end the brake, as would Die Linke, if it were linked to infrastructure instead of defence spending.\\n\\nMerz could argue he does not need to lift the brake since he can create the fiscal space through welfare cuts. Alternative für Deutschland, which came second on Sunday with almost 21% of the vote, is opposed to arming Ukraine or adjusting the brake – one of the issues that led to the premature collapse of the previous coalition.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Anyone with an interest in the history of political vengeance should pay a visit to the rare-book room at the Library of Congress and request the bound volume with the call number DD244.R6. Compiled by Hitler’s chief ideologue, Alfred Rosenberg, Dreissig Novemberköpfe, or Thirty November Heads, is the future chancellor’s political hit list as of 1927: The book profiles government officials, legislators, judges, lawyers, journalists, academics, and one popular satirist targeted by Rosenberg for “poisoning the life essence” of the German people with democratic processes and ideas.\\n\\nThe title is a mendacious nod both to November 1918, the month associated with the founding of the Weimar Republic—“November Republic,” “November Criminals,” “November Traitors”—and to the 1789 French Revolution, when heads rolled from guillotines into the hands of the people.\\n\\nWhile Thirty November Heads is perhaps the most public catalog of Hitler’s political enemies, the more sinister one was the list of communists, social democrats, and people within the Nazis’ own ranks that was being secretly compiled by Hitler’s Sicherheitsdienst, or “SD.” Established in 1931, this “Security Service” was run by Reinhard Heydrich, the ambitious, 20-something assistant to Heinrich Himmler, chief of the Schutzstaffel, or SS. Working out of a spare, upper-floor office in the Nazi Party’s Munich headquarters, Heydrich assiduously collected the names of—and compromising information on—potential Nazi targets on thousands of index cards, a shadow operation within the dark realm of Himmler’s black-uniformed SS protection squads.\\n\\nTimothy W. Ryback: How Hitler dismantled a democracy in 53 days\\n\\nFollowing the Reichstag elections, on March 5, 1933, which came on the heels of Hitler’s appointment as chancellor on January 30, the Nazis seized control of state and local government with a deluge of 200,000 brown-uniformed storm troopers. Local authorities were thrown out of their offices. Swastika banners were hoisted over town halls. Citizens attempting to remove these unauthorized symbols were assailed. Some were sent to concentration camps.\\n\\nIn the southern state of Bavaria, two of Hitler’s closest associates, Adolf Wagner and Hans Frank, were installed as state interior minister and state minister of justice, respectively. Himmler was appointed the new chief of the Bavarian state police, known as the “Green Police” because of the color of their uniforms, while retaining his position as head of the SS. Joseph Hartinger, a Bavarian state prosecutor, immediately recognized the conflict of interest. “Himmler had authority over the SS as well as the state police,” Hartinger observed, “and thus had to be obeyed whenever he gave personal orders relating to police measures in concentration camps.”\\n\\nHimmler suspended Green Police authority over the recently established network of detention facilities, transforming them into black sites in the justice system, a hellish world beyond the reach of accountability or judicial recourse. Himmler also placed his assistant Heydrich in charge of Department IV, the intelligence service of the Bavarian state police. Heydrich now had access to thousands of classified police files, including the reports of police informants who had infiltrated the Nazi Party’s ranks. For people such as Herbert Hunglinger and Sebastian Nefzger, this was a catastrophe.\\n\\nHunglinger was a 53-year-old retired police major who had joined the Nazi Party in 1920, according him the honorific Alter Kämpfer, “Old Warrior,” bestowed on those who had joined the movement in the earliest years, before National Socialism had become politically fashionable. Hunglinger helped establish the Führerschule, a special school for training party leaders, and was said to have possessed the personal trust of the Führer. But recognizing the threat Hitler posed, Hunglinger was all the while feeding intelligence to Bavarian authorities. When his cover was blown, Hunglinger was subjected to brutal interrogation. He confessed his role as a police informant and was dispatched to Dachau, along with five other moles ferreted out by Heydrich via his examination of the Department IV police files.\\n\\nIn Dachau, Hunglinger was placed in Barrack X, a series of single concrete cells, where he was lashed and beaten at regular intervals by SS guards. The pain was such that he begged for a revolver to shoot himself. “We don’t have revolvers,” Hunglinger was told, according to postwar testimony. “Besides, you’re not worth the bullet.” In a “charitable” gesture, he was handed a leather belt and told to hang himself. When guards discovered that Hunglinger was still alive the next day, he was given a particularly severe beating. “That should do it,” an SS guard observed. The next day Hunglinger was found dead, hanged by the neck.\\n\\nSebastian Nefzger, another police informant who had infiltrated the Nazi Party, was found dead in his cell with his wrists slit. An autopsy revealed that the 33-year-old salesman, with a wife and child, had in fact “died from asphyxiation, resulting from strangulation and beating.” The flesh on his back had been flayed to the bone.\\n\\nLoyalty was the sine qua non of service to Hitler and his movement. SS men swore blood allegiance to their Führer: “Treue ist mein Eid,” “Loyalty is my oath.” Treue was reciprocated with Treue, betrayal with unspeakable savagery. The pervasiveness of this blood credo throughout the National Socialist hierarchy, including among Hitler’s closest associates, is evidenced by an inscription in Hitler’s copy of November Heads now held at the Library of Congress. “To Adolf Hitler in loyal subservience!” reads the handwritten dedication.\\n\\nThe author of that dedication was Gregor Strasser, who—in addition to being co-owner of Kampf Verlag, the publishing house that had brought out Thirty November Heads—was in the early 1930s considered equal to Hitler by many in the Nazi Party and superior to him by some. Karl Lüdecke was a Hitler disciple who knew Strasser well. “Within Nazidom, Gregor Strasser was, next to Hitler, the most powerful man and the most effective speaker,” Lüdecke recalled. According to Lüdecke, Strasser was also the most articulate and ardent voice of “the socialist wing” of the Nazi movement, “strong-willed, independent, creative, with a mind of his own—ambitious, but unwilling to sell his soul for the sake of advancement.” Hitler was the fanatical nationalist. Strasser was the committed socialist. Together, the two men lent credence to the National Socialist Party name.\\n\\nRead: What Germany says about far-right politics\\n\\nStrasser possessed a pragmatism that Hitler lacked. “The visionary genius of this man is singular,” Strasser said of Hitler. “But what good is genius that is not anchored in reality, whose brilliant ideas cannot be implemented in the real world.” Implementation became Strasser’s job. The two men had met in the summer of 1921, and across the next decade Strasser assumed growing control over the party’s evolution. It was Strasser who managed the surge in party membership from 27,000 in 1925 to 800,000 by 1931. He quadrupled the number of party chapters, from 71 to more than 270, and, most important, restructured party administration to align with voting precincts, helping drive the Nazis’ stunning electoral successes in the early ’30s. As evidence that he considered himself the chancellor’s peer, Strasser never addressed Hitler as Mein Führer, only Herr Hitler.\\n\\nHitler and Strasser divided Germany into respective political realms. Hitler commanded the south. Strasser, along with his younger brother, Otto, oversaw the north. Hermann Rauschning was a prominent Nazi in the port city of Danzig. “Hitler’s nature was incomprehensible to the North German,” Rauschning observed. North Germans preferred a man like Strasser, who was “practical, clearer headed,” and “quick to act without bombast and bathos, with a sound peasant’s judgment.” When Hitler visited the Ruhr industrial region, he was annoyed by the predominance of Strasser posters.\\n\\nThe left-wing weekly journal Die Weltbühne took the measure of both men: “It doesn’t require much prophetic skill to be of the opinion that in the not-too-distant future Strasser will press his lord and master Hitler into a corner and take the reins of the party.” Within senior party ranks, Strasser was commonly known as “Gregor the Great.”\\n\\nDespite his near-equal position within the party, Strasser placed loyalty to Hitler above all else. Rosenberg recalled that Strasser invariably ended his speeches with the declaration “I fought as a Hitler man, and I will go to my grave as a Hitler man.” But when Hitler clashed with Otto Strasser over the direction of the National Socialist movement, Gregor was forced to choose between Hitler and his brother. One day in the spring of 1928, while Gregor was away, Hitler appeared in the Strasser brothers’ Berlin office and threatened to dispatch 10 storm troopers to pull Otto into line. Otto drew a revolver from his desk. “I have eight shots, Herr Hitler,” he said. “That means eight fewer storm troopers.” Hitler stormed out of the office. But Gregor would side with Hitler over his brother. “Thank God we did not lose Strasser,” Hitler said at the time. “Loyal subservience”—Treue Gefolgschaft—indeed.\\n\\nBut subservience did not mean permanent blindness. In 1932, when the party radicals—Hermann Göring, Joseph Goebbels, Ernst Röhm—pressed Hitler on a “rule or ruin” strategy, Strasser spoke his mind to Hitler, urging accommodation and restraint. When the Nazis took a beating at the polls in the November 6, 1932, Reichstag election, shedding 2 million votes and 40 Reichstag seats, the party was thrown into crisis. “The Führer had misplayed his cards” was the line circulating among senior Nazi Party ranks. The game was up. Karl Lüdecke recalled that Hitler, “with his own chances diving towards zero, was rushing feverishly with his aides from place to place, fighting desperately to fend off a complete Nazi collapse.”\\n\\nStrasser calmly took matters in hand. He told Hitler that the time had come for accommodation. The party should enter into a coalition with Berlin’s ultimate power broker, Kurt von Schleicher, who was a confidant of German President Paul von Hindenburg. Hitler waffled, then dug in. “Strasser argued that Schleicher had to be tolerated,” Goebbels reported to his diary. ”The Führer clashed as fiercely with him as I have ever seen.”\\n\\nHitler was furious when he learned that Strasser had met with Schleicher to explore potential cooperation. He accused Strasser of betrayal. Strasser was reportedly dumbfounded. “Herr Hitler, do you really believe me capable of such a dirty trick?” Strasser asked.\\n\\n“Yes,” Hitler replied.\\n\\nStrasser was “deeply wounded” by Hitler’s accusation. Hans Frank met with Strasser shortly afterward. Frank knew Strasser to be one of the most “confident and pragmatic men” he had ever met. But he found Strasser completely undone, despairing that Hitler was now in the clutches of the party radicals. “Frank, this is horrific,” Strasser said. “Göring is a brutal egotist who could care less about Germany, Goebbels is a club-footed devil, Röhm is a pig. These are the Führer’s guards.” Strasser resigned his party posts, as well as his Reichstag seat, but retained his party membership, ostensibly so as not to damage the already faltering political movement he had helped build.\\n\\nStrasser departed Berlin for a six-week vacation in Italy. Goering and Goebbels, as Lüdecke later recalled, “struck while the iron was hot.” By the end of January 1933, Hitler was chancellor, Göring was a cabinet minister and the chief of police of Prussia, and Goebbels would soon be minister of propaganda. Strasser withdrew from political life, devoting himself to his business interests.\\n\\nTimothy W. Ryback: The oligarchs who came to regret supporting Hitler\\n\\nHitler spoke of bringing Strasser back into the party, but no one took him seriously. Hitler had always seen Strasser as a threat and seemed to be relieved to have him out of the way. Some thought Hitler’s talk of reengaging with Strasser was tactical, to keep Ernst Röhm, who had succeeded Strasser as the second-most-powerful man in the party, off-guard. In the early summer of 1934, when Hitler feared a possible coup by Röhm and his army of storm troopers, Hitler decided to resolve any doubts about who held absolute authority.\\n\\nOn Saturday, June 30, he flew to Munich and dispatched Himmler and SS men on a blood purge of senior storm-trooper ranks—a killing spree code-named Operation Hummingbird. Röhm was taken into custody, handed a pistol, and told to shoot himself. “If I am to be killed,” he said, “let Adolf do it himself.” Röhm was shot dead on the spot. Dozens of senior Röhm associates were summarily executed.\\n\\nThat same day, the SS paid a visit to the Berlin residence of Kurt von Schleicher, who had preceded Hitler as chancellor. When he opened the door, he was asked whether he was von Schleicher. “Yes, I am General von Schleicher,” he said, and was shot dead on the spot. Schleicher’s wife, hearing the gunfire, rushed into the foyer and was gunned down as well. Another former chancellor, Heinrich Brüning, also received a knock on the door of a Berlin address where he was thought to be residing, while, in fact, he had already fled the country.\\n\\nThat same afternoon, Gregor Strasser was having lunch with his family at his home in Berlin. At 1:30 p.m., five Gestapo officers entered the house and informed Strasser that he was suspected of “treasonous activities” and that his office in Munich was to be searched. This must have come as a surprise to Strasser. On February 1 of that year, Strasser had been awarded the Golden Party Pin, one of the Nazi Party’s highest honors, inscribed with Strasser’s founding-membership rank, Number 9. Upon arrival at his office, Strasser was handed over to a waiting SS detachment. There are conflicting accounts of what happened next, but the most credible has him being placed in a cell at the Gestapo headquarters in the Prince Albrecht Palace, where on Reinhard Heydrich’s orders he was shot—in the neck rather than the head, to prolong the agony. He bled to death on the concrete floor over the course of an hour.\\n\\nDuring those same hours, Strasser’s private attorney was shot in his office after refusing to surrender documents “concerning Strasser’s conflict with Hitler,” and Strasser’s former chief of staff was also shot from behind outside his Munich apartment. Strasser’s right-hand man, the Nazi military officer Paul Schulz, was seized and taken for a ride by the Gestapo before being thrown out on the road with the words “Now run, you swine!” Schulz was shot five times and left for dead, but he miraculously survived. (After dragging himself down the road, he was found by a passing car and eventually escaped to Switzerland.) In all, the Night of the Long Knives officially claimed 84 victims, but the actual number was probably much higher.\\n\\nBy June, all but one of Rosenberg’s 30 November heads were either dead, imprisoned, or living in exile. The first November head to go down, before Rosenberg even published his book, was Walther Rathenau, the Weimar-era foreign minister who insisted that Germany respect the “war guilt clause” in the Treaty of Versailles and adhere to the onerous war-reparation payments. In Thirty November Heads, Rosenberg observes that this “racial Jew and liberal esthete” received his just deserts when he was assassinated, in June 1922, by right-wing extremists. Another November head, Matthias Erzberger, who helped negotiate the November 11, 1918, armistice that ended the First World War, was also assassinated by a far-right group before Rosenberg’s book was published. Including Rathenau and Erzberger in the book was Rosenberg’s not-so-subtle way of nodding to the fate that awaited the remaining 28.\\n\\nA few others had by 1934 already died of old age or natural causes. These included Friedrich Ebert, the first president of the Weimar Republic, and Gustav Stresemann, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who, according to Rosenberg, had as “chancellor of capitulation” and “foreign minister of subservience politics” helped subjugate all of Europe to the “reign of Jewish high finance.” Others, like the Social Democratic Party’s leader, Otto Wels, and the popular satirist Kurt Tucholsky (Hitler “has a mustache like Chaplin though hardly as funny”), had fled into exile before dying—Wels to France, where he succumbed to a heart attack, and Tucholsky to Sweden, where he committed suicide. On August 23, 1933, Robert Weismann, “a Jew and a Jurist,” was one of the first 33 Germans to be “denationalized,” their citizenship legally stripped, and deported as an undesirable alien. By 1934, most of the other remaining November heads were in concentration camps.\\n\\nGraeme Wood: Germany’s anti-extremist firewall is collapsing\\n\\nThe lone member of Rosenberg’s list to still be alive and free in Germany as of June 1934 was November head No. 18, Hjalmar Schacht. Schacht was, according to Rosenberg, a central banker who learned the “dark arts” of high finance from Jewish bankers—“Goldschmidts, Mendelssohns, Wassermanns”—and brought ruin to the German economy with inflationary practices while pocketing for himself an annual, inflation-proof salary of “250,000 Goldmarks.” But while Schacht was, according to Rosenberg’s book, a “criminal abuser of the German people” and the “father of the greatest fraud ever perpetrated on the German people,” he would emerge six years later as one of Hitler’s most important facilitators, introducing him to financiers, hosting election fundraisers, and urging President Hindenburg to appoint Hitler chancellor. For these efforts, Hitler rewarded him with a cabinet post and the presidency of the Third Reich’s central bank.\\n\\nYet Schacht soon found himself dismayed by the government in which he was now complicit. “How could you ever take upon yourself the responsibility of determining the fate of human beings without any judicial proceedings?” Schacht asked Hitler after the Night of the Long Knives. “No matter what the circumstances, you should have allowed the trials to take place, even if they had only been summary trials.” Schacht continued to quarrel with Hitler, and in 1938 went so far as to publicly rebuke him for what happened to Jews on Kristallnacht. Eventually, like the other surviving November heads, Schacht would find himself dispatched to a series of concentration camps, ending up at Dachau. Hitler reciprocated Treue with Treue. Until he didn’t.\\n\\nAfter the bloody 1934 purge, Hitler gave a speech justifying his actions. “If anyone reproaches me and asks why I did not resort to the regular courts of justice, then all I can say is this,” he said. “In this hour I was responsible for the fate of the German people, and thereby I became the supreme judge of the German people.” Hitler was as explicit as he was unapologetic. “I gave the order to shoot the ringleaders in this treason,” he said, before going on to dismiss the killing of others, such as Strasser and Schleicher, as collateral damage. “I further gave the order to cauterize down to the raw flesh the ulcers of this poisoning of the wells in our domestic life,” Hitler continued. “Let the nation know that its existence—which depends on its internal order and security—cannot be threatened with impunity by anyone! And let it be known for all time to come that if anyone raises his hand to strike the State, then certain death is his lot.”'},\n",

       "   'content': 'To a degree without precedent, Donald Trump spent much of the 2024 campaign condemning his own country’s military leaders. Indeed, a month before Election Day, the Republican said during an interview, “The military is bad. We have generals that do such a bad job.”\\n\\nIn the same interview, Trump went on to complain that U.S. military leaders “never get fired.”\\n\\nEvidently, he meant it.\\n\\nOn the first day of the president’s second term, for example, he fired Adm. Linda Fagan, the commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, evicting her from her home with three hours of notice. The fact that Fagan was a four-star admiral and the first woman to lead a branch of the military apparently meant very little to the Republican who ousted her.\\n\\nJoint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. CQ Brown Jr. clearly hoped to avoid the same fate. He attended Trump’s inauguration ceremony in the Capitol rotunda as an apparent sign of support, and after the ceremony, the general told reporters that he planned to remain at his post.\\n\\nThe White House had a very different kind of plan in mind. NBC News reported:\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday terminated Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman CQ Brown Jr., the country’s highest-ranking military officer, from his position. ... Brown has held the post since October 2023, after he was nominated by then-President Joe Biden. Brown, a fighter pilot, was the second Black person to serve as Joint Chiefs chairman after Army Gen. Colin Powell held the role from 1989 to 1993.\\n\\nBrown wasn’t alone. As part of a broader purge, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he was also firing Adm. Lisa Franchetti, chief of naval operations, and Gen. James Slife, Air Force vice chief of staff. The top lawyers for the Army, Navy and Air Force were also ousted.\\n\\nIt’s worth emphasizing for context that while Trump and his team appear to revel in chest-thumping bravado, and seem to express indifference to political or public backlashes, the president has repeatedly made some of his most outrageous personnel decisions on Friday nights — a time generally reserved for news that presidents hope Americans won’t notice.\\n\\nIndeed, Trump’s second term has, to date, spanned just five Fridays, and two of them included scandalous firings that drew “Friday Night Massacre” labels.\\n\\nAs for the new chairman of the joint chiefs, the president announced plans to nominate Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan “Razin” Caine to replace Brown, despite the apparent fact that he lacks the requiste qualifications. The New York Times explained:\\n\\nGeneral Caine retired with three stars, as a lieutenant general. By statute, anyone picked to be the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is supposed to have served as a combatant commander, as the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or as the top uniformed officer of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps or Space Force. It was unclear whether General Caine would need a congressional waiver; a congressional aide said the president had some latitude to choose whom he wanted and that exceptions could be made for national security reasons.\\n\\nTo put it mildly, congressional Democrats were not pleased with the developments. House Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Rep. Adam Smith said in a statement, “President Trump’s latest Friday Night massacre has unleashed even more chaos with the firing of Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Charles Q. Brown, Jr. and other top U.S. military leaders via social media, further weakening our national security and national defense and disrespecting those individuals and all who wear the uniform of the United States of America.”\\n\\nThe Washington Democrat added, “C.Q. Brown is a true patriot. He is intelligent, accomplished, and well respected on both sides of the aisle and made history with his decades of exceptional service to our country. That wasn’t good enough for the president, who has chosen — yet again — fealty over proven ability to do the job and loyalty to the Constitution. All of this continues to play into the hands of Vladimir Putin and others working to exploit the weakness Trump continues to broadcast and undermine the military, our government, our national security interests, and democracy worldwide.”\\n\\nIn an op-ed for The Washington Post, Sen. Jack Reed, the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee and a former Army paratrooper, argued, “Donald Trump’s quest for power is endangering our military.”\\n\\nThe Rhode Island Democrat added, “The implications for our national security cannot be overstated. A clear message is being sent to military leaders: Failure to demonstrate personal and political loyalty to Trump could result in retribution, even after decades of honorable service.”\\n\\nThe editorial board of The New York Times made a related case, noting that the president’s approach “destabilizes the very foundation of the institutions that have long safeguarded America’s democracy.”\\n\\nTrump is uprooting the pillars that serve as the foundation of our civic lives. It is difficult to say with confidence when, or if, the United States will again be the United States.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'The sacking of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the chief of naval operations, and the Air Force’s vice chief of staff, as well as the judge advocate generals of the Army, Navy and Air Force on Friday night was completely legal—and appalling.\\n\\nThe consequences of this Friday-night massacre will be long-lasting and damaging. The JAGs embody the deep respect that the United States military has had for the rule of law. Although they merely advise and do not command, their role is a crucial one. The decapitation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Navy, and the firing of the second-most-senior Air Force officer was bad enough.\\n\\nThe replacement of General C. Q. Brown, a highly decorated and cerebral officer, as chairman by a retired lieutenant general was bizarre and unprecedented. By law the role of chair should be filled, unless the president deems an extraordinary exception necessary, by a four star who has led a service or a combatant command. Lieutenant General Dan Caine was relatively junior, and he spent 2009 to 2016 as a reservist. The skills he acquired as a special operator, moreover, are the antithesis of what the most senior military officer in the country needs. The United States armed forces, composed of millions of men and women on active and reserve duty, operates fleets and divisions and air wings. Its leaders need the ability to handle military movements and the political skills to deal with coalition partners in large-scale operations, skills that are acquired on the conventional side of the house, not in shadow warfare.\\n\\nCaine, in other words, is not qualified for the job. If he indeed told President Donald Trump that ISIS could be wiped out in a week or four if only the military were unleashed—as Trump has claimed—he has, moreover, exceptionally poor military judgment. If the Israel Defense Forces, deploying substantial air power and five divisions of mechanized infantry, could not wipe out Hamas in a year-long campaign in the tiny area the group controlled, the United States Air Force could not, and cannot, do the same thing to a wily jihadist military organization spread over several large Middle Eastern countries in less than a month.\\n\\nWhen confronted with civilian superiors behaving outrageously, the response of the American soldier, sailor, air fighter, or Marine is to stiffen, look rigidly ahead, and follow lawful orders. But they reflect. And what they are assuredly thinking today is that the Trump administration is determined to purge the military’s leadership; that it has no respect for the rule of law, including the law of armed conflict; and that it is willing to put them under the command of political generals of doubtful caliber. To say that they will find this demoralizing is an understatement.\\n\\nWorse yet, a minority will applaud this. I have spent my entire career in the company of soldiers, including senior officers, and I have never encountered a group of more honorable men and women. There are, however, in all ranks, as in the rest of humanity, a certain proportion of toadies, opportunists, zealots, and fools. These will now be encouraged to curry favor with political authority, and if there is one thing that the Trump administration has shown itself desirous of, it is brownnosing. That will, in turn, undermine military performance. Promote the bootlickers, sow distrust among the decent ones, and military disaster awaits.\\n\\nThis episode tells us a great deal, none of it too surprising, about the secretary of defense, beginning with the firing itself, conducted on a Friday night and without the courtesy of personal meetings. Pete Hegseth may think of himself as a warrior type, but that was the corporate behavior of a coward. He did not publish his reasons for the firings other than mouthing a platitude or two about the public service of his victims. It was the behavior of a leader who is desperately weak.\\n\\nHe may not yet understand the damage that he has done to himself. It will escape no one’s notice that his two most prominent victims were a Black man and a woman, and that he has raged against women in the military. His unwillingness to explain himself means that the worst construction will be put on his actions. Whereas in a normal administration one should give some benefit of the doubt to leaders making hard calls, he deserves, and will receive, none.\\n\\nThat goes for his tattoos too. On one bicep is Deus Vult, “God wills it,” a motto embraced by some white-nationalist groups (which is why he was removed from duty after January 6). His defense is that it is merely a celebration of the Christian-warrior ethic, a slogan attributed to the Crusaders by contemporary chroniclers.\\n\\nWhen the Crusaders took Jerusalem in 1099, they spent two days killing the Muslim and Jewish inhabitants. Thomas Asbridge writes in his history of the Crusades that the city was “awash with blood and littered with corpses. In the midsummer heat the stench soon became intolerable, and the dead were dragged out beyond the walls, ‘piled up in mounds as big as houses’ and burned.” Six months later, Jerusalem still stank of death.\\n\\nIf celebration of that kind of thing is not what he means, he should make that clear, but of course he will not. A man as petty, thoughtless, and cruel as his boss, he will both feel aggrieved by reactions to his cruelties and ignorant of their likely consequences.\\n\\nThe firings coincided with other assaults both on the American government—the announced firing of more than 50,000 probationary workers in the Pentagon—and on Ukraine, where the United States leaned on Kyiv to withdraw a motion in the UN that would denounce Russia in favor of one, introduced by the United States, that would make no mention of invasion, atrocities, or aggression. In both cases, there was tremendous self-harm, to the civil service on the one hand and to American foreign policy on the other, as Russia gets consequential gifts without paying for them.\\n\\nWhat is to be done? To some extent, the administration is setting up the conditions for its own failures as it causes chaos, alienates constituencies, and cripples essential governmental functions. Some of these actions will be illegal and must be confronted in the courts and beyond; others, like Hegseth’s, will be lawful but still enormously destructive, to which other responses are warranted.\\n\\nAt the very least, the public deserves to know the names of the members of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, whose staffers have cut a swath through governmental departments but hide their identities from view. A sense of accountability in courts of opinion as well as law—and if not now, then in the future, when, inevitably, the wheel turns and they are no longer in positions of power—may help temper some of their worst excesses.\\n\\nUnlike Donald Trump, Elon Musk, or J. D. Vance, I have had children serve in uniform in wartime. The parent of a service member looks with a particularly keen eye at who is in command. C. Q. Brown is the kind of general I would have been proud to have leading them, confident in his professional abilities and his moral compass. To understand the fury that many of us who know him feel at this moment, look at the video of his message following George Floyd’s murder. At a time of racial tension unlike anything since the civil-rights movement, he spoke with dignity, restraint, and the deepest kind of patriotism—the patriotism of a Martin Luther King Jr. or, more to the point, a General Dan “Chappie” James Jr., the first Black four-star general, one of the World War II Tuskegee Airmen.\\n\\nThe worst of the MAGA movement are the neo-Confederates, ignoramuses (to be charitable) about this country’s history—hence their outrage at the renaming of forts called after traitor generals from the Civil War—and in many cases, tapping into deep veins of bigotry. With this move, Pete Hegseth will henceforth labor under the presumption that he is among their number, a man unfit to lead anybody, much less the Department of Defense. Meanwhile, it is a consolation to know that this country produced C. Q. Brown—and that there are many more like him out there.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'What exactly is Donald Trump doing?\\n\\nSince taking office, he has reduced his administration’s effectiveness by appointing to essential agencies people who lack the skills and temperaments to do their jobs. His mass firings have emptied the civil service of many of its most capable employees. He has defied laws that he could just as easily have followed (for instance, refusing to notify Congress 30 days before firing inspectors general). He has disregarded the plain language of statutes, court rulings, and the Constitution, setting up confrontations with the courts that he is likely to lose. Few of his orders have gone through a policy-development process that helps ensure they won’t fail or backfire—thus ensuring that many will.\\n\\nIn foreign affairs, he has antagonized Denmark, Canada, and Panama; renamed the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America”; and unveiled a Gaz-a-Lago plan. For good measure, he named himself chair of the Kennedy Center, as if he didn’t have enough to do.\\n\\nEven those who expected the worst from his reelection (I among them) expected more rationality. Today, it is clear that what has happened since January 20 is not just a change of administration but a change of regime—a change, that is, in our system of government. But a change to what?\\n\\nGraeme Wood: Germany’s anti-extremist firewall is collapsing\\n\\nThere is an answer, and it is not classic authoritarianism—nor is it autocracy, oligarchy, or monarchy. Trump is installing what scholars call patrimonialism. Understanding patrimonialism is essential to defeating it. In particular, it has a fatal weakness that Democrats and Trump’s other opponents should make their primary and relentless line of attack.\\n\\nLast year, two professors published a book that deserves wide attention. In The Assault on the State: How the Global Attack on Modern Government Endangers Our Future, Stephen E. Hanson, a government professor at the College of William & Mary, and Jeffrey S. Kopstein, a political scientist at UC Irvine, resurface a mostly forgotten term whose lineage dates back to Max Weber, the German sociologist best known for his seminal book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.\\n\\nWeber wondered how the leaders of states derive legitimacy, the claim to rule rightfully. He thought it boiled down to two choices. One is rational legal bureaucracy (or “bureaucratic proceduralism”), a system in which legitimacy is bestowed by institutions following certain rules and norms. That is the American system we all took for granted until January 20. Presidents, federal officials, and military inductees swear an oath to the Constitution, not to a person.\\n\\nThe other source of legitimacy is more ancient, more common, and more intuitive—“the default form of rule in the premodern world,” Hanson and Kopstein write. “The state was little more than the extended ‘household’ of the ruler; it did not exist as a separate entity.” Weber called this system “patrimonialism” because rulers claimed to be the symbolic father of the people—the state’s personification and protector. Exactly that idea was implied in Trump’s own chilling declaration: “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.”\\n\\nIn his day, Weber thought that patrimonialism was on its way to history’s scrap heap. Its personalized style of rule was too inexpert and capricious to manage the complex economies and military machines that, after Bismarck, became the hallmarks of modern statehood. Unfortunately, he was wrong.\\n\\nPatrimonialism is less a form of government than a style of governing. It is not defined by institutions or rules; rather, it can infect all forms of government by replacing impersonal, formal lines of authority with personalized, informal ones. Based on individual loyalty and connections, and on rewarding friends and punishing enemies (real or perceived), it can be found not just in states but also among tribes, street gangs, and criminal organizations.\\n\\nIn its governmental guise, patrimonialism is distinguished by running the state as if it were the leader’s personal property or family business. It can be found in many countries, but its main contemporary exponent—at least until January 20, 2025—has been Vladimir Putin. In the first portion of his rule, he ran the Russian state as a personal racket. State bureaucracies and private companies continued to operate, but the real governing principle was Stay on Vladimir Vladimirovich’s good side … or else.\\n\\nSeeking to make the world safe for gangsterism, Putin used propaganda, subversion, and other forms of influence to spread the model abroad. Over time, the patrimonial model gained ground in states as diverse as Hungary, Poland, Turkey, and India. Gradually (as my colleague Anne Applebaum has documented), those states coordinated in something like a syndicate of crime families—“working out problems,” write Hanson and Kopstein in their book, “divvying up the spoils, sometimes quarreling, but helping each other when needed. Putin in this scheme occupied the position of the capo di tutti capi, the boss of bosses.”\\n\\nUntil now. Move over, President Putin.\\n\\nTo understand the source of Trump’s hold on power, and its main weakness, one needs to understand what patrimonialism is not. It is not the same as classic authoritarianism. And it is not necessarily antidemocratic.\\n\\nRead: Trump says the corrupt part out loud\\n\\nPatrimonialism’s antithesis is not democracy; it is bureaucracy, or, more precisely, bureaucratic proceduralism. Classic authoritarianism—the sort of system seen in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union—is often heavily bureaucratized. When authoritarians take power, they consolidate their rule by creating structures such as secret police, propaganda agencies, special military units, and politburos. They legitimate their power with legal codes and constitutions. Orwell understood the bureaucratic aspect of classic authoritarianism; in 1984, Oceania’s ministries of Truth (propaganda), Peace (war), and Love (state security) are the regime’s most characteristic (and terrifying) features.\\n\\nBy contrast, patrimonialism is suspicious of bureaucracies; after all, to exactly whom are they loyal? They might acquire powers of their own, and their rules and processes might prove obstructive. People with expertise, experience, and distinguished résumés are likewise suspect because they bring independent standing and authority. So patrimonialism stocks the government with nonentities and hacks, or, when possible, it bypasses bureaucratic procedures altogether. When security officials at USAID tried to protect classified information from Elon Musk’s uncleared DOGE team, they were simply put on leave. Patrimonial governance’s aversion to formalism makes it capricious and even whimsical—such as when the leader announces, out of nowhere, the renaming of international bodies of water or the U.S. occupation of Gaza.\\n\\nAlso unlike classic authoritarianism, patrimonialism can coexist with democracy, at least for a while. As Hanson and Kopstein write, “A leader may be democratically elected but still seek to legitimate his or her rule patrimonially. Increasingly, elected leaders have sought to demolish bureaucratic administrative states (‘deep states,’ they sometimes call them) built up over decades in favor of rule by family and friends.” India’s Narendra Modi, Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, and Trump himself are examples of elected patrimonial leaders—and ones who have achieved substantial popular support and democratic legitimacy. Once in power, patrimonialists love to clothe themselves in the rhetoric of democracy, like Elon Musk justifying his team’s extralegal actions as making the “unelected fourth unconstitutional branch of government” be “responsive to the people.”\\n\\nNonetheless, as patrimonialism snips the government’s procedural tendons, it weakens and eventually cripples the state. Over time, as it seeks to embed itself, many leaders attempt the transition to full-blown authoritarianism. “Electoral processes and constitutional norms cannot survive long when patrimonial legitimacy begins to dominate the political arena,” write Hanson and Kopstein.\\n\\nEven if authoritarianism is averted, the damage that patrimonialism does to state capacity is severe. Governments’ best people leave or are driven out. Agencies’ missions are distorted and their practices corrupted. Procedures and norms are abandoned and forgotten. Civil servants, contractors, grantees, corporations, and the public are corrupted by the habit of currying favor.\\n\\nTo say, then, that Trump lacks the temperament or attention span to be a dictator offers little comfort. He is patrimonialism’s perfect organism. He recognizes no distinction between what is public and private, legal and illegal, formal and informal, national and personal. “He can’t tell the difference between his own personal interest and the national interest, if he even understands what the national interest is,” John Bolton, who served as national security adviser in Trump’s first term, told The Bulwark. As one prominent Republican politician recently told me, understanding Trump is simple: “If you’re his friend, he’s your friend. If you’re not his friend, he’s not your friend.” This official chose to be Trump’s friend. Otherwise, he said, his job would be nearly impossible for the next four years.\\n\\nPatrimonialism explains what might otherwise be puzzling. Every policy the president cares about is his personal property. Trump dropped the federal prosecution of New York City Mayor Eric Adams because a pliant big-city mayor is a useful thing to have. He broke with 50 years of practice by treating the Justice Department as “his personal law firm.” He treats the enforcement of duly enacted statutes as optional—and, what’s more, claims the authority to indemnify lawbreakers. He halted proceedings against January 6 thugs and rioters because they are on his side. His agencies screen hires for loyalty to him rather than to the Constitution.\\n\\nIn Trump’s world, federal agencies are shut down on his say-so without so much as a nod to Congress. Henchmen with no statutory authority barge into agencies and take them over. A loyalist who had only ever managed two small nonprofits is chosen for the hardest management job in government. Conflicts of interest are tolerated if not outright blessed. Prosecutors and inspectors general are fired for doing their job. Thousands of civil servants are converted to employment at the president’s will. Former officials’ security protection is withdrawn because they are disloyal. The presidency itself is treated as a business opportunity.\\n\\nYet when Max Weber saw patrimonialism as obsolete in the era of the modern state, he was not daydreaming. As Hanson and Kopstein note, “Patrimonial regimes couldn’t compete militarily or economically with states led by expert bureaucracies.” They still can’t. Patrimonialism suffers from two inherent and in many cases fatal shortcomings.\\n\\nThe first is incompetence. “The arbitrary whims of the ruler and his personal coterie continually interfere with the regular functioning of state agencies,” write Hanson and Kopstein. Patrimonial regimes are “simply awful at managing any complex problem of modern governance,” they write. “At best they supply poorly functioning institutions, and at worst they actively prey on the economy.” Already, the administration seems bent on debilitating as much of the government as it can. Some examples of incompetence, such as the reported firing of staffers who safeguard nuclear weapons and prevent bird flu, would be laughable if they were not so alarming.\\n\\nEventually, incompetence makes itself evident to the voting public without needing too much help from the opposition. But helping the public understand patrimonialism’s other, even greater vulnerability—corruption—requires relentless messaging.\\n\\nRead: This is what happens when the DOGE guys take over\\n\\nPatrimonialism is corrupt by definition, because its reason for being is to exploit the state for gain—political, personal, and financial. At every turn, it is at war with the rules and institutions that impede rigging, robbing, and gutting the state. We know what to expect from Trump’s second term. As Larry Diamond of Stanford University’s Hoover Institution said in a recent podcast, “I think we are going to see an absolutely staggering orgy of corruption and crony capitalism in the next four years unlike anything we’ve seen since the late 19th century, the Gilded Age.” (Francis Fukuyama, also of Stanford, replied: “It’s going to be a lot worse than the Gilded Age.”)\\n\\nPaolo Pellegrin / Magnum Photos\\n\\nThey weren’t wrong. “In the first three weeks of his administration,” reported the Associated Press, “President Donald Trump has moved with brazen haste to dismantle the federal government’s public integrity guardrails that he frequently tested during his first term but now seems intent on removing entirely.” The pace was eye-watering. Over the course of just a couple of days in February, for example, the Trump administration:\\n\\ngutted enforcement of statutes against foreign influence, thus, according to the former White House counsel Bob Bauer, reducing “the legal risks faced by companies like the Trump Organization that interact with government officials to advance favorable conditions for business interests shared with foreign governments, and foreign-connected partners and counterparties”;\\n\\nsuspended enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, further reducing, wrote Bauer, “legal risks and issues posed for the Trump Organization’s engagements with government officials both at home and abroad”;\\n\\nfired, without cause, the head of the government’s ethics office, a supposedly independent agency overseeing anti-corruption rules and financial disclosures for the executive branch;\\n\\nfired, also without cause, the inspector general of USAID after the official reported that outlay freezes and staff cuts had left oversight “largely nonoperational.”\\n\\nBy that point, Trump had already eviscerated conflict-of-interest rules, creating, according to Bauer, “ample space for foreign governments, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, to work directly with the Trump Organization or an affiliate within the framework of existing agreements in ways highly beneficial to its business interests.” He had fired inspectors general in 19 agencies, without cause and probably illegally. One could go on—and Trump will.\\n\\nCorruption is patrimonialism’s Achilles’ heel because the public understands it and doesn’t like it. It is not an abstraction like “democracy” or “Constitution” or “rule of law.” It conveys that the government is being run for them, not for you. The most dire threat that Putin faced was Alexei Navalny’s “ceaseless crusade” against corruption, which might have brought down the regime had Putin not arranged for Navalny’s death in prison. In Poland, the liberal opposition booted the patrimonialist Law and Justice Party from power in 2023 with an anti-corruption narrative.\\n\\nIn the United States, anyone seeking evidence of the power of anti-corruption need look no further than Republicans’ attacks against Jim Wright and Hillary Clinton. In Clinton’s case, Republicans and Trump bootstrapped a minor procedural violation (the use of a private server for classified emails) into a world-class scandal. Trump and his allies continually lambasted her as the most corrupt candidate ever. Sheer repetition convinced many voters that where there was smoke, there must be fire.\\n\\nEven more on point is Newt Gingrich’s successful campaign to bring down Democratic House Speaker Jim Wright—a campaign that ended Wright’s career, launched Gingrich’s, and paved the way for the Republicans’ takeover of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1994. In the late 1980s, Wright was a congressional titan and Gingrich an eccentric backbencher, but Gingrich had a plan. “I’ll just keep pounding and pounding on his [Wright’s] ethics,” he said in 1987. “There comes a point where it comes together and the media takes off on it, or it dies.” Gingrich used ethics complaints and relentless public messaging (not necessarily fact-based) to brand Wright and, by implication, the Democrats as corrupt. “In virtually every speech and every interview, he attacked Wright,” John M. Barry wrote in Politico. “He told his audiences to write letters to the editor of their local newspapers, to call in on talk shows, to demand answers from their local members of Congress in public meetings. In his travels, he also sought out local political and investigative reporters or editorial writers, and urged them to look into Wright. And Gingrich routinely repeated, ‘Jim Wright is the most corrupt speaker in the 20th century.’”\\n\\nRead: Why Meta is paying $25 million to settle a Trump lawsuit\\n\\nToday, Gingrich’s campaign offers the Democrats a playbook. If they want to undermine Trump’s support, this model suggests that they should pursue a relentless, strategic, and thematic campaign branding Trump as America’s most corrupt president. Almost every development could provide fodder for such attacks, which would connect corruption not with generalities like the rule of law but with kitchen-table issues. Higher prices? Crony capitalism! Cuts to popular programs? Payoffs for Trump’s fat-cat clients! Tax cuts? A greedy raid on Social Security!\\n\\nThe best objection to this approach (perhaps the only objection, at this point) is that the corruption charge won’t stick against Trump. After all, the public has been hearing about his corruption for years and has priced it in or just doesn’t care. Besides, the public believes that all politicians are corrupt anyway.\\n\\nBut driving a strategic, coordinated message against Trump’s corruption is exactly what the opposition has not done. Instead, it has reacted to whatever is in the day’s news. By responding to daily fire drills and running in circles, it has failed to drive any message at all.\\n\\nAlso, it is not quite true that the public already knows Trump is corrupt and doesn’t care. Rather, because he seems so unfiltered, he benefits from a perception that he is authentic in a way that other politicians are not, and because he infuriates elites, he enjoys a reputation for being on the side of the common person. Breaking those perceptions can determine whether his approval rating is above 50 percent or below 40 percent, and politically speaking, that is all the difference in the world.\\n\\nDo the Democrats need a positive message of their own? Sure, they should do that work. But right now, when they are out of power and Trump is the capo di tutti capi, the history of patrimonial rule suggests that their most effective approach will be hammering home the message that he is corrupt. One thing is certain: He will give them plenty to work with.'},\n",

       "   'title': 'U.N. rejects U.S. resolution that urged end to Ukraine war without mentioning Russian aggression',\n",
       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': 'In a win for Ukraine as it marks three years since Russia\\'s full-scale invasion, the United States on Monday failed to get the U.N. General Assembly to approve its resolution urging an end to the war without mentioning Moscow\\'s aggression. And the assembly approved a dueling European-backed Ukrainian resolution demanding Russia immediately withdraw from Ukraine.\\n\\nIt marks a setback for the Trump administration in the 193-member world body, whose resolutions are not legally binding but are seen as a barometer of world opinion. But it also shows some diminished support for Ukraine, whose resolution passed 93-18, with 65 abstentions. That\\'s lower than previous votes, which saw over 140 nations condemn Russia\\'s aggression.\\n\\nThe United States had tried to pressure the Ukrainians to withdraw their resolution in favor of its proposal, according to a U.S. official and a European diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private. They refused, and then the assembly added language to the U.S. proposal making clear that Russia invaded its smaller neighbor in violation of the U.N. Charter.\\n\\nThe vote on the amended U.S. resolution was 93-8 with 73 abstentions, with Ukraine voting \"yes,\" the U.S. abstaining and Russia voting \"no.\"\\n\\nUkrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Mariana Betsa said her country is exercising its \"inherent right to self-defense\" following Russia\\'s invasion, which violates the U.N. Charter\\'s requirement that countries respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other nations.\\n\\n\"As we mark three years of this devastation — Russia\\'s full invasion against Ukraine — we call on all nations to stand firm and to take … the side of the Charter, the side of humanity and the side of just and lasting peace, peace through strength,\" she said.\\n\\nU.S. deputy ambassador Dorothy Shea, meanwhile, said multiple previous U.N. resolutions condemning Russia and demanding the withdrawal of Russian troops \"have failed to stop the war,\" which \"has now dragged on for far too long and at far too terrible a cost to the people in Ukraine and Russia and beyond.\"\\n\\n\"What we need is a resolution marking the commitment from all U.N. member states to bring a durable end to the war,\" Shea said.\\n\\nThe dueling proposals reflect the tensions that have emerged between the U.S. and Ukraine after President Trump suddenly opened negotiations with Russia in a bid to quickly resolve the conflict. It also underscores the strain in the transatlantic alliance with Europe over the Trump administration\\'s extraordinary turnaround on engagement with Moscow. European leaders were dismayed that they and Ukraine were left out of preliminary talks last week.\\n\\nIn escalating rhetoric, Mr. Trump has called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" falsely accused Kyiv of starting the war and warned that he \"better move fast\" to negotiate an end to the conflict or risk not having a nation to lead. Zelenskyy responded by saying Mr. Trump was living in a Russian-made \"disinformation space.\"\\n\\nSince then, the Trump administration not only declined to endorse Ukraine\\'s U.N. resolution, but at the last minute proposed its own competing resolution and pressed its allies to support that version instead. It comes as Mr. Trump hosted French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday in Washington.\\n\\nThe U.S. also wanted a vote on its proposal in the more powerful U.N. Security Council. China, which holds the council presidency this month, has scheduled it for Monday afternoon.\\n\\nThe General Assembly has become the most important U.N. body on Ukraine because the 15-member Security Council, which is charged with maintaining international peace and security, has been paralyzed by Russia\\'s veto power.\\n\\nThere are no vetoes in the assembly, and the Ukraine resolution, which is co-sponsored by all 27 members of the European Union, is almost certain to be adopted. Its votes are closely watched as a barometer of world opinion, but the resolutions passed there are not legally binding, unlike those adopted by the Security Council.\\n\\nSince Russia forces stormed across the border on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Assembly has approved half a dozen resolutions that have condemned Moscow\\'s invasion and demanded the immediate pullout of Russian troops.\\n\\nThe votes on the rival resolutions — which have sparked intense lobbying and arm-twisting, one European diplomat said — will be closely watched to see if that support has waned and to assess the backing for Mr. Trump\\'s effort to negotiate an end to the fighting.\\n\\nThe very brief U.S. draft resolution acknowledges \"the tragic loss of life throughout the Russia-Ukraine conflict\" and \"implores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.\" It never mentions Moscow\\'s invasion.\\n\\nRussia\\'s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, told reporters last week that the U.S. resolution was \"a good move.\"\\n\\nThe Ukraine\\'s resolution, meanwhile, refers to \"the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation\" and recalls the need to implement all previous assembly resolutions \"adopted in response to the aggression against Ukraine.\"\\n\\nIt singles out the assembly\\'s demand that Russia \"immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.\"\\n\\nIt stresses that any involvement of North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia\\'s forces \"raises serious concerns regarding further escalation of this conflict.\"\\n\\nThe resolution reaffirms the assembly\\'s commitment to Ukraine\\'s sovereignty and also \"that no territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal.\"\\n\\nIt calls for \"a de-escalation, an early cessation of hostilities and a peaceful resolution of the war against Ukraine\" and it reiterates \"the urgent need to end the war this year.\"'},\n",

       "   'content': 'CNN —\\n\\nThe United States joined Russia to vote against a UN General Assembly resolution condemning Russia’s war against Ukraine Monday in a stunning shift from years of US policy.\\n\\nThe vote against the Ukrainian and European-backed resolution saw the US at odds with its longtime European allies and instead aligned with the aggressor in the war on the three-year anniversary of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\\n\\nIt came as the Trump administration has pursued discussions with Moscow about ending the war as the President Donald Trump has ratcheted up his rhetoric towards Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\\n\\nThe resolution was adopted by the General Assembly with 93 votes in favor. It notes “with concern the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation has persisted for three years and continues to have devastating and long-lasting consequences not only for Ukraine, but also for other regions and global stability” and “calls for a de-escalation, an early cessation of hostilities and a peaceful resolution of the war against Ukraine.”\\n\\nThe US had introduced a rival General Assembly resolution, which did not call Russia the aggressor or acknowledge Ukraine’s territorial integrity.\\n\\nIt “implores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.” It mourns “the tragic loss of life throughout the Russia-Ukraine conflict” and reiterates “the principal purpose of the United Nations, as expressed in the United Nations Charter, is to maintain international peace and security and to peacefully settle disputes.”\\n\\nThe US is expected to introduce the same draft resolution at the UN Security Council later on Monday.\\n\\nPrior to the vote in the General Assembly, Ambassador Dorothy Shea, the charge d’affaires at the US Mission to the UN, had urged “all Member States, including Ukraine and Russia” to back the resolution.\\n\\n“A simple, historic statement from the General Assembly that looks forward, not backwards. A resolution focused on one, simple idea: Ending the war. A path to peace is possible,” she said.\\n\\n“Mr. President, that is why the United States opposed putting forward another resolution. And that is why we cannot support Ukraine’s resolution, and we urge its withdrawal in favor of a strong statement committing us to end the war and work towards a lasting peace,” Shea said.\\n\\nThe US ended up abstaining on the vote for its own resolution at the General Assembly after several amendments were passed ahead of the vote to strengthen the language against Russia and reaffirm Ukraine’s territorial integrity.'},\n",

Olga Maltseva/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nThe Trump effect\\n\\nTrump\\'s recent attacks on Zelenskyy appear to have bolstered the latter\\'s political position. Allies and rivals alike rallied around the Ukrainian president\\'s office in the aftermath of Trump\\'s broadsides.\\n\\n\"Only Ukrainians have the right to decide when and under what conditions they should change their government,\" former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko wrote on Facebook. \"None of us will allow such elections before the end of the war. Our enemies and even our allies may not like it, but it is true.\"\\n\\nSerhiy Prytula -- another prominent political figure -- urged compatriots to \"ignore that rhetoric and \\'dictator\\' accusations from Trump.\"\\n\\nThe source close to the Ukrainian government said that certain figures in Trump\\'s orbit want Zelenskyy replaced by a more malleable successor, one less likely to push back on controversial American efforts to force a peace deal.\\n\\n\"According to their logic, the problem here is not Russia or Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, it\\'s the \\'the ongoing war,\\'\" the source said. \"What is the mechanism for changing that, and in their view creating the conditions for someone who would be more compliant in Kyiv? It\\'s elections.\"\\n\\nThe source said Trump\\'s team are wrong to think that Zelenskyy is on unstable political ground. \"They\\'re operating under all of these false assumptions, one of which is that if you hold elections in Ukraine, it will necessarily result in the success of a candidate who is willing to bend to whatever it is that Trump is demanding,\" they said.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think that they have anyone in mind,\" the source added. \"I just think that they\\'re confident in their ability to either create that individual in a way, or to cut some sort of private deal with someone.\"\\n\\nEven if the U.S. and Russia succeeded in unseating Zelenskyy in favor of a more pliant successor, \"if you end up with leadership in Kyiv that is willing to cut some sort of deal that is absolutely unacceptable to a large segment of Ukrainian society, we could see fragmentation, even of the Ukrainian military,\" they said.\\n\\n\"If the Trump administration pushes this government, or any Ukrainian government, too far, I think that this scenario becomes a real one, and this is certainly not in Ukraine\\'s interest or Europe\\'s interest, but I don\\'t see how it\\'s in the interest of the United States either.\"\\n\\nSupporters of Ukraine waves flags and placards as they protest outside the Russian embassy on Feb. 22, 2025 in London, U.K. Leon Neal/Getty Images\\n\\nZekenskyy\\'s challengers\\n\\nFor now, there appears little in the way of a concrete challenge to the incumbent.\\n\\nIn Kyiv, Valerii Zaluzhnyi -- the former Ukrainian commander-in-chief who is now serving as Kyiv\\'s ambassador to the U.K. -- is widely seen as the only real potential challenger to Zelenskyy.\\n\\nZaluzhnyi publicly fell out with the president and his team -- prime among them Andriy Yermak, the head of Zelenskyy\\'s office -- in late 2023 over public comments framing the war as a \"stalemate.\"\\n\\nIt is not clear whether Zaluzhnyi would stand for election. The former commander-in-chief has dodged questions about any future political ambitions.\\n\\nBut a November poll by the Social Monitoring Center organization put the former general at the top of preferred potential presidential candidates backed by 27% of 1,200 respondents. Zelenskyy trailed on 16%, with former President Petro Poroshenko on 7%.\\n\\nUkrainian servicemen operate a Pion self-propelled cannon at a front line position in the Donetsk region, on Feb. 22, 2025. Genya Savilov/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nA February survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) indicated diminished trust in the current president compared to the extraordinary highs of the early months of the war. But it still remains high compared to most democratically-elected leaders. Public trust in Zelenskyy among 1,000 respondents was at 57% in February, compared with 77% in December 2023 and 90% in May 2022, around three months after Russia\\'s invasion. The latest poll showed a 5% bump in trust from December 2024.\\n\\nAnother recent poll by the Identity and Borders in Flux project in partnership with KIIS published on Feb. 19, showed two-thirds of Ukrainians approve of Zelenskyy\\'s actions.\\n\\nThe KIIS poll found that trust in Ukraine\\'s civilian government overall fell to 26% -- a decline from 52% in 2023. In contrast, those surveyed reported overwhelming 96% trust in the Ukrainian military, with 88% saying they trust Zaluzhnyi.\\n\\nThe showdown between Zelenskyy and Zaluzhnyi ended with the former assuming an ambassadorial posting to the U.K., in which the former general has maintained a relatively low media profile and avoided any public revival of tensions with the president.\\n\\nThe same cannot be said for Poroshenko -- another potential electoral rival -- with whom the president is now locked in a very public battle. Earlier this month, Zelenskyy signed a decree sanctioning Poroshenko and several other politically connected wealthy Ukrainians for allegedly undermining national security.\\n\\nPoroshenko dismissed the sanctions as politically motivated and unconstitutional. \"Why are they doing this? Hatred, fear and revenge,\" he said in a statement. \"And because they have elections. Not us. The government.\"\\n\\nThe IBF project poll showed a much lower proportion -- 26-32% -- of Ukrainians would vote for Zelensky in an election. But that still far outpaces Poroshenko, his nearest current rival, and remains far above the 4% figure put forward by Trump.\\n\\nZelenskyy has been unclear on his own political goals. In 2022, the president said he will \"definitely\" remain in his post until Kyiv achieves victory. \"After that, I don\\'t know,\" he added. \"I\\'m not thinking about that now, I\\'m not ready.\"\\n\\nPeace could prove perilous for Zelenskyy if Ukrainian voters do not agree with its terms.\\n\\nOne former official -- who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation -- told ABC News the president \"needs to blame Trump\" if Ukraine is indeed forced into a controversial peace deal.\\n\\n\"He cannot stop this war now and take responsibility, because for him, it will be political suicide,\" they said.'},\n",

(Gavriil Grigorov, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP, File)\\n\\nBANGKOK -- U.S. President Donald Trump’s abrupt reversal of three years of American policy toward Ukraine has raised concerns China might become emboldened to push its territorial claim on Taiwan, though experts say Beijing is most likely in a wait-and-see mode right now to see how the situation in Europe plays out.\\n\\nIn the past two weeks, Trump has falsely claimed Ukraine “should have never started the war,” said Ukraine “may be Russian someday” and questioned the legitimacy of President Volodmyr Zelenskyy\\'s government, while upending the longstanding American position of isolating Russia over its aggression by beginning direct talks with Moscow and voicing positions sounding remarkably like the Kremlin\\'s own.\\n\\nBefore heading to Washington for talks with Trump on Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron said he would emphasize “you can\\'t be weak in the face of President Putin.”\\n\\n“It\\'s not you, it\\'s not your trademark, it\\'s not in your interest,” Macron said he would tell Trump. “How can you, then, be credible in the face of China if you\\'re weak in the face of Putin?”\\n\\nLike Moscow\\'s claim Ukraine is rightfully Russian territory, China claims the self-governing island of Taiwan as its own. Chinese President Xi Jinping has not ruled out taking it by force.\\n\\nTrump on Friday appeared to walk back his earlier comments inaccurately blaming Ukraine for starting the war, but his administration\\'s overall abrupt shift in policy on the conflict could cause some in Taiwan to question “whether the United States could pull the rug out from underneath them as well,” said Russell Hsiao, executive director of the Global Taiwan Institute in Washington.\\n\\nStill, while Beijing is certainly paying close attention to Trump\\'s comments, it is unlikely to act in haste, he said.\\n\\n“I don’t think Xi Jinping will be so brash as to roll the iron die on the conclusion that just because Trump acted in a certain way concerning Ukraine he would do the same over Taiwan,” Hsiao said. “Trump is too unpredictable.”\\n\\nTrump was quite popular in Taiwan when he left office in 2021 and was widely credited with bringing the U.S. and the democratically governed island closer together.\\n\\nBy American law, the U.S. is obligated to supply Taiwan with sufficient hardware and technology to fend off invasion from the mainland, but maintains a policy of “strategic ambiguity” on whether it would come to Taiwan\\'s defense.\\n\\nRecently, Trump has been more critical of Taiwan, saying it should pay the U.S. for its military defense. On several occasions, he also has accused Taiwan of taking computer chip manufacturing business away from the U.S. and suggested earlier this month he might impose tariffs on semiconductors.\\n\\nAt the same time, Trump has appointed many China hawks in his administration, including in top-level positions such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\\n\\nAfter meeting NATO allies in Brussels earlier this month, Hegseth stressed that if the U.S. were to pull back support from Ukraine, it would be to concentrate on the Asia-Pacific region and leave European defense primarily to Europeans.\\n\\n“The deterrent effect in the Pacific is one that really can only be led by the United States,” Hegseth said.\\n\\nA few days later, Rubio issued a joint statement with his counterparts from Japan and South Korea after they met on the sidelines of a security conference in Munich, stressing the “importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of security and prosperity for the international community.”\\n\\nIn a move that irked Beijing, the State Department also removed a line on American opposition to independence for Taiwan in a revised U.S. government fact sheet on the island.\\n\\n“If I were Beijing, I would be paying the most attention to what Hegseth said about why the U.S. is changing its support to Ukraine,” said Meia Nouwens, senior fellow for Chinese security and defense policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.\\n\\n“Hegseth said this is about the Indo-Pacific, that the U.S. has priorities elsewhere, and I don\\'t think, from Beijing\\'s perspective, that would have been comforting,\" Nouwens said.\\n\\nThe shift on Ukraine will give China the opportunity to push a message that the U.S. is an unreliable partner, she said, but it was unlikely Beijing would read Washington\\'s seeming willingness to concede Ukrainian territory as it being somehow open to Taiwan falling into Chinese hands.\\n\\n“The broader trend lines of each country, of the U.S. and China, looking forward aren\\'t necessarily changing,” Nouwens said. “Neither wants to give up any space, both want to continue on a trajectory that increases their national strength.”\\n\\nIt is worth noting that in the early months of Trump\\'s first term, there were concerns his administration might be moving too close to China, but he actually took a much tougher approach than some before him, said Euan Graham, a senior defense analyst with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\\n\\nGraham said that while all American allies “should be concerned by the Trump administration’s abandonment of Ukraine and willingness to deal with Putin,\" it would be ”simplistic\" to assume a similar arrangement would apply to the China-Taiwan situation.\\n\\n“It’s more likely that the U.S. administration is attempting, misguidedly, to get Ukraine out of the way by making it a European problem, in order to face China from a relatively stronger position,” Graham said. “I think it’s a dangerous approach, because of the appalling precedent it sets. But it’s unlikely to be repeated with China.\"\\n\\n___\\n\\nDidi Tang in Washington, D.C., and Sylvie Corbet and John Leicester in Paris contributed to this story.'},\n",

The agency, citing the Ukrainian Ministry of Health, said that by mid-2024, 100,000 amputations had been performed due to the war. Meanwhile, there is a severe shortage of trauma specialists, prosthetics and rehabilitation services, the WHO said.\\n\\nThe WHO also warned about attacks on the health care system and workers. Since the start of the war, the agency said it has documented at least 2,254 attacks, with 42 attacks so far in 2025 alone, which resulted in 12 injuries and three deaths.\\n\\nAmid the attacks was damage to the Okhmatdyt Children\\'s Hospital in Kyiv -- one of the most well-respected children\\'s hospitals in the country -- when five Ukrainian cities fell under attack in July 2024, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at the time.

       "   'title': 'Denmark’s PM Opens Up About Fiery Trump Call Over Greenland',\n",
       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': 'Among Donald Trump’s more alarming pronouncements on the international stage have related to the vast island of Greenland, a frigid and sparsely populated territory in the Arctic. During his first term as President, Trump expressed a desire to buy the island from Denmark, and he lashed out at Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in 2019, after she called the discussion “absurd” and told him that Greenland was not for sale.\\n\\nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump has ramped up his demands for control of the island, even suggesting that it may need to be taken by force. These statements have shaken the U.S. relationship with Denmark, a member of the NATO alliance and the European Union. During a fiery phone call with Frederiksen last month, Trump reportedly made his most aggressive push yet to pry the semi-autonomous territory away from Denmark. Frederiksen has insisted that it is up to Greenland, which gained home rule in 1979 and further powers in 2009, to decide its future.\\n\\nSpeaking anonymously since then to the media, European diplomats called the tone of the phone call “horrendous” and said the Danes are “freaked out” about the pressure Trump could bring to bear against them. In an exclusive interview with TIME on Feb. 16, Frederiksen spoke out in detail for the first time about her call with Trump, what it means for his relationship with Europe, and how she’s navigating new transatlantic tensions on Ukraine and NATO.\\n\\nWhat follows is a transcript of the conversation, which took place on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. It has been condensed and edited for clarity by TIME.\\n\\nTIME: Please tell me about your phone call with President Trump on Jan. 20. What was the conversation about? What impression did it leave you with?\\n\\nI enjoyed our conversation. Your president is very direct, and I can be the same. It was a conversation where we didn’t dance around the hot topics, but went directly into them.\\n\\nWe don’t look at the world with exactly the same eyes. But the president is interested in trying to understand what the European perspective is on things, and I think as a European leader it is extremely important to be curious about what the American perspective is.\\n\\nFor example, on the Indo-Pacific, that region is quite far away from Europe. But we need to be able to see why there is a change in the U.S. security thinking there, because of China. So what I’m trying to say in Europe is: Hey, if we want the U.S. to help us with Ukraine and Russia, then we have to be willing to do the same the other way around.\\n\\nWas all of this part of your conversation with Trump?\\n\\nYes, we talked about the Middle East. We talked about the Arctic region, including Greenland. We also talked about what I think is one of the most defining changes in the security landscape: the closer cooperation between Russia, Iran, and North Korea.\\n\\nThis triangle is extremely dangerous. These three countries are so different from each other. Their history, their way of thinking, even their national interests. But there is one thing that they really share: They hate us, and they are willing to destroy us.\\n\\nI think in part of Europe, and part of the U.S., there is still this attitude about the end of the Cold War, the end of History, that war is over, and the rest of the world will become democratic and will start to think like we do. It didn’t happen, and it will not happen.\\n\\nMy key message to the U.S. is: Stick together with Europe, because even though you can be frustrated with Europe, and we can have disagreements, it’s nothing compared to those with Iran, North Korea, Russia, and China.\\n\\nRussia would not be able to wage war in Ukraine without help from China. And I keep trying to tell all my European colleagues: These challenges will not disappear. So we are in a hurry now! We really have to ramp up production and spend much more on defense and security.\\n\\nBased on Trump’s statements not only about Greenland, but also the Panama Canal and Canada, what kind of vision does he have for the world?\\n\\nI think that, when President Trump and others are saying America First, it’s not just words. It is a belief. It’s not a new way of thinking. We have seen it through U.S. history. I am, as you know, a transatlanticist at heart. I will fight for our alliance, and I will try to convince everybody to stick together. But I think there are quite a lot of Americans who really believe in the idea of America First. I don’t believe in a strategy of Denmark First, or Europe First. I believe in a shared commitment to democracy and cooperation first.\\n\\nWhen you spoke about Greenland with President Trump, what was your position? You said Greenland is not for sale? What else?\\n\\nFor me, it’s very natural that allies have an interest in what’s going on in the Arctic. To be very frank, I think all of us, including the frontline states in the Arctic region—like Denmark, but also Norway, Finland, Sweden, Canada, and the U.S.—should convince the rest of NATO to put the Arctic high on the agenda. If we look at Russia today, they are not only being aggressive in Ukraine. Look at what they are doing in Georgia and Moldova. Look at what they did in Romania with the elections. They did not only interfere. They “won” the election in a European country.\\n\\nAs I’ve said many times before, the war in Ukraine has never been about Ukraine. It has been about Russia and its imperial dreams. And it goes for the Arctic region as well.\\n\\nBut Trump was not talking only about U.S. security interests in Greenland. He was talking about natural resources, was he not?\\n\\nWhen it comes to security and defense, that’s an issue for me, because the Faroe Islands and Greenland are part of the Kingdom of Denmark. They are part of NATO. When it comes to natural resources, what I hear from the Greenlandic government is that they are open for more business, more investments, and they are looking in the direction of the U.S. and other reliable partners, not China. Not China.\\n\\nSo I think there is room for maneuver. My suggestion is that we sit around the table and open that discussion. When it comes to sovereignty, it is very clear that Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark. And we are of course a sovereign state. So I hope and expect that everybody respects our territorial integrity like anywhere else in the world.\\n\\nLet me ask about another Trump phone call. The one he had with Vladimir Putin on Feb. 12. What went through your mind when you saw that?\\n\\nAs Volodymyr Zelensky has said, Ukraine is ready to enter negotiations and talk about peace. My question is: Are we sure we can rely on the Russians? Are we sure we can trust them? Are we sure they want peace? Everything that I see when I’m looking at Russia, I see the opposite. I see a country that does not want peace.\\n\\nThat’s one thing that I think everybody should be concerned about, including the U.S. For me, just as important is the question: What will Russia do after a peace agreement, after a ceasefire? Not only in Ukraine but the rest of Europe. I think there is a big risk that Russia will use this opportunity to mobilize, to rebuild, and then they will continue. Maybe in Ukraine. Maybe Georgia, Maybe Armenia. Maybe Moldova. Maybe Central Asia. We have to be able to imagine that they will also proceed in NATO countries. My conclusion is we have to stop Russia.\\n\\nSome European leaders have said that, if the U.S. backs away from Ukraine and tries to negotiate some deal with Russia, then the Europeans will stick with Ukraine and help Ukraine continue to resist. Is that your position?\\n\\nI don’t believe in changing your strategy. I believe in following your strategy and sticking to it. Of course, I hope to have a good relationship with the U.S. I will seek to ensure that. But U.S. decisions are U.S. decisions, and European decisions are European decisions.\\n\\nI don’t know what position the U.S. will take in the future. But I know that, no matter what, Europe has to be able to do what is necessary for Europe. I will always be supportive of alliances, but it takes two to tango.\\n\\nFor me, the most important thing now is to build Europe to be as strong as possible. I’m a strong believer in Europe. If you combine all our countries and all our economies, we are a strong player. Everybody knows that. I think Europe, if we are willing, we can do almost whatever we want. For me, it’s about willingness above anything else.\\n\\nTherefore, my main message in these weeks and months is that we need to be in a hurry. We have to scale up on defense and security. It’s the only way forward.\\n\\nSo even if the U.S. changes its strategy on Ukraine, Europe should not change its strategy?\\n\\nExactly. That shouldn’t change our strategy. I don’t think Europe should ever make any division with the U.S.\\n\\nBut if the U.S. under Trump moves in a different direction, don’t you have to adjust?\\n\\nOf course you have to adjust, but then it would be a decision made in the U.S. I don’t think we should make a European decision of splitting up. Our own strategy cannot be formed by what is happening somewhere else in the world. We need to have a European strategy on our own.\\n\\nWhat do you think of the idea of European soldiers going to Ukraine to secure a possible ceasefire? What prompted you and other European leaders to begin considering this last year?\\n\\nThis discussion has been on-and-off-the-table for a long time. I remember Emmanuel Macron invited us to a meeting in Paris to discuss this one year ago. But for me, the easiest and cheapest way to achieve a just, reliable peace in Europe and Ukraine is NATO membership for Ukraine. And I have been in favor of NATO membership since the war began. If they were a member of NATO, the war would never have started.\\n\\nThe other options are more dangerous. Article 5 of NATO is so simple. That’s why I am still one of the European leaders who fights for Ukraine’s NATO membership. That’s my number one priority.\\n\\nAnd what about the option of European troops in Ukraine to secure the peace?\\n\\nThere are many steps before having boots on the ground in Ukraine. Before even entering a concrete discussion about this. Putting your young men and women into a war without full, 100% agreement on the back-up and their safety—that’s a no-go.\\n\\nDoes that back-up need to be American?\\n\\nIn my view, yes. I think it should be America, and it should be Article 5, directly or indirectly.\\n\\nWhat do you mean by ‘indirectly’? Article 5 of the NATO treaty means mutual defense: If one country is attacked, then all must respond. How do you get that for Ukraine indirectly?\\n\\nOne idea that has been on the table is maybe not NATO membership, but a ceasefire or peace agreement with some kind of troops on the ground. And if Russia does a single move that goes against what we have agreed on, then Article 5 comes into effect.\\n\\nSo give Russia one chance, and then NATO mutual defense kicks in?\\n\\nYes. You know, I’m a hardliner on security. But safety for my soldiers who would be a part of this, that’s my top priority, and that goes for everybody who would be a part of this. So there are many questions to be addressed first.\\n\\nI understand that some NATO leaders, but not all, gathered in December to discuss this issue at the home of Mark Rutte, the NATO secretary general. You were there. Could you tell me about this kind of informal meeting and why it was necessary?\\n\\nIt’s only natural. One of the things I have really enjoyed in recent years is this horseshoe that has formed in Europe with The Netherlands, the U.K., the Nordic countries, the Baltic States, and Poland. We are more and more aligned in our way of thinking. We are also some of the hardliners in security, in helping Ukraine, in the willingness to step up on defense. There has been this cooperation before, but it was softer.\\n\\nNow we are getting more and more structured. The world is on speed right now. Everything is changing. It’s only natural that some countries will work more closely together now to form some ideas. Of course, they have to be decided collectively afterwards.\\n\\nUkraine’s president, despite all the pressure he is now facing from the U.S., seems to have found the confidence to push back against some of Donald Trump’s positions on Ukraine. Does the backing of Europe give him that confidence?\\n\\nWe have his back. I’ve said it to him from the beginning: We are with you until the end. We’re not going to leave you. I think we have fulfilled that promise for three years, and we will continue to do so.'},\n",

       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': 'On Jan. 2, 1988, U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney signed a revolutionary free trade deal that removed tariffs on goods and services across the world’s longest border.\\n\\nThe treaty was not controversial in the U.S., but many Canadians feared it would eventually lead to a loss of political independence. During the election later that year, Mulroney had to fend off accusations that he sold Canada out.\\n\\n“We built a country east and west and north,” said Liberal leader John Turner during the key TV debate. “We built it on an infrastructure that deliberately resisted the continental pressure of the United States. For 120 years we’ve done it. With one signature of a pen, you’ve reversed that, thrown us into the north-south influence of the United States and will reduce us ... to a colony of the United States, because when the economic levers go, political independence is sure to follow.”\\n\\nMulroney handily won the election, and the free trade deal survived. But 36 years later, as President Donald Trump repeatedly threatens to make Canada the 51st state, it is starting to look like Turner had a point.\\n\\nTrump’s threats have galvanized Canadians. Polls show they are overwhelmingly opposed to joining the U.S., and they are suddenly open to taking previously unpopular steps to strengthen their country’s independence. Yet Canada is in an incredibly difficult negotiating position because of just how reliant it has become on American markets.\\n\\nWhen Mulroney and Reagan signed the deal, 75% of Canadian exports went south of the border. It is now 80%. That is not a huge increase, but trade has surged from around one-third of Canada’s economy in its first 100 years to two-thirds today. If Trump follows through on his threatened 25% tariffs, Canada would be plunged into recession.\\n\\nAnd Trump can make those threats because Canada depends on trade far more. Even for Michigan, where auto parts go back and forth across the border to Ontario up to eight times during the manufacturing process, trade with Canada makes up only 11% of its economy. Overall, Canada-U.S. trade is about 3% of the U.S. economy to a third of Canada’s.\\n\\nCanada has always grappled with the gravitational pull of the U.S. The first Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, built a rail line from the Atlantic to the Pacific to settle the plains and ward off the Americans. The country began to stop resisting the pull of gravity after the Second World War, negotiating the landmark Auto Pact trade deal in 1965. But President Richard Nixon’s 10% tariffs on all imports in 1972 pushed Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau—Justin’s father—to try once again to reduce Canada’s economic dependence on America. His government brought in a foreign investment review process and, eventually, the National Energy Program. But the move infuriated oil-rich Western Canada and regional opposition killed Trudeau’s program, removing a crucial lever that Ottawa could have used in today’s crisis.\\n\\nRead More: How Canada Fell Out of Love With Trudeau\\n\\nEvery government since Trudeau Père has tried to diversify trade, with limited success. The gravitational pull of America is impossible to resist—or ignore.\\n\\nIn 1969, Pierre Trudeau famously told the Washington Press Club that Canada is like a mouse sharing a bed with an elephant: “No matter how friendly and even-tempered is the beast, if I can call it that, one is affected by every twitch and grunt.”\\n\\nThe elephant is now decidedly less friendly, and is doing far more than twitching and grunting. Trump has agreed to pause the 25% tariffs for 30 days, but that is not enough time to allow Ottawa to reorient trade relationships that have been built for decades around assumptions that are now collapsing.\\n\\nThe problem for Canada is that it can’t quickly shift its exports to new markets. If the U.S. no longer wants Canadian aluminum or potash, there isn’t the rail and port capacity to send it elsewhere. It’s a similar case for the 4 million barrels of cut-rate crude that goes to the U.S. every day—entirely the source of the U.S. trade deficit with Canada—given the lack of east-west pipelines and other infrastructure.\\n\\nTrump’s threats have sent an icy jolt of fear through the land, and Canadian opinions have suddenly shifted on pipelines and other questions. Premiers are swearing they are ready to dismantle internal trade barriers. Even former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper—one of the most pro-American leaders in Canadian history—said Tuesday that Canadians must “accept any level of damage to preserve the independence of the country.”\\n\\nThe federal government has vowed retaliatory tariffs and provinces have ordered U.S. booze removed from liquor store shelves, meaning millions of Canadians would have to drown their sorrows with rye instead of bourbon. That is a powerful gesture, but last year Canadian tipplers spent $1.5 billion Canadian on American spirits—a mere 0.5% of U.S. liquor production.\\n\\nSome hoped that the negotiations around the USMCA in 2019 would offer clues to a better approach. Canadian tariffs targeted industries who would have the ear of U.S. decision makers—betting that Kentucky distillers would find a way to get in touch with then-Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, for instance. That was coupled with friendly chats with business partners and politicians in border states who know the value of the northward exports, which seemed to eventually help convince Trump to sign a deal that looked not too dissimilar to NAFTA, calling it the “best agreement we’ve ever made.” But on Wednesday, after Canadian premiers went to the White House to plead their case, a deputy chief of staff reiterated that annexation is the goal.\\n\\nResistance to Trump’s tariffs on Canada is likely to emerge south of the border, from laid off autoworkers and consumers paying more for gas, cars, and appliances—a political struggle in which Canadians will be onlookers. But Republican lawmakers are lining up behind Trump and he’s said any higher prices would be “worth it.”\\n\\nWhere does this leave Canada? The unpopular Trudeau is finally on his way to the exit. The once inevitable ascension of Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is now in doubt, since former central banker Mark Carney—a Liberal—looks like he might be better suited to managing Trump.\\n\\nVoters are on track to decide between the two men in an election expected this spring. Both are now promising to stand up to Trump and make tough decisions to make Canada more resilient. Ironically, Trump may have done Canadians a favor by pushing them to do things they ought to have done long ago.\\n\\nThe mouse has had a nasty fright and is doing what it can to protect itself.'},\n",

       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': 'Why is Ukraine negotiating a minerals deal with the US?\\n\\n3 hours ago Abdujalil Abdurasulov BBC News Reporting from Kyiv\\n\\nGetty Images The Ukraine has substantial supplies of key minerals, but some are now in Russian-occupied territory\\n\\nKyiv and Washington are close to signing a deal over US access to Ukraine\\'s mineral deposits, a Ukrainian minister says. Olga Stefanishyna, deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, said on X that \"negotiations have been very constructive, with nearly all key details finalised\". She added that \"we are committed to completing this swiftly to proceed with its signature\". Zelensky first included the offer of an agreement on minerals in the so-called \"victory plan\" that he presented to Trump last September. The idea was to offer the then presidential candidate a tangible reason for the US to continue supporting Ukraine. On Monday former UK prime minister Boris Johnson told the BBC in Kyiv that such a deal was \"the great prize\" because it would secure \"a United States commitment under Donald Trump to a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine\".\\n\\nWhat minerals does Ukraine have?\\n\\nKyiv estimates that about 5% of the world\\'s \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine. This includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles. Ukraine also has a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries. And prior to the Russian invasion, Ukraine\\'s global share of titanium production, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations, was 7%. Further, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.\\n\\nRos Atkins on... the fight for Ukraine\\'s critical minerals\\n\\nSome of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine\\'s economy minister, resources worth $350bn (£277bn) remain in occupied territories today. In 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, and half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits. Dr Robert Muggah, principal of SecDev, says that such minerals add a \"strategic and economic dimension\" in Russia\\'s continued aggression. By seizing them, he says, Moscow denies access revenue for Ukraine, expands its own resource base and influences global supply chains.\\n\\nWhy does the US want them?\\n\\nCritical minerals \"are the foundation of the 21st Century economy\", Dr Muggah explained. They are key to renewable energy, military applications and industrial infrastructure and play \"a growing strategic role in geopolitics and geoeconomics\", he said. Additionally, the US is keen on a deal for Ukraine\\'s mineral resources because it wants to reduce dependency on China, which controls 75% of rare earth deposits in the world, according to the Geological Investment Group. In December China banned the export of some rare earth minerals to the US, having previously limited mineral exports to the US the previous year. On Monday, ahead of a visit with French President Emmanuel Macron, White House National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told US news outlet NewsNation that the deal was \"about growing the pie economically and binding the US and Ukraine together for the future\".\\n\\nGetty Images Minerals such as lithium and graphite are vital for electric car production\\n\\nWhat do we know about the negotiations so far?'},\n",

Three years of gratitude. Three years of absolute heroism of Ukrainians,” Zelensky said on X, while expressing his “eternal gratitude to the fallen heroes.”\\n\\nZelensky also shared a somber video of top European leaders placing lanterns at a Kyiv memorial, decked out with dozens of flags of Ukraine and its allies.\\n\\nWhile European leaders tried to convey unity – announcing a new support package for Ukraine, with the United Kingdom also unveiling new sanctions against Moscow – the continent is now facing the prospect of resisting Russia alone, following the extraordinary blows dealt by the Trump administration to the transatlantic alliance.\\n\\nOn Monday, the United States abstained from voting for its own resolution at the United Nations General Assembly after several amendments were added to strengthen the language against Russia and reaffirm Ukraine’s territorial integrity.\\n\\nThe amended resolution, which included new language blaming Russia for the invasion, was then adopted by the UN General Assembly.\\n\\nThe original draft resolution did not call Russia the aggressor in the war or acknowledge Ukraine’s territorial integrity.\\n\\nLast week, after Ukraine was not invited to US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia, President Donald Trump echoed Kremlin disinformation about how the war in Ukraine began and later called Zelensky a dictator.

Asked to reflect on the war’s third anniversary, Taras Berezovets, a major in Ukraine’s army, told CNN it would be better to ask Russian President Vladimir Putin “about his feelings, because he was planning to occupy Kyiv in three days… But instead of this, he’s now in the fourth year of this war.

       "   'content': 'CNN —\\n\\nUS President Donald Trump is pushing for a quick end to the war in Ukraine, and earlier this week, top US and Russian officials met for peace talks in Saudi Arabia — without any representatives from Kyiv present.\\n\\nUkraine and its European allies are stunned and scrambling to adapt to the new approach from the United States.\\n\\nIn the three years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion, Ukraine has lost swaths of land, managing to regain some thanks to military aid from its Western allies. Millions of Ukrainians have been uprooted with thousands killed or injured.\\n\\nHere’s where things stand in Ukraine, in four graphics:\\n\\nUkraine has lost 11% of its land since 2022\\n\\nAt the start of the war, Ukraine held back troops from its capital, Kyiv, and later secured victories in parts of the northeast Kharkiv and southern Kherson regions. But it also sustained major losses in eastern areas around Donetsk and Bakhmut.\\n\\nSince the 2022 invasion, Ukraine has lost control of about 11% of its land, according to CNN analysis of data from the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor. When factoring in land already lost to Russia and Russian-backed separatists since the conflict began in 2014, the total land Ukraine has lost to Russia since 2014 is about 18%, per CNN calculations.\\n\\nIn 2014, Russian forces illegally annexed Crimea from Ukraine, shortly after the events of the Maidan Revolution sparked political turmoil in Kyiv. Later that year, Russian-sponsored separatists took control of parts of the Donbas region, gains that have remained in Russian hands to the present day.\\n\\nWhen Russia launched its full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin expected to seize all of Ukraine in a matter of days, according to the Institute for the Study of War. What happened instead was three years of intense fighting, thanks to Ukraine counteroffensives armed by tranches of aid coming from its Western allies.\\n\\nThe threat to Ukraine’s biggest source of aid\\n\\nThe United States has been the biggest single contributor of funding for Ukraine since the war began in 2022, giving about $95 billion in military, humanitarian and financial help — aid that may be in peril under the Trump administration.\\n\\nHere’s an overview of where the money for Ukraine’s war efforts has come from:\\n\\nTrump, who promised to end the war in Ukraine swiftly, was critical about US funds being sent to Ukraine throughout his 2024 campaign. Recently, he’s suggested taking a transactional approach to aid, saying the US should receive access to rare earth minerals in return, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected.\\n\\n“I told them that I want the equivalent, like $500 billion of rare earth, and they’ve essentially agreed to do that, so at least we don’t feel stupid. Otherwise we’re stupid. I said to them, we have to get something. We can’t continue to pay this money,” Trump told Fox News earlier this month.\\n\\nUkraine has already been affected by the recent suspension of USAID activity. The funding freeze has led Ukrainian NGOs and charities to make cuts including laying off staff and temporarily shutting down suicide helplines and HIV detection projects. In the last three years, Ukraine has been the biggest recipient of USAID funds.\\n\\nMillions of Ukrainians have been displaced\\n\\nMillions of Ukrainians have fled their homes, either to other parts of Ukraine or other countries, in the years since Russia began seizing land and following the invasion.\\n\\nJust over 6.3 million Ukrainian refugees are living in Europe, including about 1.2 million in Germany, nearly 1 million in Poland and 390,000 in the Czech Republic, according to data through the end of 2024 from the UN’s refugee agency.\\n\\nThere were 1.2 million Ukrainian refugees living in the Russian Federation, per the UN’s latest estimate as of June 2024.\\n\\nThousands of civilians have died\\n\\nMore than 40,000 civilians have been killed or injured in Ukraine during the conflict, with many of the deaths caused by explosive weapons, according to the UN Human Rights Office.\\n\\nAt least half of those killed (6,203) were adult men and 669 were children.\\n\\nCNN’s Stephen Collinson, Christian Edwards, Anna Chernova, Edward Szekeres, Ivana Kottasová and Maria Kostenko contributed to this report.'},\n",

On Saturday, Trump repeatedly lied about the war to right-wing attendees at the Conservative Political Action Conference, falsely claiming that the U.S. has provided more military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine than Western Europe, and painting Kyiv as the reason the war has not yet ended.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nNow, GOP officials who have spoken out against Russia and supported the U.S. backing of Ukraine are trying to balance those existing positions while remaining loyal to Trump, who has a history of trying to gain favor with Putin.\\n\\nJust last week, Sen. Roger Wicker (Miss.) called Putin a “war criminal” who should “be in jail for the rest of his life,” Sen. John Kennedy (La.) said he “makes Jeffrey Dahmer look like Mother Theresa,” and Sen. Thom Tillis (N.C.) called him “a cancer and the greatest threat to democracy.” All three senators did not mention Trump by name.\\n\\nSenate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) heads for votes at the Capitol on Feb. 18 in Washington, D.C.

At the same time, that’s up to the Russian people. That’s not up to us to make that decision,” Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday.\\n\\nPutin has not held free and fair elections in Russia for decades, and is known for imprisoning his critics. Mullin did not provide an example of Trump criticizing the Russian autocrat.\\n\\n“I will reiterate: Vladimir Putin is a vile dictator and thug, and he is clearly responsible for the war in Ukraine,” Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.), who serves on the Foreign Affairs Committee, told ABC’s “This Week.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“Russia, China and Iran have been working in a coordinated effort to undermine and destabilize the United States, Europe, Israel and the free world,” he continued. “They are not our allies or our friends, and we must be clear-eyed about that.”\\n\\n“We’re going to undercut the Ukrainians... Oh, and by the way, we’re going to get their precious minerals at the bargain rate prices as a threat to do even worse,” Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), who is part of the Armed Services Committee, told ABC’s “This Week.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“This is not a statesman or a diplomat,” he continued. “This is just someone who admires Putin, does not believe in the struggle of the Ukrainians and is committed to cozying up to an autocrat.”\\n\\n“Essentially, this is the President Trump surrendering to the Russians … This is not a statesman or a diplomat.

It was provoked,” Steve Witkoff, U.S. special envoy to the Mideast, told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “It doesn’t necessarily mean it was provoked by the Russians. There were all kinds of conversations back then about Ukraine joining NATO. The president has spoken about this, that didn’t need to happen. It basically became a threat to the Russians.”\\n\\nLawler said that while he does not agree with Trump’s characterization of Zelenskyy, he hopes that the Ukrainian leader would understand that, essentially, he would have to bow his head to Trump and cooperate if he wants to keep receiving U.S. assistance. The congressman also excused the Trump administration’s discussion with Russia over a possible deal, saying that no agreement can logically be made without bringing Moscow to the table.\\n\\n“I have been very clear in my support for Ukraine,” Lawler said. “But this kind of back and forth, saying that the president is falling for Russian disinformation, does not help his cause for sure.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy speaks at a forum of government officials in Kyiv on Feb. 23.

       "   'content': \"LOADING ERROR LOADING\\n\\nOn the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, President Donald Trump has sparked concern by spreading falsehoods undermining the country, pointing to a major shift in U.S. policy.\\n\\nTrump, who campaigned on a promise of ending the war as soon as he took office, set off alarm bells in both Kyiv and Europe earlier this month after announcing he held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, effectively ending Moscow’s isolation from the West.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSince then, Trump has echoed the Kremlin’s talking points, sidelining Kyiv, a prominent U.S. ally. Trump has called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “dictator without elections,” said the country was responsible for provoking the war, and excluded Kyiv and its European allies from U.S.-Russia talks on ending the conflict.\\n\\nTrump’s moves solidify Europe’s fears that the U.S. no longer has the continent’s back and suggest that he underestimates America’s interest in supporting Ukraine in the war.\\n\\nEurope Braces For Change\\n\\nWhile Trump appeared to take credit for the victory of Germany’s conservative Christian Democratic Union on Sunday evening, the party’s leader Friedrich Merz, who is expected to become the next chancellor, criticized the efforts of Elon Musk, the U.S. president’s billionaire ally, to sway the election in favor of the far-right Alternative for Germany party.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“The interventions from Washington were no less dramatic and drastic and ultimately outrageous than the interventions we have seen from Moscow,” Merz said, according to Politico. “We are under such massive pressure from two sides that my absolute priority now really is to create unity in Europe.”\\n\\nMerz added that what was previously unthinkable is now the reality that Europe must come to terms with.\\n\\n“After Donald Trump’s statements last week at the latest, it is clear that the Americans, at least this part of the Americans, this administration, are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe,” Merz said, according to the outlet.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMerz’s statements will undoubtedly loom large on the minds of fellow Europeans French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who are set to meet Trump this week in Washington, hoping to persuade the president against abandoning Kyiv.\\n\\nUkraine Is Left To Grapple With Trump’s Pro-Putin Rhetoric\\n\\nBoth Europe and Zelenskyy have had to grapple with the evolution of the U.S. position on the war. While former President Joe Biden had pledged to support Ukraine for “as long as it takes,” Trump has made clear he will not tolerate the continuation of the conflict.\\n\\nWhile many share Trump’s desire, Ukraine supporters worry the president’s recent shocking statements indicate he will force the country into an unfavorable deal.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTrump last week took issue with Ukraine’s criticism of the White House’s decision to not invite Kyiv to participate in talks between top U.S. and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia, before claiming that Ukraine was responsible for the war prompted by Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\\n\\n“Well, you’ve been there for three years. You should’ve ended it in three years,” he said. “You should have never started it. You could have made a deal.”\\n\\nHe also later lashed out at Zelenskyy, calling him a “dictator without elections,” ignoring that the country’s elections were suspended due to the war. Interestingly, Trump had nothing to say about Putin, an authoritarian leader whose country hasn’t had free or fair elections in decades.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhy Trump’s Approach May Be Shortsighted\\n\\nTrump’s decision to antagonize traditional U.S. allies who have supported the U.S. for years while courting Russia could come back to haunt him, Marc Polymeropoulos, a former CIA senior intelligence service officer, writes.\\n\\n“It will now be impossible for anyone to trust the U.S. as an ally,” Polymeropoulos writes for MSNBC.\\n\\n“Is this what Trump wants as his legacy? Does ‘America First’ really mean ‘America the Betrayer’?” Polymeropoulos asked.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTrump’s approach could also diminish America’s influence.\\n\\n“Some of them may say, ‘We need nuclear weapons of our own,’ or ‘We’re just going to disregard what Washington says,’ because Washington now has become so unpredictable and self-interested,” Richard Haass, the president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations and director of policy planning under former President George W. Bush, told NPR of U.S. allies.\\n\\n“We’re moving towards a much less American-centric world,” he added.\\n\\nEven if some may argue Trump’s apparent effort to inch closer to Putin is a calculated move to break up the Kremlin’s alliance with China — a U.S. adversary that the Trump administration appears to be more concerned about — it’s unclear if Putin would be ready to abandon the partnership that has helped sustain his war effort.\\n\\nGo Ad-Free — And Protect The Free Press The next four years will change America forever.

As The Washington Post reported, the Trump administration’s delegation did not stand with the United States’ traditional democratic allies.\\n\\nThe United States voted with Russia, North Korea, Belarus and 14 other Moscow-friendly countries Monday on a resolution condemning Russian aggression in Ukraine and calling for its occupied territory to be returned that passed overwhelmingly in the U.N. General Assembly on Monday.\\n\\nAs NBC News reported, the United States actually lobbied countries around the world to oppose the resolution brought by Ukraine and European countries.\\n\\nIn fairness, I should mention that the Trump administration’s diplomatic team also opposed a Russian amendment related to the “root causes” of the war that Russia started, but that doesn’t change the fact that, ahead of Inauguration Day 2025, the United States would’ve backed the resolution championed by our allies and not voted with Russia and North Korea.\\n\\nNow, that’s no longer the case.\\n\\nIf this sounds at all familiar, it’s not your imagination. We learned last week that our G7 allies also drafted a resolution that described Russia as the aggressor in the war with Ukraine, and the Trump administration reportedly edited the draft, removing phrases that “could be interpreted as being pro-Ukraine.”\\n\\nThis also coincides with several key figures from the Trump administration and the White House appearing on Sunday shows and refusing to say that Russia started the war in Ukraine.\\n\\nThis came on the heels of Trump lying about “missing” money the United States sent to Ukraine in the form of aid.\\n\\nWhich came on the heels of Trump repeatedly labeling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a “dictator.”\\n\\nWhich came on the heels of Trump accusing Ukraine of “starting” the war that Russia started.\\n\\nWhich came on the heels of Trump excluding Ukrainian officials from diplomatic talks about Ukraine’s future.\\n\\nWhich came on the heels of Trump vouching for Vladimir Putin’s trustworthiness and interest in “peace.”\\n\\nWhich came on the heels of Trump saying he’s prepared to reward Russia by welcoming it back into the G7.\\n\\nWhich came on the heels of allegations that Trump, during his first term, secretly sent Covid-19 testing equipment to Putin at the height of the pandemic, even as people in his own country struggled to gain access to such resources.

       "   'content': 'The United States is doing it again: walking away from allies. It is almost as if each U.S. presidency needs to practice betrayal as a form of statecraft. The examples of men and women who counted on our support are many. George H.W. Bush with the Kurds. Barack Obama with the Syrians. Donald Trump and Joe Biden with the Afghans. And now, Trump with the Ukrainians. America, the dependable ally, we are not.\\n\\nI served as a U.S. intelligence officer in the field, often in dangerous conflict zones from Iraq to Syria to Afghanistan. I retired before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but as the Trump administration abandons this former American ally, PTSD is setting in for many of my ilk: the actual operational practitioners of U.S. foreign policy. We were “on the ground,” far from Congress and the Situation Room, far from think tanks and academic institutions. We were the first ones in, parachuted into conflicts with the implication that the proverbial cavalry would be on the way shortly.\\n\\nThis clear policy shift is nevertheless subtle enough that many Americans may not understand it.\\n\\nMy U.S. government colleagues and I were upfront and personal with our allies, whoever they were. At times, we were even in harm’s way, just like our allies. We lived side by side with them, broke bread with them, rejoiced in their successes and mourned their deaths. We made grand promises, offered platitudes and provided assistance — at least initially. Yet so often there is no fairy-tale ending, as time and time again politicians decided that the going had gotten too tough or that political expediency outweighed morality.\\n\\nI once told a four-star U.S. Army general that I was lucky to work with the finest fighting force in eastern Afghanistan. He looked around puzzled, seeing no U.S. troops at the small front-line paramilitary base where we were standing. But I was singing the praises of the group of Afghan Indigenous fighters whom we were on the way to inspect. The general was not amused, yet no truer comment could ever have been said about the bravery of the Afghans. But years after the hasty U.S. withdrawal from their country, many of those who helped fight the Taliban are still on the run. Tens of thousands of interpreters, engineers and other noncombatant allies have been left behind to face starvation, poverty and retribution.\\n\\nMany of us, however, thought Ukraine would really be different. This was a classic story of right versus wrong, of “David vs. Goliath,” and the U.S. did come to Ukraine’s aid once Russian forces were on the move. Since then, Ukraine has exacted hundreds of thousands of casualties on the Russian invaders. Behind the scenes, the U.S. has reportedly provided critical military and intelligence assistance — without a drop of U.S. blood shed.\\n\\nDid the U.S. do enough? No. Biden’s fear of possible escalation with Russia squandered too many opportunities, to the immense frustration of Ukraine, its soldiers and its supporters. But $60 billion in aid is not small potatoes. The Ukrainians fight valiantly and bravely, proving time and again that they would never be defeated. With the backing of the world’s greatest superpower, anything was possible.\\n\\nYet now, the Trump administration appears eager to walk away from Ukraine. Details of exactly how remain murky. The president and those around him are not talking with one voice. Trump says one thing one day, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth another, Vice President JD Vance and special envoy Keith Kellogg something else the next. Yet one thing appears abundantly clear: The U.S. is not an ally of Ukraine any longer. At best, America is now a neutral party, and at worst complicit in its demise.\\n\\nOur adversaries even now must be celebrating; there are surely open vodka bottles in the Kremlin.\\n\\nThis clear policy shift is nevertheless subtle enough that many Americans may not understand it. But for Ukrainians, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in particular, there is no doubt about the United States’ intentions. At the Munich Security Conference last week, Zelenskyy repeatedly pleaded that Ukraine needs the U.S. to support it against Russia, not to mediate between the two. Not only was Trump unpersuaded, he blamed Ukraine for starting the war — an allegation that is of course patently false.\\n\\nTrust is so hard to gain, and yet so easily lost. And though some of the Trump team’s errors — such as Hegseth’s statement that Ukraine would never join NATO — were walked back, the damage is already done. Each concession to Russia gives Russian President Vladimir Putin a victory even before negotiations begin. One former U.S. senior intelligence officer told me that Ukraine, even in the best-case scenario, will look now at the U.S. from the vantage of a spouse scorned by infidelity.\\n\\nI have spoken with numerous retired U.S. national security practitioners who have worked globally countering Russian aggression, including those who spent the last decade in and out of Ukraine, asking them what the recent U.S. policy change personally meant to them. Often there is a long silence. Then a sigh. A former intelligence officer said his thoughts immediately went to the scores of Ukrainians with whom he worked — their incredible sense of resolve and will to fight. Some have recently visited Ukraine to make contact with old friends. It was difficult for them to look old Ukrainian partners in the eye as the U.S. shifts from ally to neutral player, or maybe worse.\\n\\nMy former colleagues’ thoughts shifted to the future as well. Many stated that this betrayal was the big one: epic in its scope, with far-reaching consequences for the next fight, likely with China. The fallout will be even worse than the Afghans left to fend for themselves. It will now be impossible for anyone to trust the U.S. as an ally. Our adversaries even now must be celebrating; there are surely open vodka bottles in the Kremlin.\\n\\nIs this what Trump wants as his legacy? Does “America First” really mean “America the Betrayer”? Or will this White House come to its senses, stop pushing for an unjust peace deal and actually allow Ukrainians agency in their future?'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Leading up to a vote Monday, the United States had been lobbying countries around the world to oppose a resolution brought forward at the United Nations General Assembly by Ukraine and European countries on the third anniversary of the war in Ukraine and support a U.S. draft resolution instead.\\n\\nBut ultimately, after European countries won support for three amendments to the U.S. resolution, the Trump administration was forced to abstain from its own resolution.\\n\\nThe amendments replaced language referring to “the Russian Federation-Ukraine conflict” with “the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation”; added a commitment to Ukraine’s territorial integrity within internationally recognized borders; and expanded wording about a “lasting peace” between Ukraine and Russia to a “just, lasting and comprehensive peace,” “in line with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States.”\\n\\n“These amendments pursue a war of words rather than an end to the war,” U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Dorothy Shea said shortly before the vote. “The attempt to add this language detracts from what we are trying to achieve with this forward-looking resolution, a firm consensus from the members of this body to unite behind a resolution calling for the end to this conflict.”\\n\\nDespite the lack of U.S. support, the U.S. resolution with the new language was adopted by the U.N. General Assembly with 93 votes in favor, eight against and 73 abstentions.\\n\\nUkraine’s competing resolution co-sponsored by European countries also passed despite active U.S. opposition with 93 votes in favor, 18 against and 65 abstentions. The U.S. was among the 18 countries that voted against the resolution, including Russia, North Korea, Belarus and Sudan. China and Saudi Arabia were among the 65 countries that abstained.\\n\\nAn internal memo sent to all U.S. diplomatic posts Saturday had instructed the head of each U.S. mission to “engage host governments at the highest possible levels,” and urge them to support the U.S. resolution and encourage Ukraine to withdraw its own resolution, “which does not advance the United States’ goal of achieving a lasting peace.”\\n\\nThe U.S. will once again ask the world to support its resolution Monday afternoon at the U.N. Security Council, where it will be able to veto any amendments to its language brought forward by other members.\\n\\nU.S. diplomats were also told to ask countries to vote against a proposed Russian amendment to the U.S. resolution, according to the diplomatic note seen by NBC News. The Russian amendment would add language saying that the “root causes” of the conflict should also be addressed.\\n\\nThe memo was first reported by Reuters.\\n\\nUkraine’s resolution, which it put forward last week, demands the immediate withdrawal of Russian forces “from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.” The U.S. does not support that demand and Trump administration officials have recently suggested that Ukraine would likely have to give up some territory as part of a peace deal.\\n\\nUkraine’s resolution also refers to the ongoing hostilities as a “war,” a word that is omitted from the text of the U.S. resolution, and which Russia has stayed away from since it invaded Ukraine in 2022.\\n\\n“President Trump is committed to ending the Russia-Ukraine war and to a resolution that leads to a lasting peace, not just a temporary pause,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement Friday. “The United States has proposed a simple, historic resolution in the United Nations that we urge all member states to support in order to chart a path to peace.”'},\n",

       "   'content': 'The United Nations general assembly has backed a resolution drafted by Ukraine and the European Union condemning Russia on the third anniversary of its full-scale invasion, spurning a rival US resolution reflecting Donald Trump’s split with Europe and growing union with Vladimir Putin.\\n\\nThe United States, Russia, Belarus and North Korea all voted against the EU-Ukrainian resolution underlining an extraordinary shift in US policy since the US president’s election that has largely absolved the Russian president of responsibility for the invasion.\\n\\nIn the vote, 93 countries supported the joint European resolution that named Russia an aggressor state and called on it to remove its troops from Ukraine, while 18 countries including the US and Russia voted against.\\n\\nThe vote came as Trump met with Emmanuel Macron at the White House on Monday and the two spoke with G7 leaders to discuss peace talks to end the war and the growing gulf between Washington and European capitals over the future of the Nato alliance.\\n\\nGermany’s likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, warned this weekend that Europe should seek greater independence from the United States and said it was an “absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA”.\\n\\nMacron told reporters outside the White House that the G7 call was “perfect” but did not offer other details. Trump released a statement in which he said that all members of the G7 had said they wanted to achieve peace and that the war would never have happened if he had been president.\\n\\nTrump has quickly moved to direct talks with Putin that have eschewed Ukraine and has also sought to strong-arm Kyiv into a “critical minerals and rare-earths deal” to recoup the cost of US support for Ukraine in the three years since Putin launched his full-scale invasion.\\n\\n“I am in serious discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia concerning the ending of the War, and also major Economic Development transactions which will take place between the United States and Russia,” Trump said on Monday. “Talks are proceeding very well!”\\n\\nThe UN votes on Monday were mostly symbolic. The US resolution was three paragraphs long and did not include any mention of Russia aggression, saying it “implores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and the Russian Federation”. The Russian ambassador to the UN had called the US resolution a “good move”.\\n\\nThe US sought a “simple, historic statement from the general assembly that looks forward, not backwards”, said Ambassador Dorothy Shea, the US chargé d’affaires at the UN. “A resolution focused on one, simple idea: ending the war. A path to peace is possible.\\n\\n“Mr President, that is why the United States opposed putting forward another resolution,” she continued. “And that is why we cannot support Ukraine’s resolution, and we urge its withdrawal in favor of a strong statement committing us to end the war and work towards a lasting peace.”\\n\\nThe US proposal did not call for a ceasefire or any concrete action because it believed that would increase resistance from Russia and Ukraine. Asked by a reporter if the US was seeking “global support for vague peace”, one state department official responded: “Absolutely. That’s what the UN is all about.”\\n\\n“This is a simple way to begin to acknowledge, and for everyone who agrees, that this is ending,” another official clarified.\\n\\nThe US had sought to kill the Ukrainian co-sponsored resolution, and US diplomats had pressured EU and Ukrainian officials in foreign capitals this weekend to withdraw their resolution before Monday’s vote, according to cables to US embassies and reports in US media.\\n\\nState department officials speaking on background said that the US was in discussions with the UK and France just hours before a vote in the UN security council on a resolution calling for peace that has been broadly dismissed by Ukraine and European countries as whitewashing Russia’s invasion of the country.\\n\\n“President Trump is committed to ending the Russia-Ukraine war and to a resolution that leads to a lasting peace, not just a temporary pause,” the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said in a statement on Friday. “The United States has proposed a simple, historic resolution in the United Nations that we urge all member states to support in order to chart a path to peace.”\\n\\nThe UN vote was preceded by a diplomatic scramble that saw both EU and US diplomats seeking to shore up support from countries in Africa, Asia and South America.\\n\\n“We have been doing what we do as diplomats, which is going to capitals, a lot of engagement over the weekend from our career professional diplomats who are in each one of the capitals,” said a state department official. “We have seen several countries switch from removing their co-sponsorship of the Ukrainian resolution to support for the United States resolution. We are continuing that diplomacy relentlessly, and that will continue until we have a vote.”'},\n",

They included the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and Finland’s president, Alexander Stubb. Twenty-four joined online.\\n\\nThe coordinated Europe-led show of solidarity came after a torrid week, in which Donald Trump blamed Ukraine for starting the war against Russia, described Zelenskyy as a “dictator without elections”, and made it clear Europe would have to enforce and pay for any future peace settlement.\\n\\nThere was strong collective pushback against the US president’s upside down version of recent history and a consensus that Ukraine had to take part in negotiations over its future. “The war is against Ukraine. So Ukraine has to be at the negotiating table,” Zelenskyy told the visiting leaders, saying Europe had to be there, too. He added: “Peace can’t be declared or announced.”\\n\\nUS and Russian negotiators are due to hold a second round of talks soon, after a meeting last week in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. The White House has said the war could end “this week” – raising fears that a quick US-Russia deal will echo Vladimir Putin’s demands that Ukraine cede territory and capitulate.\\n\\nAt least seven European countries announced significant new packages of economic and military support to Kyiv on Monday, with von der Leyen promising a €3.5bn (£2.9bn) payment. The Trump administration has indicated that US weapons deliveries will probably stop and has said Ukraine will have to repay any future military assistance at double the actual price.\\n\\nSeveral EU leaders acknowledged the continent had to spend more on its own security and – as the Irish taoiseach, Micheál Martin, put it – “do more and talk less”. Lithuania’s defence minister, Dovilė Šakalienė, said Trump’s repeated demand for greater spending from fellow Nato member states was a necessary but “painful kick”.\\n\\nShe added that the “unpleasant” events of the last week, when Trump repeated Kremlin talking points and apparently dumped Ukraine as an ally, had changed the psychology of European decision-making. “When you feel your own arse is on fire, you move faster,” she said.\\n\\nView image in fullscreen World leaders stand either side of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his wife, Olena, in Kyiv.

The country could join the EU before 2030, von der Leyen said, if Kyiv continued its reforms at their current speed and quality.\\n\\nSitting next to the Ukrainian president, Stubb, the Finnish president, said it was not up to Russia to determine which alliances Kyiv joined, or the shape of the European security order. “Putin lost this war. We will see Ukraine in Europe and in Nato,” he said.\\n\\nJustin Trudeau reaffirmed Canada’s support “until the war is over and Ukraine wins”.\\n\\nHours after world leaders arrived, air raid sirens rang out across the capital. Early on Sunday, Russia carried out its biggest aerial raid since its 24 February 2022 all-out attack, sending 267 drones across Ukraine’s border. At least four people were killed in strikes across the country.\\n\\nOn Monday, Zelenskyy, his wife, Olena, and prime ministers and presidents laid candles at a popular memorial in the centre of Kyiv to soldiers and civilians killed in Russia’s war.

It’s Europe’s destiny.”\\n\\nZelenskyy wrote in his anniversary address: “Three years of absolute heroism by our people. Eternal gratitude to the fallen heroes.”\\n\\nKeir Starmer said the UK supported a “just and lasting peace for Ukraine”, adding that: “We face a once-in-a-generation moment for our collective security and values.” The British prime minister has said UK troops could be sent to Ukraine as part of a possible peacekeeping contingent, on condition the US provided a “backstop”. “Russia does not hold all the cards in this war,” Starmer told Zelenskyy by video.\\n\\nThe White House has categorically ruled out sending US troops to Ukraine and it is unclear what a backstop means. The Labour MP Alex Sobel said Nato countries could provide air support and impose a no-fly zone – an idea proposed in 2022.

He said Zelenskky should sign a $500bn (£395bn) minerals deal with the US, arguing this would give the White House a direct stake in protecting Ukraine and its own business interests. Zelenskky has so far resisted and on Sunday said he did not “recognise” the $500bn figure.\\n\\n“Trump wants to show something to his Ukraine-sceptic Republican base,” Johnson said. He added: “The tragedy is that he [Trump] has been listening for too long to [the conservative political commentator] Tucker Carlson, who has been taking the Kremlin line.

Sign up for it here.\\n\\nA quarter century ago, Vladimir Putin gathered 21 of Russia’s top oligarchs in the Kremlin to let them know that he, not they, held power in Russia. The young Russian president (not yet for life) informed them that they could keep the wealth they’d amassed if they complied with his political goals. Partnership with Putin held out the prospect of safety, and even greater riches. “We received confirmation,” an attendee named Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky said, “that the development of Russian business is one of the state’s top priorities.”\\n\\nExplore the Special Preview: April 2025 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More\\n\\nMost of the oligarchs submitted, but those who didn’t went to prison or into exile, lest they fall prey to the country’s epidemic of window-plunging deaths. (Khodorkovsky was imprisoned, putatively for fraud and tax evasion, but really for supporting independent media and opposition parties.) Since then, affinity for Putin has been a sine qua non of high-level economic success in Russia.\\n\\nAn eerily reminiscent scene played out late last year at Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump’s Winter Palace, where Stephen Miller, one of Trump’s loyalty enforcers, met with Meta’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. The weather was more pleasant, and presumably neither party contemplated defenestration as a settlement alternative, but many other details seemed to echo. “Mr. Miller told Mr. Zuckerberg that he had an opportunity to help reform America, but it would be on President-elect Donald J. Trump’s terms,” The New York Times reported. Because Trump had recently warned, “We are watching [Zuckerberg] closely, and if he does anything illegal” during Trump’s second term, “he will spend the rest of his life in prison,” this opportunity must have sounded enticing. Zuckerberg indicated that he would not in any way obstruct Trump’s agenda, according to the Times, and foisted blame for any prior offenses onto subordinates.\\n\\nBy the time Trump assumed power, Zuckerberg was lavishing him with praise. “We now have a U.S. administration that is proud of our leading companies,” he gushed of the man who had once threatened him with prison, “that prioritizes American technology winning. And that will defend our values and interests abroad.” His rehabilitation complete, Zuckerberg assumed a place of pride at Trump’s inauguration, alongside Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and other titans of industry. His eyes were now on the future, and the promised Trumpian Golden Age.\\n\\nThe president’s public communion with the business titans who have submitted to him has been analyzed as a signal of his authoritarianism and his alliance with the rich. But it also reveals another emerging aspect of Trumpism: his rejection of the capitalist principles that ultimately generate prosperity.\\n\\nTrump has never believed in the invisible hand—in leaving people alone to pursue self-interest in a free market; in letting market forces allocate capital and arbitrate any given company’s success or failure. Nor does he even believe in traditional mercantilist protection. He believes, like Putin, in political control of the economy’s commanding heights—success for those executives and companies who please him, failure for those who don’t. And he seems to be seeking that control more actively than he did in 2016.\\n\\nAlready, Trump’s words and actions have brought about a psychological transformation within the executive class. Presidents and business leaders have sometimes tangled, or formed partnerships, but the combination of fear and solicitousness that Trump now commands is wholly new.\\n\\nAfter the election, The Wall Street Journal reported, businesses began looking at steps such as “buying the Trump family’s cryptocurrency token” and scrubbing their websites of Democratic-friendly language. Stanley Black & Decker took down an old post-insurrection statement saying it would “use our voice to advocate for our democracy and a peaceful transition of power,” and donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund. A steel executive hoping to win Trump’s approval to purchase U.S. Steel held a press conference in Butler, Pennsylvania—a holy site in the MAGA universe since the assassination attempt at a rally there in July—where he declared, “America First!”\\n\\nBezos has not renewed his financial support for the Science Based Targets initiative, which works with businesses looking to cut emissions. After Trump gave Musk, the largest donor to his campaign, a limitless portfolio to reshape federal policy, businesses began to see Musk’s commercial empire as a route to political favor too, as the Financial Times noted in February. Visa struck a payment-processing deal with Musk’s controversial social-media site, X, while Amazon boosted its planned marketing there. Musk’s former rivals hastily reconsidered their rivalries: JPMorganChase dropped a lawsuit against Tesla (the company said the timing was coincidental), and Jamie Dimon announced on CNBC that he had “hugged it out” with Musk after a long feud.\\n\\nThe Journal, as America’s most prominent business paper, has documented this cultural transformation in remarkably clear terms. Sentences like this began appearing regularly after the election: “Executives across the corporate sphere are working to get in the good graces of the new administration” (November). “Titans of the business world are rushing to make inroads with the president-elect, gambling that personal relationships with the next occupant of the Oval Office will help their bottom lines and spare them from Trump’s wrath” (December). “Companies seeking Trump’s favor have plenty to gain” (January). The newspaper that American capitalists consult to find out how to run their businesses is informing them that they must gain Trump’s favor if they want to get ahead.\\n\\nIt would be naive to depict this behavior as totally novel. For decades, big companies have spent great sums on lobbying, and their executives have long made pilgrimages to Washington to advance their interests. And they’ve often gotten results.\\n\\nBut Trump appears to be ushering in a change not only in the degree of government favoritism, but also in kind. And the velocity of the transformation, coming as it does alongside a cascade of tumbling norms, can obscure how differently he is operating.\\n\\nThe change can be seen most blatantly in the media industry, which has drawn Trump’s gaze more than any other. Bezos, the owner of The Washington Post, and Patrick Soon-Shiong, who owns the Los Angeles Times, spiked endorsements of Kamala Harris, claiming they would give off the appearance of bias, but then after the election made personal statements praising Trump or his Cabinet picks, as if that somehow wouldn’t. Since then, several major companies have settled lawsuits that Trump had brought against them, and that likely would have been defeated if not laughed out of court. ABC, owned by Disney, donated $15 million to Trump’s presidential library to settle his complaint that George Stephanopoulos had described Trump as having been found liable for rape (he was found liable for sexual abuse). After incoming Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr warned Paramount executives that their merger bid could be at risk because of Trump’s anger at CBS, which Paramount owns, the network reportedly began talks to settle a frivolous $10 billion lawsuit complaining that 60 Minutes had edited out unflattering portions of its interview with Harris. Even after the presiding judge expressed extreme skepticism at the merits of Trump’s lawsuit against Meta for suspending him from Facebook after the January 6 insurrection—a right it clearly possessed as a private entity—Zuckerberg offered up $25 million in penance.\\n\\nRead: Trump says the corrupt part out loud\\n\\nPutting the screws to media owners in particular, especially early on, seems to follow the same playbook that Putin and other strongmen have used to consolidate their power. So does finding opportunities for personal enrichment along the way. (Putin, a lifelong public servant, has become one of the world’s wealthiest men.) Filing weak or groundless lawsuits and expecting his targets to settle for fear of government retribution appears to be a perfectly legal way for Trump to collect baksheesh.\\n\\nAlthough Trump has so far devoted the most attention to media businesses, he has not ignored the broader economy. Every economic-policy decision he makes is a potential weapon to punish dissent or reward his friends, beginning with tariffs.\\n\\nDavid Frum: The price America will pay for Trump’s tariffs\\n\\nTrump has never described himself as a free-market purist, and his enthusiasm for levying imports is his best-known deviation from his party’s traditional economic philosophy. This impulse is often described as a protectionist instinct, aimed at helping shield key industries or American businesses generally. But in fact, Trump’s tariff strategy, if you want to call it that, hardly advances any coherent economic goal. He has threatened tariffs on countries for non-economic reasons, and levied tariffs on industrial inputs, such as aluminum and copper, that make American industries less, not more, competitive by raising their costs. Trump apparently believes that tariffs are borne by foreigners, and are therefore an untapped source of free money from overseas. He enjoys the idea of using them as levers to extract diplomatic concessions as well.\\n\\nTrump brings together the least attractive elements of capitalism and socialism, fusing heavy-handed state control with high inequality.\\n\\nBut Trump has also used tariffs to gain personal and political leverage over American businesses. During his first term, Trump levied broad tariffs and then entertained a parade of executives pleading for exemptions, which his administration doled out at its whim. The Office of the United States Trade Representative fielded more than 50,000 requests from domestic businesses for exceptions to the tariffs on Chinese goods alone, while the Commerce Department sifted through almost half a million waiver requests. Trump’s decisions were often arbitrary—Bibles got a tariff exception, on the apparent basis that their costs needed to stay low, but textbooks did not.\\n\\nOne study of the exceptions, published by the Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, found that firms that had donated to Trump or hired staff from his administration were more likely to receive tariff exceptions. The tariffs, and the ability to hand out exceptions without any oversight or method, were “a very effective spoils system allowing the administration of the day to reward its political friends and punish its enemies,” the authors concluded.\\n\\nA 2019 investigation by the Commerce Department’s inspector general reported “the appearance of improper influence in decision-making” in the waiver process. In his second term, Trump has managed to solve this problem—if you define problem as the exposure of corruption rather than its existence—by firing, to date, the inspectors general at 18 federal agencies, including Commerce.\\n\\nTrump’s greatest advantage in this regard is that he has never professed adherence to any standard of fairness. When he discusses his plans to regulate businesses, or reward them with tax breaks, he does so in nakedly transactional terms. The business community understands that every decision the federal government makes, whether it involves antitrust enforcement or taxation or criminal justice, will be meted out on the basis of Trump’s political and personal whims. Trump does not even pretend otherwise, because the pretense would undermine his power.\\n\\nPresidents may not be angels. But they used to follow a general presumption of leaving the task of picking winners and losers to the private sector. They likewise observed a wall between public and private interest that we can barely recognize today.\\n\\nSeventy-two years ago, President Dwight Eisenhower selected Charlie Wilson, the head of General Motors, as his defense secretary. Skeptical members of Congress quizzed Wilson as to how he would put aside residual loyalty to his former company. Wilson confessed, “For years I thought what was good for the country was good for General Motors, and vice versa.” The confession scandalized the country. Although Wilson was trying to say that General Motors benefited from national prosperity, the very possibility that he might conflate the interests of his former employer with those of the country was beyond the pale.\\n\\nFrom the April 2018 issue: Is Big Business really that bad?\\n\\nAt the moment, large swaths of government policy are being dictated by the current CEO of a car company. And yet it is unfathomable that the Trump administration would deem Elon Musk’s dual role unethical, let alone demand that he step down from Tesla and his other companies as a condition of public service. Musk, like Trump, respects no distinction between his personal financial interests, those of his political party, and those of the country. The seamless connection between political power and personal wealth tells everybody who belongs to the upper class or aspires to it that their safest path is to join the ruling claque.\\n\\nThis is alarming for any number of reasons. But, not least among them, it violates the key precept of any free-enterprise system: that market competition dictates which businesses succeed or fail. Through innovation and creative destruction, this kind of competition yields national prosperity.\\n\\nThe nature of Trump’s economic vision—populist? nationalist? traditional conservative?—has been the subject of endless debate. The reality is that he brings together the least attractive elements of capitalism and socialism, fusing heavy-handed state control with high inequality, and entrenching a set of oligarchs who serve simultaneously as the ruling party’s victims and co-conspirators. The more that political favor displaces market competition as the basis of corporate success, the worse things will get.\\n\\nIt may seem to Americans influenced by Trump’s well-crafted persona as a business genius or lulled by the record of his first term (when he inherited a growing economy) that he will bring some pro-business magic to his second term. Yet favoring incumbent businesses (as long as they stay on his good side) is not the same as favoring healthy free markets. Putin is in some ways a great ally of Russian business, and the country’s economic elite supports him, but Russia’s economy should be seen by intelligent advocates of capitalism as a vision of hell.\\n\\nThe end point of Trump’s vision for the economy would be unrecognizable to generations of innovators. It would sacrifice the openness and opportunity that make America the most enticing destination for entrepreneurs across the world, while locking into place and even celebrating excesses of wealth. If Americans think that by empowering Trump, they have traded away some of their equality, civic decency, and political freedom for prosperity, we may find one day that we have sacrificed them all.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'The scene in Kyiv earlier this month recalled the darkest days of oligarchic rule. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent slipped a piece of paper across the table to Volodmyr Zelensky. “You really need to sign this,” Bessent told the Ukrainian president, according to The Wall Street Journal. The document was a deal to give the United States the rights to hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of Ukraine’s minerals. When Zelensky said that he needed time to consider the proposal, Bessent pushed the paper closer to him and warned that “people back in Washington” would be very upset.\\n\\nThe Trump administration was operating in the old spirit of the kleptocrats who built fortunes in Ukraine and Russia at the dawn of the post-Communist era, wielding veiled threats to bully the nation’s leader into hastily handing over precious resources in a shady deal.\\n\\nTo Zelensky’s credit, he did his best to resist Bessent’s pressure. “I can’t sell our state,” he explained. It was as if he had actually internalized the message that American diplomats from the Bush, Obama, and Biden administrations had attempted to drum into Ukraine’s collective psyche: Ukraine’s democracy depends on it resisting powerful business interests that seek to plunder its wealth on terms highly unfavorable to the Ukrainian public. Zelensky’s willingness to stand up to President Donald Trump, holding true to American values in the face of American intimidation, was a perverse trading of places.\\n\\nAnne Applebaum: The end of the postwar world\\n\\nThe moment recalls another episode in Ukraine’s recent past. Three years ago today, Russian troops streamed across the nation’s borders, assassins descended on the capital in search of its president, citizens decamped to the subways in search of shelter. Western intelligence agencies predicted Ukraine’s imminent demise. And in that moment of despair, Zelensky strode out into the empty streets of Kyiv, in the dark of night, to record a video reassuring the world, “We are still here.”\\n\\nIn those initial days of the war, Zelensky began to pose as a defender of liberalism, fighting on behalf of global democracy. Whether he actually meant it wasn’t clear. Before the war, his record of curbing corruption was spotty at best. With his political inexperience, and his strange unwillingness to prepare his country against the looming Russian threat, the former comic actor hardly had the makings of a sturdy bulwark against autocracy.\\n\\nBut he became one in the face of an unrelenting assault. Having preserved his nation’s independence, however, he’s now facing not one but two of the world’s most powerful illiberal leaders, conspiring in tandem. For reasons both petty and pecuniary, Trump seems intent on fulfilling Russian President Vladimir Putin’s goal of crushing Ukrainian sovereignty. The American president is pressing for Russia’s favored resolution to the war, without even allowing Zelensky a seat at the negotiating table. And the resource deal he’s pursuing amounts to World War I–style reparations, but extracted from the victim of aggression. It would force the Ukrainians to hand over the wealth beneath their ground, without any guarantee of their security in exchange. The extortion that Trump proposes would deny Ukraine any possibility of recovering economically, and consign its people to a state of servitude.\\n\\nPeter Wehner: MAGA has found a new model\\n\\nIn this new moment of crisis, Zelensky is reverting to the role he played in the war’s earliest days. Confronted with blunt force, he’s bravely resisting. Squaring up to the bully, he accused Trump of swimming in disinformation. Despite all the pressure the United States has applied on him to accede to the mineral deal, he’s refused. Yesterday, he said, “I am not signing something that ten generations of Ukrainians will have to repay.” Knowing that Trump will never set aside his personal animosity toward him, he offered to resign in exchange for a Western security guarantee.\\n\\nHe has resisted the administration’s demands despite the fact that he has no leverage in his dealings with the U.S. other than moral suasion and a limited ability to get in Trump’s way. Ukraine’s military is entirely dependent on American arms, and its European allies can do almost nothing, at this late date, to fill the void. In the end, given Ukraine’s tenuous existence, Zelensky might have little choice but to accept whatever Trump imposes, but at least he’s shown that there’s a course other than immediate surrender.\\n\\nQuico Toro: Brazil stood up for its democracy. Why didn’t the United States?\\n\\nOnce upon a time, the United States poured diplomatic resources and military aid into Ukraine so that it wouldn’t descend into Russian-style autocracy. Now it’s the United States that’s headed in that direction. In the form of Elon Musk, an oligarch has captured the power of the American government, through which he can invisibly advance his own interests. The president is attempting to intimidate (and sue) the media into complying with the administration’s agenda. The norms of the administrative state have been shattered so that Trump can reward cronies and punish enemies. And in the most literal sense, the United States is collaborating with Russian autocracy so that the foreign policies of the two regimes are more closely aligned.\\n\\nAmerican institutions have largely faltered amid Trump’s assault, and European allies have aimlessly panicked. But Zelensky’s very presence reprimands the West for its futile opposition; his resoluteness shames Republicans, who once admired him as a latter-day Winston Churchill, for their own abject capitulation. Although he arguably has more to lose from a Trump administration than anyone on the planet, he’s kept pushing back, with resourcefulness that recalls Ukraine’s guerrilla tactics immediately after the Russian invasion. When the history of the era is written, Zelensky will be seen as the global leader of the anti-authoritarian resistance, who refused to accept the terms that the powerful sought to impose on his nation. He clarified the terms of the struggle with his heroic example. He reminds despairing liberals, “We are still here.”'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-23T22:03:46',\n",
       "   'content': \"Last Saturday, I was in Montreal for the Canada-U.S. hockey game in the 4 Nations Cup. I knew I needed to be there. A few nights later, I was at home in front of our TV for the final game, which Canada won 3–2 in overtime. I watched every moment, from before the game began to after it ended. I almost never do that. Those games, I knew, were going to say something—about Canadian players, about Canadian fans, about Canada. Maybe something about the United States too. I didn’t know what.\\n\\nSports can tell big stories. I was one of two goalies for Canada in the Canada–Soviet Union series in 1972, the first international best-against-best hockey series. Until that moment, professional players from the NHL were not eligible to compete in the amateurs-only Olympic Games or World Championships. Canada was where hockey originated, where all of the best players in the world were born and developed. To the total annoyance of Canadians, year after year the Soviet Union, not Canada, became known as “World Champions.”\\n\\nThe 1972 showdown was eight games: four in Canada, four in Moscow. Everyone—the Canadian players and fans, even the Soviet players and fans and the experts from both countries—knew that Canada would win decisively, likely all eight games and by big scores.\\n\\nIn Game 1 in Montreal, the Soviets won, 7–3. Imagine the reaction all across Canada. Then multiply that by 10.\\n\\nInstantly, the stakes changed. Something deeper than hockey pride was on the line. We were the best in the world when it came to hockey; the rest of the world didn’t think about Canada that way when it came to many other things. Now we had lost. What did that say about us? About Canada? About Canadians? The next seven games would decide. These were the stakes.\\n\\nWe left Canada trailing two games to one, with one game tied. We lost the first game in Moscow. The series was all but over. Then we won the next two games, leaving it to one final game. In 1972, not many North Americans traveled to Europe; almost none went to Moscow. Three thousand Canadians were in that arena. They were there because, somehow, they knew they had to be there. For the last game, on a Thursday, played entirely during work and school hours all across the country, 16 million out of Canada’s population of 22 million people watched. Behind two goals to start the third period, we tied the game, then won it, and the series, with 34 seconds remaining. I felt immense excitement. I felt even more immense relief. In that series, Canadians discovered a depth of feeling for their country that they hadn’t known was there.\\n\\nIn 1980, I was the other person in the Olympics booth in Lake Placid, New York, when the U.S. beat the Soviets and won the gold medal. (When Al Michaels said, “Do you believe in miracles? Yes!,” I said, “Unbelievable.”) At the beginning of the Olympics, for the U.S., there were no stakes. The team was made up almost entirely of college kids. The Soviets, at the time, were the best team in the world. Even after the U.S. team won some early games, their players seemed on a roll to enjoy, not to be taken seriously. Then they beat the Soviets and two days later defeated Finland to win the gold.\\n\\nThis was not a good time for the U.S. in the world. Among other problems and conflicts, Iran was holding 52 Americans hostage in Tehran. Weeks passed. The U.S. seemed powerless to get them back. Unbeknownst to all but a few, six of the hostages—all American diplomats—had escaped and were being hidden in the Canadian Embassy. The Canadians sheltered the diplomats for months, and eventually helped them escape. The news that the diplomats had made it safely out of Iran came just before the Lake Placid games began. Everywhere I went around the village, Americans came up to me and said, “Thank you, Canada,” as if they were otherwise friendless in the world.\\n\\nIn 1980, hockey was not a major sport in the U.S., and so Americans had no expectation or even hope of winning against the Soviets. What they did have at stake in 1980 was the Cold War. That they had to win. The hockey team’s victory in Lake Placid felt like part of this bigger fight. It fit the story Americans wanted to tell about themselves. And although hockey was a fairly minor sport, 45 years later, for many Americans, the “Miracle on Ice” remains their favorite patriotic sports moment.\\n\\nNow to today. Now to the 4 Nations Cup. Being Canadian these past few months hasn’t been a lot of fun. The threat and now the coming reality of high tariffs on Canadian goods exported to the U.S.—and the disruptions and dislocations, known and unknown, that these tariffs will cause—is never out of mind. Even more difficult in the day-to-day is Donald Trump’s relentless and insulting commentary.\\n\\nCanada as the U.S.’s “51st state”; Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as “Governor Trudeau”; the U.S. using “economic force” to annex Canada, its nearest ally and inescapable geographical fact of life. It’s the kind of trolling that Trump does to everyone, to every country, whenever he wants to, because as president of the most powerful nation on Earth, he knows he can. He loves to watch the weak wobble and cringe, and those who think they’re strong discover they’re not.\\n\\nNa na na na na. It sets a tone. It lets everyone know who’s boss. It’s what he’d done all his life in business. And although at a boardroom table he wasn’t always the guy with the deepest pockets, in the Oval Office of the United States of America, he knows he is. Being Donald Trump got him elected, but being president is what allows him to be Donald Trump. On November 5, nobody had as much at stake in the election’s result as he did. He needed to win to hold the world’s highest office, to avoid lawsuits and prison time. He needed to win to be him.\\n\\nIt's been amazing to watch world leaders of proud, historically significant countries, kings in their own domain, suck up to Donald Trump, to see billionaires and business titans, who know how the game is played—cater to political authority in public, play hardball in private—who reside proudly and smugly above and beyond politics, fold like a cheap suit. And later, when they do respond, because prime ministers, presidents, and CEOs eventually have to say something, their words sound so lame. “There’s not a snowball’s chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States,” Trudeau said. By answering at all, you end up making any slur sound slightly, disturbingly legitimate, and you make yourself look weak.\\n\\nHow would Americans react if a president or prime minister of another country said the same about their president? That he’s crooked, crazy, a lunatic, a loser? That he’s the worst president in the history of the world? That their country is just another failed empire in its final death throes? That both president and country are a disgrace and everyone knows it? Probably not well.\\n\\nBut what do you do? What do the decision makers in other countries do? What do average Canadians, average Panamanians and Danes, what do ordinary people anywhere do? That’s why I needed to be at that game in Montreal.\\n\\nThirty years earlier, in 1995, on the weekend before Quebec’s second referendum on independence, my family and I went to Montreal to wander the city, to try to sense what Quebeckers were feeling, but mostly just to be there. On a Saturday night, we went to a Montreal Canadiens game. We wanted to be there for the singing of “O Canada.” The next day, a reporter for an English-language newspaper wrote that it was the loudest he had ever heard the anthem sung at a game. What he didn’t notice was that 10,000 people sang their hearts out, and 10,000 people were silent.\\n\\nLast Saturday in Montreal, the arena was filled with fans in red-and-white Canada jerseys. The NHL and the NHL Players Association, which had organized the event, did what organizers do. They asked the fans to be respectful of both teams during the anthems. The fans decided not to be managed. They booed “The Star-Spangled Banner” loudly. They were not booing the American players. They were booing Donald Trump. Why shouldn’t he know how they felt? Why shouldn’t Americans know? How else would they know?\\n\\nFive nights later in Boston, at the final game, the fans booed “O Canada,” but not very loudly.\\n\\nThe game was a classic. The two best teams in the world: Canada, the heart and soul, conscience and bedrock of the game; the U.S., in its development and growth, the great story in hockey in the past 30 years. Both teams played as well as they’d ever played. Their great stars played like great stars; some other players discovered in themselves something even they didn’t know was there. The U.S. could’ve won. The team was good enough to win. Canada won because of Connor McDavid, Nathan MacKinnon, and Sidney Crosby—and for the same reason Canada won against the Soviets in 1972.\\n\\nEverybody, every country, has something inside them that is fundamental. That matters so much that it’s not negotiable. That’s deeply, deeply personal. Something that, if threatened, you’d do anything to protect, and keep on doing it until it’s done, even if it seems to others to make no sense. Even if it seems stupid. This is how wars start.\\n\\nFor Panama, some things are fundamental. For Denmark, China, Russia, Germany, Ukraine, Canada—for everyone—it’s the same. And when you get pushed too much, too far, you rediscover what that fundamental is. Poke the bear and you find out there’s more in the bear than you know, than even the bear knows.\\n\\nFor Canada and these other countries, you don’t poke back against Donald Trump. You don’t troll a troll. You look into yourselves and find again what makes you special, why you matter, to yourselves, to the world, and knowing that, knowing that that is you, with that as your pride and backbone, you fight back.\\n\\nThe U.S. has its own fights. It faces these same questions. What is fundamental to America? “Greatness”? Maybe. But greatness depends on the needs of a country and the needs of the world at a particular moment and time, and being great in the ways that are needed. These next four years will not be easy for anyone—and they will be perhaps especially difficult for the United States.\\n\\nAs for the 51st state crap, knock it off. It’s beneath you.\\n\\nFor Donald Trump, everything is a transaction. You look to make a deal, you push and shove, scratch and claw—you do whatever it takes. And if that doesn’t work, you do some more, until at some point you walk away and make another deal. It’s just business.\\n\\nOnly some things aren’t business. Every so often, Canadians are defiantly not-American. They will need to be much more than that in the next four years. Canadians will need to be defiantly Canadian. Canada won in 1972 and again last week because winning was about more than business. It was personal.\"},\n",

       "   'content': 'Out of all the ugly and dishonest things that Donald Trump said about Volodymyr Zelensky last week, the ugliest was not dishonest at all. “I’ve been watching for years, and I’ve been watching him negotiate with no cards,” Trump said of Zelensky. “He has no cards. And you get sick of it.”\\n\\nSick of it. Stop and think about that phrase. Trump inserted it into a stream of falsehoods, produced over several days, many of which he must have known to be untrue. He has been lying about the origins of the war, about Zelensky’s popular support, about the levels of U.S. funding for Ukraine, about the extent of European funding, about the status of previous negotiations. But sick of it—that, at least, has the ring of truth. Trump is genuinely bored of the war. He doesn’t understand it. He doesn’t know why it started. He doesn’t know how to stop it. He wants to change the channel and watch something else.\\n\\nAlso, he has no cards: That probably reflects Trump’s true belief as well. For Donald Trump, the only real cards are big money and hard power. Players, in his world, are people whom no court can block, no journalist can question, no legislator can oppose. People whose money can buy anything, whose power cannot be checked or balanced.\\n\\nBut Trump is wrong. Zelensky might not have money, and he might not be a brutal dictator like Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping. Yet he does have other kinds of power. He leads a society that organizes itself, with local leaders who have legitimacy and a tech sector dedicated to victory—a society that has come, around the world, to symbolize bravery. He has a message that moves people to act instead of just scaring them into silence.\\n\\nEliot A. Cohen: Incompetence leavened with malignity\\n\\nToday, on the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion, stop and remember what happened on the night it began. I’d had plane tickets to Kyiv that week, but my flights were canceled, and on February 24, 2022, I stayed up and watched the war’s start on television, listening to the sounds of explosions coming from the screen. That night, everyone expected Russia to overrun its much smaller neighbor. But that capitulation never came. Six weeks later, I made it to Kyiv and heard and saw what had happened instead: the hit squads that had tried to kill Zelensky; the murders of civilians in Bucha, a Kyiv suburb; the Ukrainian journalists who had driven around the country trying to tell the story; the civilians who had joined the army; the waitresses who had started cooking for the troops.\\n\\nThree years later, against all obstacles and all predictions, the civilians, journalists, soldiers, and waitresses are still working together. Ukraine’s million-man army, the largest in Europe, is still fighting. Ukraine’s civil society is still volunteering, still raising money for the troops. Ukraine’s defense industry has transformed itself. In 2022, I saw tiny workshops that made drones out of what looked like cardboard and glue. In 2024, Ukrainian factories produced 1.5 million drones, and this year they will make many more. Teams of people in underground control centers now use bespoke software to hit thousands of targets every month. Their work explains why Russia has taken territory only slowly, despite being on the offensive for most of the past year. At the current rate of advance, the Institute for the Study of War estimates, Russia would need 83 years to capture the remaining 80 percent of Ukraine.\\n\\nRussia doesn’t have the resources to fight indefinitely against that kind of organization and determination. Putin’s military production is cannibalizing his country’s civilian economy. Inflation has skyrocketed. The only way Putin wins now—the only way he finally succeeds in destroying Ukraine’s sovereignty—is by persuading Ukraine’s allies to be sick of the war.\\n\\nHe wins by persuading Trump to cut off Ukraine, because Zelensky has no cards, and by convincing Europeans that they can’t win either. That’s why Putin’s money bought American influencers in Tennessee and probably many other places, too, and it’s why his propaganda supported the pro-Russian far right in Germany’s elections yesterday, along with other pro-Russian parties across the continent. Putin can’t win on the ground, but he can win in his enemies’ heads—if we let him.\\n\\nRobert Kagan: Trump is facing a catastrophic defeat in Ukraine\\n\\nEuropeans and Americans, Democrats and Republicans, can resist the temptations of boredom and distraction. We can refuse to give in to the cynicism, nihilism, and lies of Russian propaganda, even when they are repeated by the president of the United States. And we can refuse to believe that Ukraine has no cards, that we have no cards, and that the democratic world has no sources of power other than Donald Trump and Elon Musk.\\n\\nThree years into this war, the stakes are the same as they were on the night it began. Putin, who yesterday launched one of the largest attacks of the entire war, still seeks to destroy Ukraine’s sovereignty, civil society, democracy, and freedom. He still wants to show the world that the era of American power is over, that America will not defend allies in Europe, Asia, or anywhere else. He still wants to nullify the rules and laws that kept Europe peaceful for eight decades, to create instability and fear, not only in the countries that border Russia but across the continent and even around the world.\\n\\nThe war will only end, truly end, when Putin gives up these goals. Don’t accept any peace deal that allows him to keep them.'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-24T10:00:00',\n",
       "   'content': 'Donald Trump has done Europe a favor. During a press conference last week, the president blamed Ukraine for triggering Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of its territory, and for having the temerity to continue fighting a Russian army bent on wiping out Ukrainian national identity. Trump had previously noted that Russia has lost a lot of soldiers in the invasion, as if that gives Moscow’s army a right of conquest over the parts of Ukraine that it seized. He paid no heed to the massive number of war crimes that Russia committed along the way.\\n\\nIn doing all this, Trump was disabusing European democracies of the illusion, widely held among such countries’ leaders, that the United States was a reliable defender of freedom on the continent and could be trusted in a crisis. In the days before his anti-Ukrainian rant, Trump’s defense secretary said that the U.S. will reduce its military footprint in Europe, his vice president promoted the cause of pro-Putin far-right parties in Europe, and his Ukraine envoy pushed a plan for elections on Ukraine that mirrored Kremlin thinking.\\n\\nIn short, Trump is with Putin far more than he is with Europe’s democracies.\\n\\nAnne Applebaum: The end of the postwar world\\n\\nPerhaps this realization will lead Europe to act in its own interests in a way that it so far has found impossible to do. Relying on the United States has infantilized European states, to the point that until now they seemed incapable of thinking, let alone acting, on their own behalf. Europe must immediately start looking out for itself, because it can no longer depend on Washington as a defense partner or even a good friend. Adapting to this new reality will require a level of effort that Europe has not shown for decades.\\n\\nThe first thing European states must do is replace U.S. military and economic support for Kyiv. Ukrainian victory, including the survival of Ukrainian democracy and the defense of Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders, is vital to the future security of Europe. But European states have meekly allowed the U.S. to steer the war in disastrous directions. First, President Joe Biden, despite supporting Ukraine’s defense, gave in to Russian nuclear threats and withheld potentially decisive Western weapons systems at crucial junctures. Now his successor has switched sides and taken Russia’s position.\\n\\nAlthough Europe as a whole has supplied more aid, the U.S. has provided far more than any single European country. That assistance has included a great deal of the world’s most powerful and effective military equipment. Europe cannot hope to replicate American strength in military technology. Europe itself is a consumer of the American-developed Patriot air-defense systems that Ukraine has been using. If the United States stops supplying 155-millimeter artillery shells, or the cannon barrels through which they are fired, Europe may not be able to provide anything close to the necessary quantities.\\n\\nBut although European states can’t just build lots of Patriot missiles and other essential American-made equipment, they can do more to provide what Ukraine needs to fight in the coming year. They can dig deeper into their own stocks; supply European weapons systems, such as German-made Taurus cruise missiles, that they have heretofore denied the Ukrainians; and even use seized Russian financial assets to purchase weapons from around the world. They can also speed up cooperation and financial support for Ukraine’s own unmanned-aerial-vehicle industry. This will both help Ukraine and significantly improve the UAV capacity of European states in the future. The Ukraine war is the greatest drone-technology laboratory that the world has yet seen.\\n\\nMore cooperation with Ukraine on drones should also help European countries develop their own military-production capabilities. Taken together, these democracies are among the world’s biggest spenders on military procurement. In 2024, EU states alone spent more than 320 billion euros on defense. However, this large sum was terribly spent. It yielded wild duplication of frontline weapons systems and relatively little investment in better logistics, maintenance, and supply replenishment. European governments should establish a common production system that adopts fewer designs for vehicles and equipment but produces many more of each model.\\n\\nPhillips Payson O’Brien: A wider war has already started in Europe\\n\\nFurthermore, Europeans will almost certainly have to arrange for their own nuclear weapons. Since World War II, the Western democracies have been under the U.S. nuclear shield. Without reliable American protection, all of democratic Europe would have to rely on the small British and French nuclear forces to deter a much larger Russian arsenal. A further problem is that the British and French forces are partly based on U.S.-supplied technology.\\n\\nTo protect against Russian nuclear blackmail without help from Washington, Europe would need a crash nuclear-weapons program and to develop a command structure that would reassure all of the continent’s democracies that they are protected by those weapons. This is no easy task. Europe has the technological capacity now to build nuclear warheads but would need to develop its own intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and other delivery systems. And it would have to do all of this quickly.\\n\\nTo take the necessary steps—bolstering Ukraine, building up European military production, and devising a nuclear deterrent separate from America’s—Europe will need to do one more thing: create a political structure to help guide this process. Both NATO and the EU would likely be hamstrung by pro-Putin fifth columnists in Hungary and Slovakia. Another problem for the EU is that it doesn’t include the United Kingdom, one of Europe’s major military powers.\\n\\nEurope should create its own strong military alliance, one that draws on the existing assets of NATO members, with the exception of the U.S., Hungary, and Slovakia. Turkey and Canada, too, could be invited to join the new European version of NATO. This organization would need teeth, including an entirely new military-command structure and the ability to help European states rationalize their weapons production. It would also have to be able to ruthlessly purge pro-Putin member states from its ranks in the future. It would use European resources to prepare to fight wars and protect European freedoms.\\n\\nWhat the past few years have shown is that European self-infantilization has probably hastened the continent’s decline relative to the rest of the world. While the U.S. has powered ahead in technology, Europe has lagged behind. A new, emboldened Europe, looking after itself and spending its own money to invest in high-tech defense industries, could also kick-start the continent’s revitalization.\\n\\nMoreover, it could provide the world with hope that democracy will not be extinguished. The United States now is on some strange, dark journey. The future of freedom in America is uncertain when the president lavishly praises dictators and fulminates against legitimately elected leaders. Europe can show the world that democratic states can, if pushed, still rally to protect themselves.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'In the months leading up to February 24, 2022, the day Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Joe Biden warned that such an action would trigger “the most severe sanctions that have ever been imposed”—a threat that many European leaders echoed.\\n\\nTo Daleep Singh, the White House’s top international economic adviser at the time, Biden’s threat could mean only one thing: freezing Russia’s central-bank reserves. The Central Bank of Russia held more than $630 billion in assets, making it the largest sanctions target in modern history. If any entity was too big to sanction, this was it. Maintaining the bank’s teeming coffers was Putin’s attempt to “sanctions-proof” his economy, ensuring that Russia could prop up the ruble and pay for imports even under financial attack. Yet about half of the bank’s reserves were in dollars, euros, and pounds, which in practice left them vulnerable to Western sanctions. At the stroke of a pen, U.S. and European leaders could order their banks to block the accounts of Russia’s central bank, rendering much of Putin’s cash pile inaccessible.\\n\\nThis essay has been adapted from Edward Fishman’s new book, Chokepoints: American Power in the Age of Economic Warfare.\\n\\n“Big nations don’t bluff”: This mantra, which Biden was fond of reciting, rang in Singh’s ears the day after Putin invaded Ukraine. Sanctions on the Central Bank of Russia, Singh believed, would put Biden’s credo into action. The option was so extreme that it had never received thorough vetting on either side of the Atlantic. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was concerned that freezing the central-bank reserves would push other countries away from using the dollar as their go-to reserve currency. The dollar’s global dominance allows America to absorb economic shocks, borrow cheaply, and run large deficits. Yellen was uncomfortable risking these privileges for the sake of punishing Putin.\\n\\nBut in Europe, a momentous political shift was under way, with street protests against the Russian invasion drawing out hundreds of thousands of people. Singh’s European counterparts assured him that if the White House was ready to sanction Russia’s central bank, their governments would follow. Yellen was hard to convince until a phone call from Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, her old colleague from his tenure as head of the European Central Bank, persuaded her to relent. Within hours, the United States was on board.\\n\\nJust two days after the invasion began, the members of the G7 issued a statement committing to target Russia’s central bank. “You heard about Fortress Russia—the war chest of $630 billion of foreign reserves,” Singh told reporters in a background briefing. “This will show that Russia’s supposed sanctions-proofing of its economy is a myth.”\\n\\nThree years on, the sanctions against Russia’s central bank stand as both a triumph and a warning. In narrow terms, they worked exactly as Singh hoped: They caught Putin off guard and deprived him of his deepest pool of hard currency. The frozen reserves, valued at nearly $300 billion, have also helped underwrite tens of billions in Western aid to Ukraine. As Donald Trump embarks on his much-anticipated peace negotiations, they will provide important leverage—Putin will be desperate to recover them, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will press to redirect them toward his country’s reconstruction.\\n\\nRead: The sanctions against Russia are starting to work\\n\\nBut the sanctions failed in one crucial way. The fact that Moscow was blindsided by them suggests it grossly underestimated the severity of the penalties it would face. Although the U.S. and its allies had developed an extensive menu of possible sanctions before the invasion, they never reached consensus on how far they were willing to go. They left Putin to divine the meaning of “the most severe sanctions that have ever been imposed,” and Putin—as he so often did—read Western ambiguity as weakness.\\n\\nIf Biden and other world leaders had committed ahead of time to the actions they would eventually take, they might have had a much better chance of staving off Putin’s invasion. Deterrence can’t work if your adversary underestimates your ability or willingness to act. Putin never saw the sanctions coming—and that was precisely the problem.\\n\\n“The acme of skill,” Sun Tzu wrote in The Art of War, is not “to win one hundred victories in one hundred battles,” but “to subdue the enemy without fighting.” Economic warfare has always offered nations a way to advance their interests without resorting to violence.\\n\\nFor most of history, imposing serious economic pressure required the deployment of military forces: ships blockading ports, armies laying siege to cities. As recently as the 1990s, the United Nations embargo on Iraq relied on warships patrolling the Persian Gulf. But over the past two decades, America has pioneered a more potent and nimble style of economic warfare. In a world where finance and supply chains are deeply globalized, Washington learned to leverage economic chokepoints—such as the U.S. dollar and advanced semiconductor technology—against rivals. Now, by merely signing documents in the Oval Office, the president can impose economic penalties far more severe than the blockades and embargoes of old.\\n\\nThis new age of economic warfare began innocuously enough: with Stuart Levey, a little-known lawyer who led a brand-new division of the Treasury Department from 2004 to 2011, trying to prove President George W. Bush wrong. Iran’s nuclear program was racing forward in the mid-2000s, and Bush lamented that America had “sanctioned ourselves out of influence” with the country. The only options, seemingly, were to go to war or let Iran join the ranks of nuclear-armed states. Levey set out to show there was another way.\\n\\nIn the years that followed, Levey and his colleagues overhauled U.S. sanctions policy. They drew on their legal expertise and their understanding of the financial sector’s risk calculus to conscript multinational banks into a campaign to isolate Iran from the world economy. Prodded by Congress, they tested the limits of their new economic weapons—they even found a way to freeze more than $100 billion of Iran’s oil money in overseas escrow accounts. Over time, this economic pressure helped spur political change in Iran and opened a path to the 2015 nuclear deal. The United States had managed to put Iran’s nuclear aspirations on hold—as Barack Obama boasted, “without firing a shot.”\\n\\nThe Iran deal had its critics, but one thing was beyond dispute—sanctions worked. In fact, the deal’s toughest opponents argued that America had traded them away too soon: The pressure was working so well that if the U.S. had just kept it up, the Iranian regime might have permanently relinquished its entire nuclear program or, better yet, collapsed. But a key reason the sanctions were so successful—winning grudging acceptance even from the likes of China, India, and Russia—was that Obama expressly deemed them a means to an end. They were intended to pressure Iran to concede to nuclear constraints and then be lifted. This is just how things played out.\\n\\nAs the Iran deal was being negotiated, Putin shocked the world by sending “little green men” into Crimea and swiftly annexing the territory. Determined to punish Russia for this flagrant imperial land grab, but unwilling to risk war with a fellow nuclear power, U.S. officials again reached into their economic arsenal. Russia was a trickier target than Iran: It was much bigger and more integral to the world economy. European countries depended on Russian oil and gas. If sanctions wreaked too much havoc on Russia, the fallout would quickly reach Europe and then the United States. As a result, the Obama administration stitched together a sanctions coalition with the European Union and the rest of the G7. This alliance imposed sanctions that, surgical though they were, quickly sent Russia’s economy spiraling. The collapse of world oil prices in the second half of 2014 supercharged their impact, and by early the following year, Putin was eager for a truce.\\n\\nUp until that point, the United States had used its economic arsenal wisely. But then it made a costly error. The unexpected severity of Russia’s economic crisis frightened European leaders, who feared it would spill over into their own countries. Instead of insisting that the West press its advantage, Obama endorsed a European-brokered cease-fire to freeze the Ukraine conflict and refrained from ratcheting up pressure—even after Russia violated the cease-fire and interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Putin drew a lesson from this experience: Western leaders lacked the stomach to sustain real economic pressure on Russia—and even if they proved him wrong, he could just wait them out.\\n\\nWatch: ‘War and cheese’\\n\\nThat assumption held up when Trump came to power. Far from strengthening sanctions on Russia, he allowed them to atrophy. Meanwhile, he ripped up the Iran deal and tried to bludgeon Tehran with “maximum pressure” sanctions, leading Iran to restart its nuclear program. Trump’s policies on Russia and Iran gravely undermined the strategic value of American sanctions. Putin had done little to concede to U.S. demands, yet he was rewarded with a reprieve. Iran, by contrast, had complied with a deal to dismantle core parts of its nuclear program—only for the U.S. to reimpose penalties two years later. World leaders drew another troubling lesson: Even if they did exactly what Washington asked of them, they might still face the brunt of America’s economic arsenal.\\n\\nU.S. sanctions policy grew more arbitrary under Trump. With the exception of Russia, he was as sanctions-happy a president as America has ever had. He levied so many sanctions—against Iran, Venezuela, China—that countries all over the world took steps to shield themselves. The Russian central bank traded most of its dollars for euros and gold. China sought new ways to promote its own currency internationally, releasing a digital version of the renminbi and creating a homegrown financial-messaging-and-settlement platform.\\n\\nU.S. officials often initiate sanctions campaigns in the heat of a crisis and scramble to react to unfolding events. The latest iteration of American economic warfare, following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, has been different: U.S. officials knew months ahead of time that Russia was gearing up to invade. They had the opportunity to use sanctions to deter Russian aggression rather than punish it after the fact. But following years of deploying economic weapons in an erratic and incoherent manner, the opportunity went to waste.\\n\\nAfter the central-bank freeze that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, subsequent sanctions were a disappointment. If Moscow didn’t foresee the one big sanction that might have deterred the invasion, it certainly did foresee the smaller ones that were coming—and had plenty of time and resources to prepare.\\n\\nRead: What makes Russia’s economy so sanctions-resistant?\\n\\nIn December 2022, months after the move against the central bank, the United States and its allies made their first serious attempt to target the lifeblood of Russia’s economy: oil sales. Under the new regulations, known as the “price cap,” U.S. and European firms could no longer ship, insure, or finance cargoes of Russian oil sold for any price above $60 a barrel.\\n\\nThe price cap was not as extreme as the central-bank freeze, but it packed a punch. A typical barrel of Russian oil was shipped aboard a European tanker whose insurance was British and whose cargo was paid for in U.S. dollars. The West had a near-monopoly on maritime insurance, in particular: Its insurers covered more than 95 percent of all oil cargoes. Now Western governments were exploiting this dominance to stem the flow of petrodollars to the Kremlin.\\n\\nBut as with the central-bank sanctions, America and its allies were too worried about economic blowback to act decisively. They took nearly 10 months after the start of the invasion to impose the price cap. As a result, Russia raked in a whopping $220 billion from oil exports in 2022, contributing to the highest single-year energy revenues the Kremlin has ever collected. Perversely, this was almost as much hard currency as the West had frozen when it sanctioned Russia’s central bank. To make matters worse, the West also built loopholes into the policy to avoid even the slightest possibility that it could cause an oil-supply crunch and exacerbate inflation. Russia took full advantage, amassing a “shadow fleet” of secondhand oil tankers and designing state-backed insurance schemes—and the impact of the price cap eroded. Today, with Trump back in the White House, the prospects of strengthening the policy look slim.\\n\\nThe United States uses sanctions a lot, and yet it has hardly perfected the art of economic warfare. Compared with the way the Pentagon prepares for conventional war—including recruiting and training professional troops, devising plans, and rehearsing them repeatedly—the U.S. agencies responsible for economic war are still playing in the minor leagues, using ad hoc processes and a rudimentary policy apparatus.\\n\\nSanctions are like antibiotics: They work well when used correctly but cause a host of problems when used excessively or inappropriately. For some purposes, they’re simply the wrong tool; sanctions didn’t change the regimes in Iran or Venezuela, despite the best efforts of the last Trump administration, nor could they be expected to.\\n\\nIn other cases, sanctions have the potential to work, but only if they’re administered in strong enough doses over a long enough period to avoid resistance. This is the problem the United States has faced in confronting Russia: Washington and its allies ratcheted up sanctions incrementally, giving Russia time to adapt and build resistance along the way. As a result, Biden failed to deliver a knockout blow to Russia’s economy—and Putin, yet again, seems confident he can get a reprieve, no matter what he does in Ukraine.\\n\\nThis article has been adapted from Edward Fishman’s new book, Chokepoints: American Power in the Age of Economic Warfare.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'UNITED NATIONS (AP) — In a win for Ukraine on the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion, the United States on Monday failed to get the U.N. General Assembly to approve its resolution urging an end to the war without mentioning Moscow’s aggression. And the assembly approved a dueling European-backed Ukrainian resolution demanding Russia immediately withdraw from Ukraine.\\n\\nREAD MORE: Western leaders visit Kyiv, pledge support against Russia on the war’s 3rd anniversary\\n\\nIt marks a setback for the Trump administration in the 193-member world body, whose resolutions are not legally binding but are seen as a barometer of world opinion. But it also shows some diminished support for Ukraine, whose resolution passed 93-18, with 65 abstentions. That’s lower than previous votes, which saw over 140 nations condemn Russia’s aggression.\\n\\nThe United States had tried to pressure the Ukrainians to withdraw their resolution in favor of its proposal, according to a U.S. official and a European diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private. They refused, and then the assembly added language to the U.S. proposal making clear that Russia invaded its smaller neighbor in violation of the U.N. Charter.\\n\\nThe vote on the amended U.S. resolution was 93-8 with 73 abstentions, with Ukraine voting “yes,” the U.S. abstaining and Russia voting “no.”\\n\\nUkrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Mariana Betsa said her country is exercising its “inherent right to self-defense” following Russia’s invasion, which violates the U.N. Charter’s requirement that countries respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other nations.\\n\\n“As we mark three years of this devastation — Russia’s full invasion against Ukraine — we call on all nations to stand firm and to take … the side of the Charter, the side of humanity and the side of just and lasting peace, peace through strength,” she said.\\n\\nREAD MORE: France and Britain’s leaders head to Washington to urge Trump not to abandon Ukraine\\n\\nU.S. deputy ambassador Dorothy Shea, meanwhile, said multiple previous U.N. resolutions condemning Russia and demanding the withdrawal of Russian troops “have failed to stop the war,” which “has now dragged on for far too long and at far too terrible a cost to the people in Ukraine and Russia and beyond.”\\n\\n“What we need is a resolution marking the commitment from all U.N. member states to bring a durable end to the war,” Shea said.\\n\\nThe dueling proposals reflect the tensions that have emerged between the U.S. and Ukraine after President Donald Trump suddenly opened negotiations with Russia in a bid to quickly resolve the conflict. It also underscores the strain in the transatlantic alliance with Europe over the Trump administration’s extraordinary turnaround on engagement with Moscow. European leaders were dismayed that they and Ukraine were left out of preliminary talks last week.\\n\\nIn escalating rhetoric, Trump has called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “dictator,” falsely accused Kyiv of starting the war and warned that he “better move fast” to negotiate an end to the conflict or risk not having a nation to lead. Zelenskyy responded by saying Trump was living in a Russian-made “disinformation space.”\\n\\nSince then, the Trump administration not only declined to endorse Ukraine’s U.N. resolution, but at the last minute proposed its own competing resolution and pressed its allies to support that version instead. It comes as Trump plans to host French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday in Washington.\\n\\nThe U.S. also wanted a vote on its proposal in the more powerful U.N. Security Council. China, which holds the council presidency this month, has scheduled it for Monday afternoon.\\n\\nREAD MORE: Merz prioritizes Ukraine, vows to tackle migration and economy after German election win\\n\\nThe General Assembly has become the most important U.N. body on Ukraine because the 15-member Security Council, which is charged with maintaining international peace and security, has been paralyzed by Russia’s veto power.\\n\\nThere are no vetoes in the assembly, and the Ukraine resolution, which is co-sponsored by all 27 members of the European Union, is almost certain to be adopted. Its votes are closely watched as a barometer of world opinion, but the resolutions passed there are not legally binding, unlike those adopted by the Security Council.\\n\\nSince Russia forces stormed across the border on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Assembly has approved half a dozen resolutions that have condemned Moscow’s invasion and demanded the immediate pullout of Russian troops.\\n\\nThe votes on the rival resolutions — which have sparked intense lobbying and arm-twisting, one European diplomat said — will be closely watched to see if that support has waned and to assess the backing for Trump’s effort to negotiate an end to the fighting.\\n\\nThe very brief U.S. draft resolution acknowledges “the tragic loss of life throughout the Russia-Ukraine conflict” and “implores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.” It never mentions Moscow’s invasion.\\n\\nRussia’s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, told reporters last week that the U.S. resolution was “a good move.”\\n\\nThe Ukraine’s resolution, meanwhile, refers to “the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation” and recalls the need to implement all previous assembly resolutions “adopted in response to the aggression against Ukraine.”\\n\\nIt singles out the assembly’s demand that Russia “immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.”\\n\\nIt stresses that any involvement of North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia’s forces “raises serious concerns regarding further escalation of this conflict.”\\n\\nThe resolution reaffirms the assembly’s commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and also “that no territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal.”\\n\\nIt calls for “a de-escalation, an early cessation of hostilities and a peaceful resolution of the war against Ukraine” and it reiterates “the urgent need to end the war this year.”\\n\\nAP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump welcomed French President Emmanuel Macron to the White House for talks on Monday at a moment of deep uncertainty about the future of transatlantic relations, with Trump transforming American foreign policy and effectively tuning out European leadership as he looks to quickly end Russia’s war in Ukraine.\\n\\nA joint news conference between Trump and Macron is scheduled to begin at 2 p.m. ET. Watch in the player above.\\n\\nThe two leaders started their day by participating in a virtual meeting with fellow leaders of the Group of Seven economies to discuss the war.\\n\\nTrump also has made demands for territory — Greenland, Canada, Gaza and the Panama Canal — as well as precious rare earth minerals from Ukraine. Just over a month into his second term, the “America First” president has cast an enormous shadow over what veteran U.S. diplomats and former government officials had regarded as America’s calming presence of global stability and continuity.\\n\\nDespite some notable hiccups, the military, economic and moral power of the United States has dominated the post-World War II era, most notably after the Cold War came to an end with the collapse of the Soviet Union. All of that, some fear, may be lost if Trump gets his way and the U.S. abandons the principles under which the United Nations and numerous other international bodies were founded.\\n\\n“The only conclusion you can draw is that 80 years of policy in standing up against aggressors has just been blown up without any sort of discussion or reflection,” said Ian Kelly, a U.S. ambassador to Georgia during the Obama and first Trump administration and now a professor at Northwestern University.\\n\\n“I’m discouraged for a lot of reasons, but one of the reasons is that I had taken some encouragement at the beginning from the repeated references to ‘peace through strength,'” Kelly added. “This is not peace through strength — this is peace through surrender.”\\n\\nVisits start on anniversary of war in Ukraine\\n\\nTrump, a Republican, is hosting Macron on Monday, the three-year anniversary of the war in Ukraine. Trump is set to hold a meeting Thursday with another key European leader, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\\n\\nTheir visits come after Trump shook Europe with repeated criticism of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for failing to negotiate an end to the war and rebuffing a push to sign off on a deal giving the U.S. access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, which could be used in the American aerospace, medical and tech industries.\\n\\nEuropean leaders also were dismayed by Trump’s decision to dispatch top aides for preliminary talks with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia without Ukrainian or European officials at the table.\\n\\nAnother clash is set to play out at the U.N. on Monday after the U.S. proposed a competing resolution that lacks the same demands as one from Ukraine and the European Union for Moscow’s forces to immediately withdraw from the country.\\n\\nOn the minerals deal, Zelenskyy initially bristled, saying it was short on security guarantees for Ukraine. He said Sunday on X that “we are making great progress” but noted that “we want a good economic deal that will be part of a true security guarantee system for Ukraine.”\\n\\nTrump administration officials say they expect to reach a deal this week that would tie the U.S. and Ukrainian economies closer together — the last thing that Russia wants.\\n\\nIt follows a public spat, with Trump calling Zelenskyy a “dictator” and falsely charging Kyiv with starting the war. Russia, in fact, invaded its smaller and lesser-equipped neighbor in February 2022.\\n\\nZelenskyy, who said Sunday in response to a question that he would trade his office for peace or to join NATO, then angered Trump by saying the U.S. president was living in a Russian-made “disinformation space.” Confronting Trump might not be the best approach, analysts say.\\n\\n“The response to President Trump doing something to you is not to do something back right away. You tend to get this kind of reaction,” said retired Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.\\n\\nHe added, “This is part of a broader issue where I know the administration’s characterizing themselves as disruptors. I think a better term might be destabilizers. And, unfortunately, the destabilizing is sometimes us and our allies.”\\n\\nThat complicated dynamic makes this week’s task all the more difficult for Macron and Starmer, leaders of two of America’s closest allies, as they try to navigate talks with Trump.\\n\\nHigh-stakes talks between European and US leaders\\n\\nMacron said he intended to tell Trump it’s in the joint interest of Americans and Europeans not to show weakness to Putin during U.S.-led negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. He also suggested he’ll make the case that how Trump handles Putin could have enormous ramifications for U.S. dealings with China, the United States’ most significant economic and military competitor.\\n\\n“You can’t be weak in the face of President Putin. It’s not you, it’s not your trademark, it’s not in your interest,” Macron said on social media. “How can you then be credible in the face of China if you’re weak in the face of Putin?'”\\n\\nYet, Trump has shown a considerable measure of respect for the Russian leader. Trump said this month he’d like to see Russia rejoin what is now the Group of Seven major economies. Russia was suspended from the G8 after Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region.\\n\\nTrump dismissed Zelenskyy’s complaints about Ukraine and Europe not being included in the opening of U.S.-Russia talks, suggesting he’s been negotiating “with no cards, and you get sick of it.”\\n\\nPutin, on the other hand, wants to make a deal, Trump argued Friday. “He doesn’t have to make a deal. Because if he wanted, he would get the whole country,” Trump added.\\n\\nThe deference to Putin has left some longtime diplomats worried.\\n\\n“The administration should consider going in a different direction because this isn’t going to work,” said Robert Wood, a retired career diplomat who served in multiple Republican and Democratic administrations. “Let’s not kid ourselves: Russia started this war, and trying to rewrite the narrative isn’t going to serve the best interests of the U.S. or our allies.”\\n\\nAP writer Chris Megerian contributed reporting.\"},\n",

       "   'content': 'KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Negotiations between U.S. and Ukrainian officials over continued American military aid in exchange for access to Ukraine’s valuable mineral resources are gaining traction after a rocky start, something Kyiv hopes will help secure long-term support for its defense against Russia.\\n\\nUkraine has offered to strike a deal with President Donald Trump which would supply the U.S. with rare earth elements — critical for various technologies. Trump said that he wanted such a deal earlier this month, and it was initially proposed last fall by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as part of his plan to strengthen Kyiv’s hand in future negotiations with Moscow.\\n\\nBut Kyiv balked at initial U.S. offers, arguing they didn’t contain adequate security assurances for Ukraine and that the proposed price tag of $500 billion would saddle generations of Ukrainians with debt.\\n\\nBut signs from both sides suggest the gap may be closing, and a deal could be on the horizon.\\n\\nHere is a look at Ukraine’s rare earth industry and how a deal might come together:\\n\\nWhat are rare earth elements?\\n\\nRare earth elements are a set of 17 elements that are essential to many kinds of consumer technology, including cellphones, hard drives and electric and hybrid vehicles.\\n\\nIt’s unclear if Trump is seeking specific elements in Ukraine, which also has other minerals to offer.\\n\\n“It can be lithium. It can be titanium, uranium, many others,” Yermak said. “It’s a lot.”\\n\\nChina, Trump’s chief geopolitical adversary, is the world’s largest producer of rare earth elements. Both the U.S and Europe have sought to reduce their dependence on Beijing.\\n\\nFor Ukraine, such a deal would ensure that its biggest and most consequential ally doesn’t freeze military support. That would be devastating for the country, which has been at war for nearly three years after Russia’s full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\\n\\nThe idea also comes at a time when reliable and uninterrupted access to critical minerals is increasingly hard to come by globally.\\n\\nWhat is the state of the Ukrainian minerals industry?\\n\\nUkraine’s rare earth elements are largely untapped because of the war and because of state policies regulating the mineral industry. The country also lacks good information to guide the development of rare earth mining.\\n\\nGeological data is thin because mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate. The industry’s true potential is clouded by insufficient research, according to businessmen and analysts.\\n\\nIn general, the outlook for Ukrainian natural resources is promising. The country’s reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe’s largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe’s largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass.\\n\\nREAD MORE:UN rejects U.S. resolution urging an end to the war in Ukraine without mentioning Moscow’s aggression\\n\\nIn 2021, the Ukrainian mineral industry accounted for 6.1% of the country’s gross domestic product and 30% of exports.\\n\\nAn estimated 40% of Ukraine’s metallic mineral resources are inaccessible because of Russian occupation, according to data from We Build Ukraine, a Kyiv-based think tank. Ukraine has argued that it’s in Trump’s interest to develop the remainder before Russian advances capture more.\\n\\nThe European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union, identified Ukraine as a potential supplier for more than 20 critical raw materials and concluded that if the country joins the 27-nation EU, it could strengthen the European economy.\\n\\nWhat happens next?\\n\\nNegotiations over a mineral deal between U.S. and Ukrainian officials have deepened in recent days as Kyiv has resisted initial proposals over their lack of specific assurances for Ukraine’s security.\\n\\nTrump administration officials have pressured Zelenskyy to accept a deal where Ukraine would divert $500 billion in profits from exploited minerals to Washington as compensation for its wartime support.\\n\\nBut Zelenskyy has rejected the offer, saying that while Kyiv welcomes partnering with the U.S. on minerals, he would not sign off on an agreement “that will be paid off by ten generations of Ukrainians.”\\n\\nIn a sign that negotiations on a deal were moving forward, Zelenskyy on Sunday told a forum in Kyiv marking the three-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion that the U.S.’ request for $500 billion had been taken “off the table.”\\n\\nTrump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” the same day that he expects a deal allowing the U.S. to play a greater role in exploiting Ukraine’s mineral resources to be reached this week.\\n\\nWhile U.S. companies have expressed interest in partnering with Ukraine on minerals, striking a formal deal will likely require new legislation, geological surveys and deeper negotiations on specific terms.\\n\\nIt’s unclear what kind of security guarantees companies would require to risk working in Ukraine, even in the event of a ceasefire. And no one knows for sure what kind of financing agreements would underpin contracts between Ukraine and U.S companies.\\n\\nSusie Blann and Associated Press writers Michelle L.

       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': 'Washington — The Supreme Court on Monday turned away two appeals from abortion rights opponents asking the justices to overrule a 25-year-old decision that allowed for buffer zones around abortion clinics, leaving that ruling in place.\\n\\nIn declining to wade into the court fight, the justices will not add a second abortion-related case to their current docket, following two terms in which the issue was before them. Last June, the court rebuffed two separate challenges involving abortion — the first over access to a popular pill used in medication abortions, and the second over how Idaho\\'s near-total ban on the procedure interacts with a federal emergency care law.\\n\\nIn June 2022, the court\\'s conservative majority overturned Roe v. Wade. Citing that landmark decision, anti-abortion rights groups had called on the Supreme Court to reverse its 2000 ruling in the case Hill v. Colorado, which involved buffer zones outside facilities to perform abortions.\\n\\nJustices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito said they would have granted the requests to hear the cases. In a dissent from the Supreme Court\\'s denial of the appeal in one of those disputes, involving an ordinance passed by the city council in Carbondale, Illinois, Thomas said the high court should make clear that its 2000 decision \"lacks continuing force\" and should be explicitly overturned.\\n\\nThe decision in Hill v. Colorado \"has been seriously undermined, if not completely eroded, and our refusal to provide clarity is an abdication of our judicial duty,\" he wrote.\\n\\nThe ordinance enacted in Carbondale came just six months after the Supreme Court\\'s conservative majority rolled back the constitutional right to abortion. Known as the \"Disorderly Conduct Ordinance,\" the restriction was put in place in response to the high court\\'s ruling, as reproductive health care clinics in the city reported an uptick of threats and acts of intimidation by people protesting abortion access.\\n\\nIllinois law protects the right to abortion, and Planned Parenthood opened a new facility in Carbondale in December 2023 as the state saw a spike in patients seeking abortion care from neighboring states that restricted abortion after Roe\\'s reversal. Two other clinics were also opened in the city, which is located in southern Illinois near the Missouri border.\\n\\nCarbondale\\'s measure created a 100-foot buffer zone around the entrance to health care facilities. Activists were prohibited from coming within eight feet of a person to give them a \"leaflet or handbill,\" display a sign or engage in \"oral protest, education or counseling\" inside the perimeter.\\n\\nThe ordinance took effect in January 2023 but was repealed several months later. The Carbondale City Council said it had not been enforced against any potential violator.\\n\\nBefore the measure was rolled back, the Missouri-based group Coalition Life challenged it, arguing it violates the First Amendment. Coalition Life organizes sidewalk counselors who seek to provide information and assistance to women approaching abortion clinics, including alternatives to terminating their pregnancies.\\n\\nThe group has said their goal is to speak to the patients one-on-one and they believe it\\'s necessary to get close to them \"so they can make eye-contact and speak from a normal conversational distance in a friendly and gentle manner.\" Carbondale\\'s ordinance, however, hindered their ability to do so.\\n\\nA federal district court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit agreed to dismiss the case, citing the Supreme Court\\'s 2000 decision in the case Hill v. Colorado. The decision upheld a state law that barred activists from coming closer than eight feet of a person entering an abortion clinic to engage in protest, counseling or education unless they obtained their permission.\\n\\nThe court has heard one other case involving buffer zones outside of abortion clinics since its ruling nearly 25 years ago. In 2014, the high court unanimously struck down a Massachusetts law that established a 35-foot buffer zone around medical facilities where abortions are performed. The law exempted four categories of people: those entering or exiting the facility; employees; law enforcement or other public workers; and people using the public sidewalk or right-of-way covered by the buffer zone to get to another destination.\\n\\nSince the Supreme Court\\'s ruling in 2000, its makeup has shifted significantly. Conservatives now hold a 6-3 majority, and only one of the justices who heard that case, Thomas, is still on the bench. He joined the late Justice Antonin Scalia and retired Justice Anthony Kennedy in dissent.'},\n",

The court split 6-3 in the Hill case, with Thomas (one of the Hill dissenters) being the only one still on the high court today.\\n\\nWhile Alito simply noted without explanation that he would have granted review of the issue, Thomas laid out his latest disagreement in an eight-page dissent on Monday, noting that the Dobbs majority (which included him and Alito) said the Hill case had “distorted” the court’s First Amendment doctrines. Thomas wrote: “Following our repudiation in Dobbs, I do not see what is left of Hill. Yet, lower courts continue to feel bound by it. The Court today declines an invitation to set the record straight on Hill’s defunct status. I respectfully dissent.”\\n\\nIn line with the court’s typical practice, the majority did not explain on Monday why it declined to review the appeals challenging Hill. The denial came on the court’s routine order list, where the justices take action in pending appeals consisting mostly of rejecting petitions. The court only grants review in a relative handful of the thousands of petitions it receives annually. It takes four justices to grant review, and it would not have been surprising had the court done so here, given the current majority’s view on both abortion and speech-related issues.\\n\\nThomas’ written dissent came in one of the rejected appeals from an anti-abortion group called Coalition Life. The group challenged an ordinance in Carbondale, Illinois, that it said was virtually identical to the one that the court upheld in Hill, which set the zone within 100 feet outside a facility and within 8 feet of a person. “The lower courts had no choice but to uphold that carbon-copy measure. This Court has a better option,” the group said in the petition filed by lead counsel Paul Clement, a top conservative lawyer (who, coincidentally, was just appointed to weigh in on the propriety of the Trump Justice Department’s bid to dismiss criminal charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams).\\n\\nRepresented by Neal Katyal, another top high court lawyer, Carbondale opposed the petition, telling the justices that the city had since repealed the ordinance at issue without ever having enforced it. The Illinois city argued in its opposition brief that “no case or controversy exists” for the court to review, further contending that Hill had been correctly decided in any event.\\n\\nA separate petition seeking to overturn Hill in a New Jersey case came from the American Center for Law and Justice, whose chief counsel is Trump impeachment lawyer Jay Sekulow, who argued Hill for the challengers. Thomas and Alito likewise noted their disagreement with the court’s refusal to take up the New Jersey case, Turco v. City of Englewood.\\n\\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in Donald Trump’s legal cases.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday declined to consider overturning a 25-year-old precedent that upheld \"buffer zone\" laws limiting how close protesters can get to abortion clinic entrances.\\n\\nIn a setback for abortion opponents, the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority hostile to abortion rights, opted against weighing whether such laws violate the free speech rights of protesters under the Constitution\\'s First Amendment.\\n\\nAt issue in the two related cases were buffer zone laws in Carbondale, Illinois, and Englewood, New Jersey.\\n\\nIn the 2000 ruling in a case called Hill v. Colorado, the court upheld a buffer zone law in that state. A wave of such measures were enacted following violence connected to anti-abortion protesters, including a 1994 case in which two clinic workers were killed in Massachusetts.\\n\\nTwo conservative justices, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, said they would have taken up the Illinois case.\\n\\nThomas wrote a statement noting that the court has not applied the Hill ruling in recent years, but lower courts still \"feel bound by it.\"\\n\\nBy declining to take up the issue, the court \"declines an invitation to set the record straight,\" he added.\\n\\nThe last case on the issue was decided by the court in 2014, when it struck down a Massachusetts law, concluding that it was overly broad. The court then decided against overturning the 2000 precedent.\\n\\nThe court in 2022 subsequently overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide and energized the anti-abortion movement.\\n\\nAs a result of that ruling, protesters have increasingly targeted clinics in liberal-leaning states close to conservative states where abortion has been banned or severely restricted. Carbondale is one of those places, with three abortion clinics opening there since Roe was overturned.\\n\\nLawyers seeking to overturn the 2000 ruling say it is an outlier in free speech jurisprudence by, among other things, restricting speech on a divisive cultural issue and by finding that people have an interest in avoiding speech in which they do not wish to participate.\\n\\nThey also argue that the high court\\'s decision to overturn Roe further undermines any justification for the buffer zones.\\n\\nThe Carbondale ordinance was passed in 2023 in the aftermath of the Supreme Court\\'s abortion ruling, with city officials saying there had been an increase in protests outside clinics, some of which involved threats and intimidation. The measure stated that protesters cannot come within eight feet of another person inside a 100-foot perimeter of a health care facility\\'s entrance.\\n\\nIt was challenged by Coalition Life, an anti-abortion group, which its lawyers say engages in peaceful counseling outside clinics. A federal judge and the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals both ruled against the challengers, saying they were bound by the 2000 Supreme Court ruling.\\n\\nCarbondale swiftly repealed its measure once it became clear that Coalition Life was appealing to the Supreme Court. The group insists that the case has not become moot as the city\\'s lawyers argue in court papers.\\n\\nThe Englewood law, enacted in 2014, was challenged by Jeryl Turco, an anti-abortion protester. It bars anyone from standing within 8 feet of the entrance of a health care facility even if they are on a public sidewalk except for passersby, employees and patients. The measure was enacted in response to disturbances outside the Metropolitan Medical Associates clinic prompted by a protest group called Bread of Life Fellowship.\\n\\nThe ordinance \"had its desired effect,\" lawyers for the city said in court papers, with the situation outside the clinic calmer and people able to come and go without facing any \"physical harassment.\"\\n\\nLawyers for Turco at the American Center for Law and Justice, a conservative legal group, say she is not associated with Bread of Life and has long sought to peacefully counsel women not to have abortions while standing outside the clinic. She has also sought to give women printed materials.\\n\\nTurco initially won in federal district court but the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for the city on appeal.\\n\\nThe buffer zone dispute is the latest in a series of abortion-related cases that have reached the justices since Roe was overturned. Earlier this year, the court rejected an attempt to restrict access to the abortion pill mifepristone and sidestepped a ruling on whether a strict abortion ban in Idaho conflicts with federal law.'},\n",

It took a look at infant mortality nationwide after Roe V.

That is likely due to more frail fetuses being carried to term amid abortion restrictions, the study suggested.\\n\\n“I’m not sure that people expected infant mortality rates to increase following Dobbs. It’s not necessarily what people were thinking about,” Gallo told Ohio State News. “But when you restrict access to health care it can cause a broader impact on public health than can be foreseen.”\\n\\nSingh agreed, telling CNN that the research “is evidence of a national ripple effect, regardless of state-level status.”\\n\\n“This is the tip of the iceberg,” she said. “Mortality is the ultimate outcome of any health condition. This is a very, very acute indicator. It could be representative of underlying morbidity and underlying hardship.”\\n\\nSingh told the first outlet that she now wants to explore maternal and infant mortality rates among various populations.\\n\\n“There’s a broader human toll to consider,” she said, “including mental health consequences of being denied abortion care or being forced to carry a fetus with a fatal genetic abnormality to term.”'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Former President Donald Trump has suffered through plenty of painful courtroom defeats during his lengthy career as one of America’s most litigious businessmen.\\n\\nThis time looks different. He’s now officially overdue to receive a downright brutal judicial ruling in a case that threatens to dismember his business empire, drain his cash reserves and drive him out of New York State as a businessman forever.\\n\\nVideos by VICE\\n\\nManhattan Supreme Court Justice Aurthur Engoron blew through a self-imposed soft end-of-the-month deadline on Wednesday to deliver a judgment in the sweeping multi-million fraud lawsuit brought by the New York Attorney General Letitia James. Trump and his company have already been found liable, and are now just waiting to find out the size of the punishment. That decision could land at any moment, zapping Trump’s business like a thunderbolt when it does, in what could easily be the largest financial penalty of Trump’s life.\\n\\nThe New York Attorney General’s Office is seeking $370 million, along with a lifetime ban on Trump working in New York real estate or serving as an executive or director of a company based in the state. Judge Engoron declared Trump and his business liable for fraudulently overstating Trump’s wealth for financial gain in September. Now, the same judge bears sole responsibility for setting the penalty. A spokesperson for the court said Thursday that the ruling has been delayed until early to mid-February.\\n\\nA $370 million fine would follow Trump’s $83 million defamation loss to writer E. Jean Carroll, in a lawsuit over Trump’s derisive denials of Carroll’s claim that Trump raped her in a New York department store bathroom in the 1990s.\\n\\nSuch mammoth judgements dwarf notable courtroom defeats Trump has faced in the past.\\n\\nTrump’s company was fined only $1.6 million when it was found criminally liable in late 2022 for paying executives in off-the-books perks in what prosecutors branded an illegal scheme to minimize taxes.\\n\\nWhen Trump settled three lawsuits brought against his Trump University real estate training program in November 2016, right after he was elected president, he paid out a total of $25 million. In that instance, the NY Attorney General’s office had accused the operation of fraud, saying the unaccredited, for-profit venture misled its customers by calling the business a “university.”\\n\\nThe New York AG also had a hand in shutting down the Donald J. Trump Foundation, the personal charity Trump founded in 1987, through a lawsuit that forced the operation to dissolve in 2018. The office accused the charity of engaging in “persistently illegal conduct,” and said Trump used the foundation for his personal and political benefit. Yet when the foundation was shuttered, it was only forced to pay out less than $4 million to eight different charities.\\n\\nThis time, the stakes are much higher.\\n\\nThe potential combined $450 million in damages from both the New York fraud lawsuit and the Carroll case would equal roughly 15 percent of Trump’s $3.1 billion fortune, as estimated by Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\\n\\nTrump himself has boasted that his net worth amounts to some $10 billion or more, but independent experts generally assess his real fortune to be only a fraction of that amount, although still likely in the billions.\\n\\nTrump claimed last year that his cash stockpiles are “substantially in excess” of $400 million. He may in fact have $600 million in cash, according to Bloomberg estimates.\\n\\nTrump’s company is notoriously opaque, meaning that it’s hard to know exactly how much damage losing $450 million would inflict. Most of Trump’s known wealth is held in the form of real estate, including Trump Tower and residential and commercial buildings in Manhattan; golf courses around the country; the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida; and his Seven Springs estate in Westchester County, NY.\\n\\nTrump has often boasted about the amount of cash he keeps lying around.\\n\\n“We have a lot of cash,” Trump said in a deposition with New York attorney general’s office lawyers in April 2023. “I believe we have substantially in excess of $400 million in cash, which is a lot for a developer. Developers usually don’t have cash. They have assets, not cash. We have, I believe, $400-plus [million] and going up very substantially every month.”\\n\\nTrump won’t have to pay the full amount for either penalty immediately, and hopes to appeal both losses. But the amount will grow while he appeals, rising by 9 percent annually, according to The Wall Street Journal.\\n\\nTrump spent approximately $50 million in donor money on legal bills and investigation-related expenses in 2023, The New York Times reported on Wednesday. All told, Trump’s various legal committees spent roughly $210 million in 2023, while raising only $200 million, according to Politico. In other words, Trump’s legal fees are draining resources from his political operation, which spent more last year than it took in despite Trump’s incessant fundraising.\\n\\nThen there’s the question of whether, once this case and its appeals are all wrapped up, Trump’s family business will even be allowed to continue to exist in its current state.\\n\\nIn September, Judge Engoron caused a stir when, upon finding that Trump had committed fraud, he ordered the revocation of many state certificates Trump needs to run his companies. The judge said that the companies, which hold many of Trump’s assets including Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, should be turned over to a receiver for “dissolution.”\\n\\nWhen asked whether he meant that Trump’s buildings should be sold off, Judge Engoron demurred, saying he’d clarify his precise meaning later. That September order is now under appeal.\\n\\nYet so far Trump has lodged several other appeals related to the fraud case, including an attempt to remove James from the case, dismiss the suit completely and block multiple subpoenas.\\n\\nAlmost all of those efforts have failed.'},\n",

But to label bald jokes a form of sexual harassment? Seems a bit extreme.\\n\\nVideos by VICE\\n\\nApparently, the High Court thinks otherwise.\\n\\nThis whole lengthy case started back in 2019 when an electrician named Tony Finn accused his boss of sexual harassment.

In other words, “bald” is a sexist insult.\\n\\nThe three-person panel also stated that the remark “crossed a line” and there is “a connection between the word ‘bald’ and the protected characteristic of sex.”\\n\\nAccording to The Telegraph, the panel consisted of three bald men.\\n\\n“[Baldness] is much more prevalent in men than women,” they said. (K, well, tell that to the PCOS community.)\\n\\nNow, according to The Sun, the full judgment made at the Employment Appeals Tribunal has finally been published—four years after the initial comments against Finn. The electrician will likely receive compensation for the alleged sexual harassment.\\n\\nAs expected, this case is gaining major traction on social media, with many users expressing their disbelief over the ruling.\\n\\n“This is silly,” one person wrote. “We should all strive to be better people and to be more understanding and supportive with those who are missing something. But it seems silly to waste the court’s time with things so small.”\\n\\nMost others labeled the notion as nonsense.\\n\\nHowever, one person posed a different perspective: “I think it’s a bit extreme, but I can see the precedent.

Chuang\\'s order does not block the administration\\'s policy nationwide, and only applies to houses of worship owned or used by the challengers — the Quakers, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship and the Sikh Temple.\\n\\nThe groups had argued that the new policy allowing immigration arrests at places that were previously considered protected violates their First Amendment rights and burdens the free exercise of religion under federal law.\\n\\nChuang, appointed by President Barack Obama, found that the threat of enforcement action at houses of worship attended by the three religious communities has caused reductions in attendance by not only immigrants who are in the country illegally, but also by those with legal status who fear they may be mistaken for unauthorized immigrants. The court concluded that the new policy from the Trump administration likely violates the faith groups\\' rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the First Amendment.\\n\\n\"Where plaintiffs\\' communal religious exercise will be significantly and adversely affected by reductions in attendance resulting from immigration enforcement actions pursuant to the 2025 policy, armed law enforcement officers operating in or at places of worship pursuant to the 2025 policy will adversely affect the ability of Quakers and Sikhs to follow their religious beliefs or worship freely,\" Chuang wrote in a 59-page opinion.\\n\\nThe court found that the 2025 policy imposes a substantial burden on the groups\\' exercise of religion in relation to their communal worship and the Cooperative Baptists\\' immigrant-focused services.\\n\\n\"Immigration enforcement actions at plaintiffs\\' places of worship pursuant to the 2025 policy would impose substantial pressure on plaintiffs\\' to modify their behavior by preventing them from worshipping with a larger and more diverse group of congregants and thereby inhibiting their exercise of central facets of their respective religions,\" Chuang wrote.\\n\\nHe said that because the new directive from the Trump administration has already caused a decline in attendance at communal worship, it \"effectively compels\" the religious groups to worship with a smaller congregation and with fewer immigrants, \"even though their beliefs call for worship with as large and diverse a community as possible.\"\\n\\n\"Plaintiffs have thus shown that religious exercise is being hindered by the 2025 policy for entire congregations, including United States citizens and immigrants with legal status, whose ability to worship is undermined by such reduced participation,\" Chuang wrote.\\n\\nThe judge ordered the Trump administration to reinstate a 2021 memorandum from then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas that barred the department and its components from taking enforcement action in certain places that \"require special protection,\" including schools, medical facilities or places of worship. That memo said immigration enforcement action should not be undertaken at houses of worship \"to the fullest extent possible.\"\\n\\nThe court\\'s order requires the Department of Homeland Security under Mr. Trump to abide by the terms of the 2021 memo when pursuing enforcement actions at the three faith communities\\' places of worship.\\n\\nChuang\\'s order does not prevent the Trump administration from conducting arrests in or near places of worship when authorized by a warrant.\\n\\nMr. Trump\\'s directive revoking the Biden administration\\'s memo was issued on his first day in office as part of a series of executive actions aimed at cracking down on immigration. The Trump administration replaced it with a directive stating that \"it is not necessary\" to \"create bright line rules regarding where our immigration laws are permitted to be enforced.\"\\n\\nA press release from the Department of Homeland Security further stated that \"criminals will no longer be able to hide in America\\'s schools and churches to avoid arrest. The Trump administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense.\"\\n\\nThe Quakers are comprised of six different meetings of the Religious Society of Friends. The Religious Society of Friends has practiced the Quaker faith in the U.S. since the 1600s, and \"yearly meetings\" are its highest organizational bodies. The group has argued that the communal aspect of its worship is key to the exercise of the Quaker faith.\\n\\nThe Cooperative Baptist Fellowship is a network of churches, worshippers and partners that includes more than 1,400 congregations. Its congregations operate in 37 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Many congregations have a large number of immigrants as members, according to court filings, and some of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship\\'s congregations are engaged in ministry focused on immigrants and refugees.\\n\\nThe Sikh Temple is a place of worship for the Sikh population near Sacramento, California, which is made up of roughly 30,000 people. Roughly half of its congregation consist of immigrants, according to court papers.'},\n",

It weighed just over 215 pounds (98 kilograms) and was insured for 4.8 million pounds ($6 million). The value of the gold at the time was 2.8 million ($3.5 million).\\n\\nThe piece had previously been on display at The Guggenheim Museum in New York. The museum had offered the work to U.S. President Donald Trump during his first term in office after he had asked to borrow a Van Gogh painting.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOne of the defendants, Michael Jones, cased the palace twice in the weeks leading up to the theft — once before the toilet went on display at Blenheim Palace and up close and personal once it was installed and fully functional as an exhibit, Christopher said. Visitors to the exhibition could book a three-minute appointment to use the toilet.\\n\\nBoth times, Jones took photos of the window that was later smashed to break into the palace. The second time he also took photos from inside the bathroom, including a photo of the lock on the toilet door.\\n\\n“There can be no doubt that he was carrying out reconnaissance for the burglary that was to take place that night,” Christopher said. “That would be enough to make him guilty of count one of burglary.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBut Jones was also probably among the group of five men who crashed through the wooden gates of the palace before dawn the next morning in two stolen vehicles, Christopher said. They tore across a field in an Isuzu truck and VW Golf and pulled up to the front steps, where they smashed the window Jones had photographed.\\n\\nThey made quick work of breaking down the toilet door and removed the golden throne from the plumbing, leaving water gushing from the pipes that caused considerable damage to the 18th-century building, a UNESCO World Heritage site filled with valuable art and furniture that draws thousands of visitors each year.\\n\\nJones was in cahoots with James Sheen, a builder he worked for who was part of both the burglary and the effort to sell the gold, Christopher said. Sheen, 40, previously pleaded guilty to burglary, conspiracy and transferring criminal property.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSheen then worked to broker a deal with Fred Doe and Bora Guccuk to cash in on the haul. In a series of text messages, he referred to the loot as a “car,” but Christopher said he was actually talking about the gold.\\n\\n“I’ll link up with ya, I got something right up your path,” Sheen told Doe in one message.\\n\\n“I can sell that car for you in two seconds ... so come and see me tomorrow,” Doe said in a reply.\\n\\nDoe, 36, and Guccuk, 41, are charged with one count of conspiracy to transfer criminal property.'},\n",

From doubling our Advanced Manufacturing Fund, to building advanced technology in Texas, we’re thrilled to expand our support for American manufacturing. And we’ll keep working with people and companies across this country to help write an extraordinary new chapter in the history of American innovation. After meeting with Donald Trump last week, Cook’s moves appear to be intended to dodge the impact of Trump’s tariffs on goods imported from China. “They’re going to build here instead because they don’t want to pay the tariffs,” Trump said in a speech on Friday.

There’s a lot of news to come, so stick with this blog and our Ukraine/Europe blog and we’ll bring you all the developments as they happen. Here’s where things stand in Washington so far: The Trump administration said it was placing all but a handful of USAid personnel around the world on paid administrative leave and eliminating about 2,000 of those positions in the US, as the rapid dismantling of the organization appears to move into its final phases.\\n\\nAttorneys for federal workers said in a lawsuit that billionaire adviser to Donald Trump , Elon Musk, had violated the law with his weekend demand that employees explain their accomplishments or risk being fired. An updated lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in California and was provided to the Associated Press, is trying to block mass layoffs.\\n\\nUkraine and the US are working productively on an economic deal at the centre of an effort to end Russia’s war on Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Follow this and all related news, on the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, live, here . That blog, and the Guardian’s Washington bureau chief, David Smith, will cover the visit to the White House by French president Emmanuel Macron this afternoon.\\n\\nMany federal government departments are telling staff not to comply with the Musk directive to list their accomplishments in the past week by 11.59 pm ET tonight. But the US Transportation Department has told workers they should respond to the demand by Donald Trump’s adviser.\\n\\nA federal judge has blocked the government downsizing team Doge from accessing sensitive data maintained by the US Education Department and the US Office of Personnel Management. US district judge Deborah Boardman in Greenbelt, Maryland issued the temporary restraining order at the behest of a coalition of labor unions.\\n\\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration laid off 4% of its staff as part of the government-wide slashing of probationary employees’ jobs. Coincidentally, the agency has pending investigations into deadly crashes involving Tesla cars, the electric vehicle maker owned by Musk.\\n\\nAs the work of the very busy judiciary continues, in its constitutional role as a co-equal power base and check on the executive branch, a federal judge is set to consider this afternoon a request by the Associated Press (AP) to restore full access for the news agency’s journalists after the Trump administration barred them from certain governmental access for continuing to refer to the Gulf of Mexico in coverage. National media and hundreds of local media outlets rely on the AP.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has blocked a crucial step in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) process for funding medical research, likely in violation of a federal judge’s temporary restraining order on federal funding freezes.\\n\\nElon Musk’s email demanding all 2.3 million government workers justify their work has caused confusion, with several administration officials telling workers not to reply to the missive. On Saturday the tech billionaire sent an email titled: “What did you do last week?” requesting a bullet-point summary of what they had achieved in their working week.

       "   'content': 'One of the first places Gordon Cordeiro visited when a judge ordered him released after spending 30 years in prison for a killing he always maintained he had nothing to do with was his mother’s Hawaii gravesite.\\n\\nIn a videoconference interview on Saturday with the Associated Press, Cordeiro reflected on his first day of freedom after new DNA evidence led to the overturning of his conviction in the 1994 shooting of Timothy Blaisdell on the island of Maui.\\n\\nPaulette Cordeiro died in September 1994, and her son was arrested the following month.\\n\\n“Thanks for looking over me,” the son recalled saying at her grave, hours after walking out of the Maui community correctional center. “Keeping me safe”.\\n\\nA photo provided by his sister showed Cordeiro kneeling at their mother’s grave, with a lei he was given upon release draped over the headstone. Inscribed on it were the words: “You were the wind beneath our wings.”\\n\\nCordeiro said he thought constantly about his mother – who died at age 49 from ALS, often called Lou Gehrig’s disease – during his years behind bars. He and his sisters had taken turns caring for her, and he said he was with her and building shelving units for the family when Blaisdell was fatally shot during a drug deal robbery.\\n\\nAfter a steak dinner and the gravesite visit, he celebrated with family at his father’s house and then found himself unable to sleep much. The following day he went to other relatives’ graves and planned to go to Costco, he said.\\n\\n“It feels normal,” he said.\\n\\nBut the Maui he once knew has changed a lot, Cordeiro said, noting that the historic town of Lahaina was destroyed by a wildfire in 2023.\\n\\nAnother thing that has taken some getting used to: “Everybody is looking at their phones.”\\n\\nCordeiro had just a pager before he went to prison, he said. He now has a smartphone, but “I’m not staring at it yet. It keeps beeping and messages coming in, and it’s different,” he said.\\n\\nThere were gasps and cries in the courtroom on Friday when Judge Kirstin Hamman announced that his sentence was vacated and he was to be released from custody. She ruled that new evidence, including DNA test results, would probably change the outcome of another trial.\\n\\nThe Maui county prosecuting attorney Andrew Martin says he plans to appeal and seek to have bail imposed on Cordeiro’s release.\\n\\nCordeiro’s first trial ended in a hung jury, with only one juror voting to convict him. But he was later found guilty of murder, robbery and attempted murder and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.\\n\\nAfter Cordeiro’s conviction, new testing on physical evidence from the scene excluded him as the source of DNA on Blaisdell’s body and other crime scene evidence, the Hawaii Innocence Project said, and a DNA profile of an unidentified person was found on the inside pockets of Blaisdell’s jeans.\\n\\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines US Free newsletter Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The two met in prison at one point, according to Cordeiro.\\n\\n“We followed each other’s cases as we were going along,” he said. “We were both living in the same prison, so we both kept up with each other as the process was going.”\\n\\nFor now, Cordeiro said, his immediate plans include fixing cars, helping with his dad’s house and “maybe giving back to the community a little bit”.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"Katie Drummond: And ironically, as you mentioned earlier, that's part of what makes these lawsuits so challenging to see through because a judge is assessing risk based on hypothetical harms to American citizens as opposed to actual harm or actual injury. Is that right?\\n\\nAndrew Couts: I mean it depends on exactly what the lawsuit is alleging or what it's attempting to achieve, what kind of legal standards they're going to apply. But typically judges, if they're looking for actual or potential imminent harm, they're going to be looking at past precedent to say, is it likely that this worst case scenario that is laid out in a hypothetical lawsuit is going to happen? And if they can't find any evidence that has happened in the past, it's entirely plausible that the judge isn't going to rule in favor of the plaintiffs. We can't necessarily rely on history to tell us what's going to happen next, at least not US history. We can look to dictatorships elsewhere in the world potentially, but US history is not going to give us all the information we need to make those calls.\\n\\nKatie Drummond: That's right. And we're also still up against this very real possibility, I would argue that a judge rules in one way and that ruling may not actually be adhered to within a federal agency. We've certainly seen a degree of lawlessness and impunity with DOGE's behavior thus far. So I think that sort of adds this extra element of uncertainty where I have been telling people for the last several weeks who are concerned about DOGE, concerned about what Musk is doing. Well, yes, they're moving very quickly. The courts will catch up, the legal system will catch up. That only gets you so far if the administration decides not to adhere to what a judge is saying on a given issue.\\n\\nAndrew Couts: Absolutely, and I think the fact that we're even talking about that possibility of the government just ignoring judicial branch rulings, that is an example of how little we can rely on past precedent to show us where the guardrails are here. The guardrails may not exist anymore because they've plowed over them with a cyber truck. It's not a good situation to be in when you're trying to figure out how to operate in this moment and feel safe and secure that your data is protected or you're not going to be targeted for political reasons.\\n\\nKatie Drummond: Absolutely. Well, Andrew, there's so much uncertainty right now. In the next few weeks, what would you tell our listeners to pay attention to in the context of DOGE and privacy? Are there certain lawsuits that are particularly salient or particularly interesting? What should they be watching for in the headlines as all of this unfolds?\\n\\nAndrew Couts: Well, one, I think we're going to be looking for other instances where we know that specific records have been accessed or we know specifically how they've used the records that they've accessed. WIRED is certainly going to be keeping a close watch on that and doing the reporting to find answers to those questions. But the more we know about what they're actually doing or what the consequences of what they're doing are, the more we're going to be able to assess what the actual risks are. In terms of the lawsuits, I would be paying attention to essentially all of the Privacy Act lawsuits and seeing where those succeed and fail. And those are going to give us specific instances of potentially blocking access to specific records. So the Treasury Department is a good example of one we've already seen, and we're going to want to be getting reassurances that that access actually has been cut off in the instances where there's orders telling them to do so. Because the Privacy Act is really our primary legal blockade against these kinds of abuses that are being alleged in these lawsuits, we really need to know how strong that law actually is. We're also going to be wanting to see whether there are members of Congress attempting to amend change, scrap the Privacy Act, or any other legislation that might be the basis for lawsuits against what the Trump administration is doing. And so paying attention to legislation that's introduced, how that legislation proceeds through Congress is going to be really important as well, because we have to know what the safeguards are, whether they're abided by or not, they have to exist in the first place for us to have any sense of reliance on them.\"},\n",

He received a JD from Duke University and is the author of two books on the Supreme Court.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear its first employment discrimination case since President Donald Trump took power and began a fairly comprehensive assault on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in government and private employment.\\n\\nThe case, known as Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services, reads like it was generated for the very purpose of fueling opposition to DEI, and could be the end of a strange rule meant to discourage meritless discrimination lawsuits by groups not traditionally discriminated against.\\n\\nSCOTUS, Explained Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\\n\\nThat legally dubious, and often impractical, rule used in a handful of federal appeals courts is known as the “background circumstances rule.” It often requires members of a “majority” group to introduce evidence that is not demanded of “minority” plaintiffs. It is highly likely that the Court will say that these appeals courts must abandon this rule. Indeed, the appeals courts’ approach rests on such shaky legal ground that it’s possible that the Supreme Court’s decision will be unanimous.\\n\\nAdditionally, Ames is the first Supreme Court case alleging employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation since a majority of the justices held that discrimination on this basis is illegal in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020). Though two Republican justices, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined the Court’s decision in Bostock (Gorsuch even authored it), the Court appeared to back away from Bostock in an odd case involving Biden-era education regulations that the Court handed down last year.\\n\\nNone of the parties ask the Court to overrule or even narrow Bostock, but Ames could nonetheless give the justices a chance to clarify whether they stand by that decision.\\n\\nSignificantly, Marlean Ames, the plaintiff in Ames, is a straight woman. According to her brief, she was denied a promotion that later went to a lesbian. She also alleges she was later demoted, despite a record of favorable performance reviews, and replaced by a gay man. The crux of her employment discrimination claim is that both of these actions were taken because she is heterosexual.\\n\\nThe lower courts that heard her case, however, ruled against her before determining if this claim has merit, arguing that Ames failed to meet the standard of evidence required by the “background circumstances” rule.\\n\\nThe core question facing the justices is whether courts can effectively require members of a “majority group” to provide evidence that is not required of minority plaintiffs. Under both federal law and the Supreme Court’s precedents, the answer to this question is almost certainly “no.”\\n\\nStill, while it is hard to imagine the justices upholding the Sixth Circuit’s “background circumstances” rule, and a decision striking down that rule would hardly upend federal employment discrimination law, the case is worth watching because it potentially gives the Court’s Republican majority a vehicle to lash out more broadly at DEI programs. What is unsure is whether the justices will seize the opportunity this case presents.\\n\\nThe federal law banning employment discrimination applies equally to majority and minority plaintiffs\\n\\nThe “background circumstances” rule at the heart of Ames was first invented by the DC Circuit in 1981. Though that opinion acknowledged that “whites are also a protected group under Title VII,” the federal law governing many forms of employment discrimination, it reasoned that “it defies common sense to suggest that the promotion of a Black employee justifies an inference of prejudice against white co-workers in our present society.”\\n\\nAccordingly, the DC Circuit announced that “majority plaintiffs” in Title VII cases must demonstrate early in their lawsuit that the defendant is the “unusual employer who discriminates against the majority.” A handful of other federal appeals courts, including the Sixth Circuit, have since embraced this rule.\\n\\nIt is, frankly, baffling that this rule survived as long as it has. Title VII makes no distinctions between suits brought by majority plaintiffs and suits brought by members of a minority group. And the Supreme Court’s decisions stating that Title VII suits by members of historically privileged groups should be treated no differently than any other Title VII suit stretch back decades, long before the Republican Party’s hard turn against DEI programs of all kinds.\\n\\nTitle VII states that it is illegal for an employer to discriminate against anyone “because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” That’s broad language that applies to white, Christian, male, and American workers no differently than it does to anyone else. (Bostock held that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a form of “sex” discrimination, which is why Ames’s case may be brought under Title VII.)\\n\\nSimilarly, a unanimous Supreme Court held in McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transportation Co. (1976) that “Title VII prohibits racial discrimination against” white people “upon the same standards as would be applicable” if they were Black. The author of that statement, by the way, was Justice Thurgood Marshall, the legendary civil rights lawyer who argued Brown v. Board of Education.\\n\\nFive years before the DC Circuit created the background circumstances rule, in other words, a unanimous Supreme Court held that courts should decide Title VII suits brought by members of the majority “upon the same standards” as suits brought by a minority plaintiff. The DC Circuit should have followed the Supreme Court’s decision in McDonald, rather than creating a rule that’s inconsistent with the Court’s holding.\\n\\nThere are also serious practical difficulties in applying a rule that treats members of a majority group differently than members of a minority, at least in these circumstances. Women, for example, slightly outnumber men in the United States. Does that mean that a man alleging employment discrimination carries a lower burden than a similarly situated woman?\\n\\nSimilarly, the background circumstances rule could cause a case to turn on very fine distinctions regarding an employer’s motives.\\n\\nSuppose, for example, that a worker alleges they were fired because their boss objected to Catholic iconography displayed on the worker’s desk. Catholics make up about 20 percent of the US population, so if this case is characterized as anti-Catholic discrimination, the plaintiff will not have to demonstrate the background circumstances required by the DC and Sixth Circuits.\\n\\nBut Christians as a whole make up a majority of the US population. So if this exact same case is reframed as a case about discrimination against Christians, rather than a case about Catholics, then the background circumstances rule would apply.\\n\\nAll of which is to say: The law has been clear for a half-century that Title VII does not draw distinctions between majority and minority plaintiffs. And this particular rule is hard to apply to a large number of potential cases.\\n\\nThere is some risk that the Court will use this case to make a broader attack on DEI programs\\n\\nThe Court could hand down a narrow opinion in Ames that, much like Justice Marshall’s McDonald opinion, simply announces that Title VII does not draw distinctions based on majority or minority status. But the Court also has a Republican majority, and the Republican Party is currently on a tear against DEI programs of all kinds. So it is possible that a majority of the justices will join a broader opinion in Ames.\\n\\nThough Ames’s own brief largely makes a modest attack on the background circumstances rule, a few briefs filed by right-wing legal organizations suggest a more aggressive approach. One implies that DEI programs of all kinds are a form of invidious discrimination, claiming that “the rise of governments and private businesses embracing diversity, inclusion, and equity initiatives (DEI) means that discrimination pervades the modern workplace.” A few quote Judge James Ho, a Trump judge known for making trollish legal arguments, who argues that “diversity has increasingly become a code word for discrimination.”\\n\\nRelated The edgelord of the federal judiciary\\n\\nThe reality is that “DEI” is a broad and somewhat vague term that encompasses both programs that are unquestionably illegal (such as racial quotas), and also more benign programs such as enabling workers to form affinity groups based on their identity, or holding recruitment drives at historically Black colleges and universities in order to identify highly qualified Black job applicants.\\n\\nAt the very least, the Court should look at each of the various programs that can fit under the “DEI” umbrella individually, rather than issuing a blanket statement that may sweep too broadly.'},\n",

But anti-abortion activists said the measures violate free-speech rights and should be on their “deathbed” after the justices overturned Roe v. Wade and the nationwide right to abortion.\\n\\nOne case comes from Carbondale, Illinois, which is located near the state’s southern border and passed an ordinance after becoming a destination for patients from nearby states with abortion bans. The measure was quickly challenged in court, and has never been enforced. The city argued the appeal should be tossed because the ordinance was repealed shortly before abortion opponents went to the Supreme Court.\\n\\nThe other case is from New Jersey, where activist Jeryl Turco says she has approached women in Englewood for years to try to convince them not to have abortions. She says an 8-foot demonstration-free zone the city passed in 2014 in response to an aggressive group of protesters also wrongly kept her from approaching women.\\n\\nREAD MORE: New York doctor indicted over online prescription of abortion pill in Louisiana\\n\\nEnglewood argues that Turco has still been able to share her message outside of the immediate area near clinic entrances. Lower courts have ultimately upheld the ordinance, finding it isn’t a major First Amendment burden.\\n\\nBoth challengers pointed out that the high court struck down a Massachusetts law creating 35-foot demonstration free “buffer zones” around clinic doors in 2014. They say the Illinois and New Jersey laws should meet the same fate.\\n\\nBut cities say their rules are in line with a different Supreme Court decision from 2000, when the high court allowed a Colorado law to stand. It barred people from getting within 8 feet of others without permission in a 100-foot “bubble zone” around clinics.\\n\\nThomas said that case, known as Hill v. Colorado, was wrongly decided. In a dissent from the decision to decline the Illinois case, he said that the court wrongly treated it differently than other First Amendment cases because abortion was involved. “Hill has been seriously undermined, if not completely eroded, and our refusal to provide clarity is an abdication of our judicial duty,” he wrote.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'It was bound to happen sooner or later. From The Washington Post:\\n\\nThe administration asked the Supreme Court on Sunday to clear the way for the president to fire the leader of an independent agency that investigates whistleblower reports filed by government workers—the first time President Donald Trump has appealed to the justices for help in his efforts to remake and seize greater control of the federal bureaucracy. Hampton Dellinger, the head of the Office of Special Counsel, sued the Trump administration after he was fired in a one-sentence email this month. Dellinger said his termination was illegal because it violated a law that shields leaders of independent agencies from removal by the president, “except in cases of neglect of duty, malfeasance or inefficiency.”\\n\\nThe Constitution gives the president the power to remove top executive branch officials for no reason or any reason at all, but Congress has passed legislation that protects certain officials from being fired without cause in an attempt to ensure their independence. In recent years, however, the conservative Supreme Court has taken steps to expand presidential power, most notably when it found last summer that Trump—and future presidents—are immune from criminal prosecution for their official actions. Trump’s early actions are also testing to what extent Congress and the courts can restrain executive authority and asking the justices to define those boundaries.\\n\\nBy requesting the Supreme Court to step in, the president is putting it to Roberts very plainly. He expects his carefully manufactured conservative majority on the court to endorse his wild smash-and-grab spree throughout the executive branch. This is a naked demand for the judiciary to act as a tool of the executive.\\n\\n“This Court should not allow lower courts to seize executive power by dictating to the President how long he must continue employing an agency head against his will,” Sarah M. Harris, acting solicitor general, wrote in the emergency filing provided by the Justice Department but not yet officially docketed and posted on the Supreme Court’s website.\\n\\nThe problem with that is that the executive, which the current president did not invent, despite what Stephen Miller and Elon Musk may have whispered into his comb-over, already has agreed to certain exceptions to the president’s hiring and firing process by agreeing to a congressional resolution that would put restrictions on the president’s power to hire and fire. Moreover, it’s the price Roberts is expected to pay for the court majority of his dreams, even more than the immunity decision was. Sooner or later, the devil delivers the bill.\\n\\nHappy Presidents’ Day!'},\n",

       "   'content': 'I get the feeling that the sooner that trial in the Manhattan courthouse goes to jury, the better for us all, because it seems to me that, here in the homestretch, the entire exercise is in danger of going to the zoo and never returning. Inside the courtroom, defense attorney Todd Blanche has led Michael Cohen through all the shenanigans in which he engaged on the former president*’s behalf in an attempt to delegitimize everything Cohen has done since flipping on his former boss, apparently in the belief that nobody outside the courthouse has ever a seen a legal drama in which somebody “turns state’s.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOutside, in a desperate attempt to keep the public’s interest, the TV coverage is starting to slide toward the notion that Blanche has been brilliant in his cross-examination of Cohen. Meanwhile, someone released a series of penis-shaped balloons with the names and faces of various Trump antagonists attached to them. In addition, Thursday’s emissaries from the cult’s Washington outpost included Reps. Lauren Boebert, Matt Gaetz, Andy Biggs, and Anna Paulina Luna in what can fairly be called the D-Team. At least nine of them were there and, as The Hill shrewdly pointed out, this completely banjaxed the GOP’s wafer-thin majority in the House.\\n\\nThe trip to New York comes on what was scheduled to be a busy day in particular for the House Oversight Committee and the House Judiciary Committee. Both had scheduled morning hearings for a top GOP priority: holding Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress.\\n\\n\\n\\nA source confirmed to The Hill on Wednesday that the last-minute shift in the Oversight schedule was to allow the lawmakers to make the trip to New York. Trekking to Trump’s trial means Gaetz and Biggs will miss the Judiciary hearing on the matter, while Oversight members such as Boebert and Luna may be back for the hearing that has since been moved to 8 p.m. EDT. “Due to member schedule conflicts, the markup is now starting at a different time to accommodate members’ schedules,” a spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee told The Hill on Wednesday.\\n\\nAny late return could also complicate other matters for House Republicans. The chamber is voting at 4 p.m. on a bill to reverse Biden’s hold on certain transfers of arms to Israel. The White House has said Biden would veto the bill. A number of Democrats had signaled some support for the measure, but Democratic leaders are now whipping against it. As a result, heavy absences by Republicans could make it difficult for GOP leaders to get it across the finish line.\\n\\nNaturally, the business of governing the nation must give way to their obligation to go to New York to pay homage to their God-Emperor Schitzinpants. The difference between the members of Thursday’s congressional pilgrimage and the clutch of penis-shaped balloons that took flight not far from them isn’t vast.'},\n",

The defense called as its first witness one Robert Costello, who once advised prime prosecution witness Michael Cohen. (Costello was a close associate of Rudy Giuliani, which figures.) Costello has been a critic of the state’s case in the Stormy Daniels payoff case, and of Cohen, once the latter hit the silk on the former president*. There was extended legal wrangling over whether Costello could testify at all and, at least, about the limits of what he would be allowed to say. Once he got on the stand, however, he put on a very impressive show. Judge Juan Merchan was not amused. From The Guardian:\\n\\nJudge Juan Merchan ordered the courtroom cleared of reporters after warning Robert Costello about his responses to sustained objections. “I want to discuss proper decorum in my courtroom,” Merchan said. “So when there’s a witness on the stand and you don’t like my ruling, you don’t say ‘jeez,’ and you don’t say ‘strike it.’ Because I’m the only one who can strike....You don’t roll your eyes, do you understand that? Do you understand that? Are you staring me down right now?”\\n\\n“Clear the courtroom,” he then ordered.\\n\\nThe media have been allowed back inside after Judge Juan Merchan ordered to clear the courtroom. Court officers and Merchan would not let an attorney for the press make an application to argue for the right to stay in the courtroom.

       "   'content': 'There are other courthouses in other places. They’re not in Washington. They’re the repair shops of the law. They hammer out the dents that result from the collisions of ordinary people living ordinary lives. And they’re where the law comes closest to Atticus Finch’s optimism. They’re where the leveling happens. —Something I Wrote Once\\n\\n\\n\\nLong ago, I learned a valuable lesson about verdicts in criminal cases. The lesson conforms to the late William Goldman’s classic assessment of Hollywood: Nobody Knows Anything. This is especially true in that tremulous time between when the case goes to the jury and when the jury comes back with a verdict. Once, while covering a political-corruption case at The Boston Phoenix, we killed that time in the best possible way. Somebody got up a poker game in the press room. (Heavens to Hildy Johnson!) At one point, a court officer poked his head in to remind us that gambling in a federal courthouse was, you know, non-legal. “Yeah, right,” we replied. “I’ll raise you a quarter.”\\n\\nRelated Story The Truth About Trump That Only the Courts See\\n\\nThe chatter over the nickels and dimes was all about what the extended deliberations “meant.” This is the oldest sucker’s bet in journalism. Nobody can tell what twelve individual minds can divine from the evidence presented, let alone how they can come to agree unanimously on what that evidence proves one way or another. Nobody knows anything, and only a fool would bet on it. (Brief Historical Note: The jury in that trial came back quickly, and the defendant was acquitted. I came away half a buck ahead.)\\n\\nWhen the jury—and, therefore, the System—brought down the ten-pound hammer on the former president* Thursday afternoon, it also shattered much of the instant, freeze-dried speculation. There was no acquittal. There was no hung jury. There was no “mixed verdict.” There were thirty-four felony counts and there were thirty-four guilty verdicts, and it took the jury less than a day to bring that gravid judgment back. I would never call their job easy. There were death threats in the air throughout the trial. There were thick clouds of squid ink billowing from the defense table. And the defendant was formerly the president* of the United States. But when the jury left the courtroom and went in back to deliberate, all extraneous ballyhoo evidently fell away and all the crooked places were made straight. Left alone with the evidence and their own common sense, the members of the jury brought strength and clarity to the proceedings, to themselves, and, one hopes fervently, to the country as well.\\n\\nThe Executive was crooked. The national legislature was inert. And the independent judiciary, at its most common level, stepped up and did its job. This is how that whole “separation of powers” thing was designed to work. Now we can only hope that a good New York jury and a brave New York judge have shamed the Supreme Court into tossing the spurious “executive immunity” claim onto the ash heap where it belongs and that, down in Florida, Judge Aileen (Slow Loris) Cannon will take a lesson from Juan Merchan on what being a judge is supposed to be about.\\n\\nDonald Trump is a convicted felon. Stormy Daniels is an American hero. And a little porn star shall lead them.\\n\\nCase closed, motherf*ckers.\\n\\nRelive the Magic: More Charlie on Trump’s Hush-Money Trial'},\n",

       "   'content': 'As long as nobody calls it a cult or anything.\\n\\nOn Monday, two United States senators, Tommy Tuberville and J.D. Vance, took a pilgrimage to the Manhattan courthouse in which Michael Cohen was explaining to a jury everything he did while being paid by the former president* to be a schmuck to the entire outside world. By all accounts, Cohen was a model witness, though we should hold all tickets on that bet until we see how he does under cross-examination. Far more interesting were the two legislative acolytes who came to pay homage. It’s like the courthouse is now Fatima, with farts. From Politico:\\n\\nOn Monday, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen faced ridicule from Trump’s entourage visiting the courthouse, including GOP Sens. J.D. Vance of Ohio and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, as the prosecution’s star witness had his first day on the stand. “This guy is a convicted felon who admitted in his testimony that he secretly recorded his former employer, that he only did it once allegedly, and that this was supposed to help Donald Trump,” Vance told reporters outside the courthouse. “Does any reasonable, sensible person believe anything that Michael Cohen says?”\\n\\n“We got a courtroom, this most depressing thing I’ve ever been in,” Tuberville said. “Mental anguish is trying to be pushed on the Republican candidate for the president of the United States.”\\n\\nAnd they weren’t alone. The senators were joined in their witness by Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, Republican of New York, as well as the attorneys general of Iowa and Alabama, who apparently have little to do these days. Taxpayers in those two states certainly got their money’s worth paying the salaries of these two clucks. Moreover, Tuesday promised even more pilgrims to the shrine. Vivek Ramaswamy, re-emerging from having his operating systems updated, promised to come and pay tribute, as did Speaker of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson.\\n\\nFor the benefit of those keeping score at home, Speaker Moses, who is a very good Christian man, is going to New York to support an unapologetic defendant in a criminal scheme that violated at least half the Ten Commandments. That should be a tinhorn tent revival of a type unseen since Jimmy Swaggart took to the podium and tearfully copped to doing missionary work in various motels in the neighborhood we like to call Out by the Airport. It is Politico’s analysis that these pilgrims are coming to court in order to meet the press and say all the stuff the defendant can’t say because Judge Juan Merchan may toss him in the hoosegow.

It has asked Google to fully restore the name “Gulf of Mexico” to its Maps service for areas outside U.S. territory. “What Google is doing here is changing the name of the continental shelf of Mexico and Cuba,” Sheinbaum told reporters.\\n\\nSo she’s threatening to ... sue Google for bending the knee on the Gulf. But this isn’t really about Google, no matter how President Sheinbaum pretends it is. This is meant to get all up in the grill of the vainglorious lout in the White House. She is quite clearly laughing at his mighty sword. (Why do they laugh at his mighty sword?) And she is encouraging the rest of the world to laugh at it, too.\\n\\nI have no idea about the legality of it all. Can the Mexican government sue an American company on an issue like this? Is there a court of competent jurisdiction that could determine the relative evidentiary value of continental shelves?\\n\\nSheinbaum said Mexico then wrote to Google to explain that under international maritime law, a country’s sovereignty over its territorial sea extends to a maximum of 12 nautical miles. She shared a copy of the letter, dated Feb. 11, in which Mexico’s Foreign Secretary Juan Ramón de la Fuente stated that “under no circumstance will Mexico accept the renaming of a geographic zone within its own territory and under its jurisdiction” and would take legal action if necessary.\\n\\nI’m sorry Google got in the way.

       "   'content': 'The film \"The Apprentice\", starring Sebastian Stan as a younger Donald Trump, has made waves in both Hollywood and Washington, D.C., since its May 2024 premiere at the Cannes Film Festival.\\n\\nThe film helped Stan and co-star Jeremy Strong earn their first Oscar nominations for playing Trump and New York City lawyer Roy Cohn, respectively.\\n\\nThe story follows Stan as a younger Trump in the 1970s and 1980s -- then an ambitious businessman -- as he befriends power lawyer and political \"fixer\" Cohn. Cohn and Trump\\'s blossoming friendship takes center stage in the film as the future president looks to Cohn for personal and professional guidance while building his real estate empire.\\n\\nTrump has expressed displeasure with the film and its portrayal of him, and his team has also threatened legal action against the movie.\\n\\nStan, Strong and the film\\'s director Ali Abbasi have all responded to Trump\\'s comments on the film.\\n\\nBelow, read what Trump has said about the movie and the film\\'s response.\\n\\nTrump calls \\'The Apprentice\\' a \\'fake\\' and \\'classless\\' film\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump speaks at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla., Feb. 18, 2025. Sebastian Stan in \"The Apprentice,\" 2024. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters | Briarcliff Entertainment\\n\\n\"The Apprentice\" first premiered at the 77th Cannes Film Festival on May 20, 2024, before receiving a wider theatrical release in the U.S. in October.\\n\\nIn an early morning social media post on Oct. 14, then-presidential candidate Trump skewered the film, rejecting its accuracy -- particularly its portrayal of him -- and expressing his hope that the film, which he called \"fake and classless,\" would fail at the box office.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country, \\'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\'\" he wrote at the time.\\n\\nHe also addressed the film\\'s portrayal of his relationship with his first wife, the late Ivana Trump, to whom he was married from 1977 to 1990. The film depicts the pair\\'s courtship and ensuing deteriorating relationship and contains a rape scene based on Ivana Trump\\'s 1990 divorce deposition, in which she accused her estranged husband of allegedly raping her once. Ivana Trump walked back the allegation, which was also referenced in the 1993 biography \"Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump\" by Harry Hurt III, on multiple occasions prior to her death in 2022. President Trump has denied the rape allegation, saying in a statement at the time \"Lost Tycoon\" was published that allegation was \"obviously false.\"\\n\\n\"My former wife, Ivana, was a kind and wonderful person, and I had a great relationship with her until the day she died. The writer of this pile of garbage, Gabe Sherman, a lowlife and talentless hack, who has long been widely discredited, knew that, but chose to ignore it,\" President Trump wrote in his October social media post.\\n\\nTrump team threatens legal action against \\'The Apprentice\\'\\n\\nTrump\\'s campaign team threatened legal action against the film in May 2024, according to multiple reports.\\n\\n\"We will be filing a lawsuit to address the blatantly false assertions from these pretend filmmakers,\" Steven Cheung, Trump\\'s then-chief campaign spokesperson, who became White House communications director when Trump took office for a second term in January, said in a statement to Variety at the time. \"This garbage is pure fiction which sensationalizes lies that have been long debunked.\"\\n\\n\"This \\'film\\' is pure malicious defamation, should not see the light of day, and doesn\\'t even deserve a place in the straight-to-DVD section of a bargain bin at a soon-to-be-closed discount movie store, it belongs in a dumpster fire,\" the statement read.\\n\\nAccording to Variety, Trump\\'s attorneys sent a cease and desist letter to the filmmakers in May, in hopes of blocking its release in the U.S.\\n\\nIn response to the letter, the producers of the film stated to Variety, \"The film is a fair and balanced portrait of the former president.\"\\n\\nThe producers added, \"We want everyone to see it and then decide.\"\\n\\nSebastian Stan responds to Trump\\'s criticism\\n\\nThis image released by Briarcliff Entertainment shows Maria Bakalova, left, and Sebastian Stan in a scene from the film \"The Apprentice.\" Pief Weyman/Briarcliff Entertainment via AP\\n\\nThe film\\'s star Stan responded to Trump\\'s criticism and threats in an interview with NPR\\'s \"Fresh Air\" podcast with Terry Gross in February.\\n\\n\"If the movie is really just sort of so irrelevant, then why warrant that reaction from him to begin with?\" Stan replied when asked about Trump\\'s reaction to the film.\\n\\n\"It might be because the truth hurts, and there is something truthful to the movie, one of them probably being that, you know, he doesn\\'t like anyone else taking credit for the way he is,\" he continued.\\n\\nStan also addressed Trump\\'s post in an Oct. 15 interview with On Demand Entertainment at the BFI London Film Festival.\\n\\n\"It\\'s disappointing,\" he said at the time. \"I think it\\'s also unsettling how easily he can toss around such terrible words. But it\\'s also very predictable -- he\\'s so negative and just continues to want to divide people, because that\\'s when he feels he has any relevance.\"\\n\\nIn an interview earlier this month with the New York Times, Stan called his portrayal of Trump \"a well-crafted character built from rage and years of suppression.\"\\n\\nHe also speculated on Trump\\'s displeasure with the film, suggesting that \"one of the issues he\\'s probably had with the film is it really shows you the opportunistic evolution of this person.\"\\n\\nStan claimed the fear surrounding the sensitivities of this film became apparent when he said he couldn\\'t find a partner to discuss the film for Variety\\'s Actors on Actors series, where stars discuss their films with each other.\\n\\n\"I couldn\\'t find another actor to do it with me, because they were too afraid to go and talk about this movie, so I couldn\\'t do it,\" he said at a screening in November speaking alongside Abbasi, who reposted the video on social media. \"That\\'s not pointing at anyone specific, it was we couldn\\'t get past the publicists, who were the people representing them.\"\\n\\nVariety reported it could not match Stan with another actor for the project.\\n\\nJeremy Strong weighs in on Trump\\'s comments\\n\\nThis image released by Briarcliff Entertainment shows Jeremy Strong, left, and Sebastian Stan in a scene from the film \"The Apprentice.\" Pief Weyman/Briarcliff Entertainment via AP\\n\\nIn October, after Trump\\'s post about the film, Strong told the BBC he felt he was in a \"slightly precarious and slightly dangerous\" situation.\\n\\n\"Art is meant to speak truth to power. We don\\'t often do that with consequences. The specter of consequences weighs heavily on me,\" he said.\\n\\nStrong also claimed that writer Gabriel Sherman had been on the receiving end of death threats and antisemitic hate after Trump\\'s post.\\n\\nIn an interview with Variety in early October, Strong also called the film a \"Frankenstein\" movie in the way he said it handles Cohn\\'s creation of the modern-day Trump.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a monster movie. It\\'s a Frankenstein movie. It\\'s about the creation of a monster by another monster,\" he said at the time.\\n\\n\\'The Apprentice\\' director responds to Trump\\'s comments\\n\\n\"The Apprentice\" director Abbasi responded to Trump\\'s rebuke of the film on X on Oct. 14, 2024.\\n\\n\"Thanks for getting back to us @realDonaldTrump,\" he wrote at the time. \"I am available to talk further if you want. Today is a tight day w a lot of press for #TheApprentice but i might be able to give you a call tomorrow.\"\\n\\nAbbasi also elaborated on his reaction to Trump\\'s comments in October on the CBC podcast \"Q With Tom Power.\"\\n\\n\"I have to say, I don\\'t understand why he\\'s so angry…. [We] try to depict him in a human way, complex way with a lot of nuances, a lot of care. So I think I was expecting a thank-you letter or something like that,\" he said.'},\n",

After the Pledge, Marocco outlined the Trump administration\\'s foreign aid plans, defending what he called a \"total zero-based review,\" and arguing that some areas of foreign aid required \"radical change\" before taking questions from those in attendance, according to an audio recording of the private meeting obtained by ABC News.\\n\\n\\'Nefarious actors in the agencies\\'\\n\\nMultiple sources who attended the Feb. 13 meeting described the mood in the room as \"deeply uncomfortable,\" saying that some of the attendees who were representing groups teetering on bankruptcy were left \"traumatized\" by the tone and the lack of specific details.\\n\\nDuring the discussion, a representative for World Vision, a global Christian humanitarian organization, asked Marocco about the impact of the freeze, noting that aid groups like his had been forced to bankroll U.S. government-funded programs with private money while awaiting overdue payments to be unpaused.\\n\\n\"Will the spigot open? We\\'ve gotten waivers, but the PMS system isn\\'t operating, so we\\'re bankrolling U.S. government-funded programs out of private money,\" said Edward Brown, the vice president of World Vision, which provides poverty alleviation, disaster relief, and child welfare in nearly 100 countries.\\n\\nMarocco responded that following President Donald Trump\\'s executive order halting foreign aid, some transactions were still being processed, prompting his team to \"seize control\" of the payment system to stop them -- leaving some groups without payments that, weeks later, had still had not arrived.\\n\\n\"As far as payment, one of the reasons that there have been problems with some of the payments is because, despite the president\\'s executive order, despite the secretary\\'s guidance, we still had nefarious actors in the agencies that were trying to push out hundreds of illegal payments,\" Marocco said. \"And so we were able to seize control of that, stop them, take control of some of those people, and make sure that that money was not getting out the door.\"\\n\\nMarocco suggested that payments for organizations with existing contracts would resume the following Tuesday.\\n\\n\"I feel confident we\\'re going to have that pretty good by Tuesday of next week,\" he said. \"That does not mean everybody\\'s going to be caught up on everything that they want. But I think that our payment system will probably be fluid at that point.\"\\n\\nBut Tuesday came and went, and many groups say they were still on the edge of bankruptcy -- prompting some to escalate their legal battle against the administration.\\n\\nOn Monday, several USAID officials told ABC News that the payment system Marocco said would be fully restored was now technically operational, but that funding was still moving at an extremely slow pace and that many of the programs that were granted waivers to continue operations had still not received any money.\\n\\nUSAID officials said the lack of funding has rendered many of the exempted programs inoperative. Some have resorted to using stockpiled resources, but because these programs have been cut off from federal support for weeks, most report that they have few funds left and don\\'t anticipate they will be able to function for much longer, according to the officials.\\n\\nOn Friday, after a federal judge cleared the way for the administration to proceed with its plan to pull thousands of USAID staffers off the job in the U.S. and around the world, the Trump administration moved forward with its effort to dismantle USAID, telling all but a fraction of staffers worldwide that they were on leave as of Monday.\\n\\nIn a court-ordered affidavit filed last Tuesday, Marocco wrote that the agency \"has authorized at least 21 payments\" for grants, loans, and other foreign aid executed before Trump\\'s inauguration \"that are in total worth more than $250 million and are expected to be paid this week.\"\\n\\nAs of Monday, it was not clear whether those payments had been made.\\n\\nWhen reached for comment, World Vision would not confirm to ABC News if payments had resumed, but told ABC News they were \"complying with the executive order that pauses U.S. foreign assistance funding -- with potential waivers for emergency food and lifesaving humanitarian assistance -- for the next 90 days, while programs are reviewed for alignment with the current administration\\'s foreign policy.\"\\n\\n\\'What we consider to be legitimate\\'\\n\\nIn one tense moment during the listening session, a senior Democratic Senate staffer pressed Marocco on whether, once the payments resumed, they would include reimbursements for work incurred before the Jan. 24 freeze.\\n\\n\"When payments resume, will they include work incurred before Jan. 24 in the payments forthcoming on Tuesday?\" asked the staffer, who, when reached for comment by ABC News, asked not to be named our of fear of retribution.\\n\\nMarocco would not guarantee that government-contracted work that occurred before the freeze would be reimbursed, stating that the Trump administration would only cover \"legitimate expenses\" -- and noting that the administration\\'s definition of a legitimate expense may differ from the groups in the room.\\n\\n\"We will be looking at those,\" Marocco said. \"What we consider to be legitimate may not be the same thing that other people consider to be legitimate, but we\\'re going to.\"\\n\\nThe staffer attempted to follow up, arguing that if the work had been incurred before the freeze, \"it was legitimate at the time, right?\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ve moved on to the next person,\" Marocco responded.\\n\\nIn his affidavit filed on Tuesday, Marocco conveyed the scope and status of the government\\'s aid freeze. He wrote that, since Trump signed the executive order for a 90-day freeze, USAID had terminated nearly 500 grants and contracts. He said the agency \"has not quantified\" the total cost of those programs.\\n\\nAs of Tuesday, the State Department had terminated more than 750 foreign assistance-funded grants and contracts of its own and had suspended nearly 7,000 more, Marocco wrote.\\n\\nA \\'cycle of dependency\\'\\n\\nMarocco used the meeting with the organizations to paint a dire picture of U.S. foreign aid, claiming it had \"devolved into a fiscal cycle of dependency, of presumption, arrogance, and frankly, folly, that is just astonishing.\" He dismissed past reform efforts as ineffective, arguing that officials had merely \"nibbled around the edges\" rather than addressing what he saw as systemic failures.\\n\\nHe insisted the review was necessary to force difficult conversations about \"what these programs are actually doing\" and whether they should continue at all. And he framed the overhaul as part of President Trump\\'s broader effort to reshape Washington\\'s approach to foreign assistance.\\n\\n\"The American people deserve better. They require better. And President Trump has promised better,\" he said, criticizing aid decisions made \"behind closed doors in Congress, in small groups in Washington, D.C.\"\\n\\nMarocco told those gathered that the administration\\'s review extended beyond USAID and would encompass a range of federal agencies, including NASA, the Patent and Trademark Office, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM).\\n\\n\"If there is a tax dollar that is going out to a foreigner, we need to gain control of that and understand what it is we\\'re trying to achieve with our partners,\" he said. \"We want to identify all of that. We want to fix it. That\\'s the goal.\"\\n\\nMarocco made clear that the new foreign aid structure would be tied to Trump\\'s political priorities.\\n\\n\"With the Secretary of State, you will be in line,\" Marocco said. \"The foreign assistance review, you will follow the president\\'s foreign policy objectives. Or you will not be spending money abroad.\"\\n\\nHe told the aid groups in the room they needed to justify their programs.\\n\\n\"You need to think about convincing someone -- perhaps one of the women who is in my mother\\'s Bible study,\" he said. \"You need to think about somebody who\\'s working at a McDonald\\'s in Mississippi. You need to think about a grad student in Harlem.\"\\n\\nThe Trump administration has received widespread condemnation from Democrats in Congress over its effort to slash foreign aid programs. \"What Trump and Musk have done is not only wrong, it\\'s illegal,\" Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia said earlier this month during a news conference outside USAID headquarters. \"USAID was established by an act of Congress, and it can only be disbanded by an act of Congress. Stopping this will require action by the courts and for Republicans to show up and show courage and stand up for our country.\"\\n\\n\\'Catastrophic\\' harm\\n\\nThe Feb. 13 meeting came as the legal battle over the aid freeze was escalating. Last week, a coalition of aid groups asked a federal judge to intervene, arguing that the freeze violated existing funding agreements and had caused \"catastrophic\" harm to their humanitarian missions. U.S. District Judge Amir Ali issued a temporary restraining order halting the freeze, but aid organizations said their funding remained locked, leaving them scrambling to keep operations afloat.\\n\\nLate Tuesday, Trump administration attorneys filed court papers arguing that their interpretation of the judge\\'s order allows the freeze to largely remain in place. The aid groups fired back Wednesday, urging the court to enforce the ruling.\\n\\n\"The court should not brook such brazen defiance of the express terms of its order,\" they wrote in the filing.\\n\\nJudge Ali, a Biden-era appointee, wrote Thursday that while Trump administration officials had \"not complied\" with his order, he would not hold them in contempt of court.\\n\\nBut he warned those officials not to buck what he characterized as his \"clear\" directive to lift their \"blanket freeze\" on aid disbursements.'},\n",

About 20,000 jobs will be created over those four years, Apple said, \"of which the vast majority will be focused on R&D, silicon engineering, software development, and AI and machine learning.\"\\n\\nApple\\'s plans include building a 250,000-square-foot server-manufacturing facility in Houston—which will open in 2026 and \"play a key role in powering Apple Intelligence\" and supporting AI cloud computing, Apple said. The tech giant will also \"continue expanding data center capacity in North Carolina, Iowa, Oregon, Arizona, and Nevada,\" Apple\\'s blog said.\\n\\nPerhaps most significant among investments is the plan to double Apple\\'s US Advanced Manufacturing Fund (AMF). That fund largely promotes \"advanced manufacturing and skills development,\" Apple said. But in spiking AMF investments from $5 to $10 billion, Apple also committed to spending several billion on advanced chips produced at an Arizona fab built by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).\\n\\nThat plant is expected to help secure America\\'s domestic supply of advanced chips, and Apple confirmed that \"mass production of Apple chips\" previously reliant on access to TSMC\\'s Taiwan packaging facilities began last month in Arizona. In December, TSMC Arizona Chairman Rick Cassidy told CNBC that after moving past forecast delays, the Arizona fab is currently \"right on par\" with Taiwan fabs where CNBC noted \"about 92 percent of the world’s most advanced chips are currently made.\" Apple\\'s investments could help redirect some of TSMC\\'s Taiwanese business toward the US.'},\n",

Kennedy Jr. became the country\\'s top health official, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has already pulled back some of its efforts to protect Americans with safe, lifesaving vaccines. The agency has indefinitely postponed a public meeting of its vaccine advisory committee and killed a campaign promoting seasonal flu shots.\\n\\nLast weekend, a Washington Post columnist noted on Bluesky that the CDC\\'s effective \"Wild to Mild\" seasonal flu shot campaign had vanished. The campaign highlighted how the seasonal vaccines can prevent influenza infections from becoming severe or life-threatening. It used animals as an analogy for the diminished threat of the flu virus after vaccination, juxtaposing a lion and a domestic kitten in one ad while showing an elephant and a mouse in another. The CDC page no longer leads to a \"not found\" landing page, but it wasn\\'t restored either. It now redirects to a 2023 article announcing the campaign, which does not contain the shareable resources found on the original page. The removal is startling given that the US is currently battling one of the worst flu seasons in 15 years.\\n\\nNPR first reported that CDC staff were told in a meeting Wednesday, February 19, the campaign was halted. In a story Thursday, Stat News added more context to the decision. According to the outlet\\'s sources, the Department of Health and Human Services’ assistant secretary for public affairs informed the CDC that Kennedy wanted vaccine advertisements to emphasize \"informed consent\" instead.\\n\\nExperts told Stat that although informed consent is a must, an undue focus on potential harms could deter people from getting vaccinated. Flu vaccines have few and generally mild risks, including short-lived reactions at the injection site, headache, fatigue, fever, and muscle aches. The CDC notes that there is an inconsistent association between flu shots and Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a rare nerve condition. But, when an association is seen, it\\'s in the range of 1 or 2 cases per million flu shots administered.'},\n",

Rogers represents a California district known for its Bigfoot sightings (or \"sightings,\" depending on your persuasion—many of these have been faked), and he wants to make Bigfoot the \"official cryptid\" of the state.\\n\\nHis bill notes that California already has many official symbols, including the golden poppy (official flower), the California redwood (official tree), the word \"Eureka\" (official motto), the red-legged frog (official amphibian), the grizzly bear (official animal), swing dancing (official dance), and the saber-toothed cat (official fossil). The state has so many of these that there are separate categories for freshwater fish (golden trout) and marine fish (garibaldi). So why not, Rogers wants to know, \"designate Bigfoot as the official state cryptid\"?\\n\\nThat\\'s... pretty much the bill, which was introduced this week and already has Bigfoot advocates excited. SFGate talked to Matt Moneymaker, who it describes as \"a longtime Bigfoot researcher and former star of the Animal Planet series Finding Bigfoot,\" about the bill. Moneymaker loves it, noting that he has personally “had a face-to-face encounter one time, after which I was absolutely sure they existed because I had one about 20 feet in front of me, growling at me.”\\n\\nRogers represents California Assembly District 2, a sprawling expanse of Northern California that includes the town of Willow Grove, epicenter of the early Bigfoot sightings back in the 1950s. Today, the small community boasts the Bigfoot Museum, the Bigfoot Motel, and the Bigfoot Steakhouse—to say nothing of Bigfoot\\'s Barbershop, Bigfoot Equipment & Repair, and, of course, the Bigfoot Cannabis Company. The bill seems like an easy way to goose interest in Bigfoot and to reap the tourist dollars that come from that interest.\\n\\nThis is not to deny the underlying reality of a Bigfoot-like creature (though you can indeed count me among the extremely, extremely skeptical—surely most of these sightings are of bears). Moneymaker runs the Bigfoot Field Researchers\\' Organization, which tracks sightings across the US.

The Wall Street Journal confirmed that the contraption was quickly set up in the office Monday, meaning it was a part of his extensive Day 1 activities in the office.\\n\\nVideos by VICE\\n\\nAgain, I have to say you have to appreciate someone so committed to what they love. Now I’m just wondering to myself what I would install a button for. One for Michelob Ultra refills? Or a button that brings me soft pretzels whenever my heart desires? The opportunities are endless.\\n\\nDonald Trump’s Diet Coke Button is Back in Washington\\n\\nThe Coca-Cola company is well aware of Trump’s fandom of its beverages. They even gave him a commemorative bottle recently with an old-school soda bottle and a White House label on it that listed his Jan. 20 Inauguration Day. It was presented to him by the company’s CEO, James Quince.\\n\\nDuring his first term, the New York Times revealed just how obsessed he is with Diet Coke. Trump reportedly drinks 12 cans a day. There’s no way that’s healthy, right? I drink one of them, and I instantly hate myself for consuming the sugary drink.\\n\\nMore power to you, Trump. By this point, his body has gotta be comprised of 75% Diet Coke flowing through him.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'The family and friends of Johan Floderus, a Swedish diplomat potentially facing the death penalty in Iran, have told VICE News he has endured a “horrible situation” during his 20-month-long detention in a notorious Tehran prison.\\n\\nFlorerus, a 33-year-old working with Afghan refugees in Iran on behalf of the EU was detained in April 2022 at Tehran’s airport as he was visiting on a holiday trip and then accused of spying for Iran’s foes, in particular, Israel. He was charged and tried for “corruption on earth,” or stymieing the cause of the Iranian revolution, in the Islamic Republic’s religious courts, a charge that can be punished with death. He is the latest victim of a repeating pattern in which foreign nationals are entangled in a legal ordeal in Iran in order for the country’s ruling mullahs to extort money or other goals from the West.\\n\\nVideos by VICE\\n\\nAfraid that quiet diplomacy wasn’t working, Floderus’s loved ones broke their silence in December last year and, on Thursday, went to Brussels to hold an event to raise awareness of his case with European officials.\\n\\nFloderus’s sister Ingrid told VICE News: “We are very close with Johan and always spoke on almost a daily basis. He is such a freedom-loving and stubborn person. Since his arrest, we have been only able to talk a few times. I can’t imagine how horrible the situation he is in, but he is still full of life and trying to stay strong.”\\n\\n“Johan is someone full of life and always had a curious soul, and he always traveled around the world and spoke Farsi, and he visited Iran multiple times, and worked there.”\\n\\nJohan Floderus in a sup\\n\\nIn Iran, all foreign nationals are closely monitored, and their movements must be approved by local authorities. Despite repeated calls from both the EU and Sweden to release Floderus, the Iranian judiciary has insisted that they have enough evidence to prosecute him on espionage charges.\\n\\nThe Swede is held in Tehran’s Evin prison and his case is being handled by Branch 26 of the Revolutionary Court of Tehran, headed by the clerical judge, Iman Afshari, already notorious for his passing unjust prison sentences on political activists, artists, and women.\\n\\nLast Sunday, the court concluded Floderus’s hearing after five sessions in an almost-empty courtroom, which the Swedish man attended in a prison uniform with his state-appointed lawyer and translator. Mizan News, the Iranian judiciary’s official outlet, reported that the prosecutors accused Floderus of a “very extensive intelligence cooperation with the Zionist occupation regime,” and said that his travel history was clear evidence of his involvement in activities that “threaten Iran’s national security”.\\n\\nAfshari gave a week for Floderus’ lawyer to submit their defense, and did not give a verdict date.\\n\\nWant the best of VICE News straight to your inbox? Sign up here.\\n\\nDespite denials from the Iranian government, rights groups and Western governments have repeatedly accused the Islamic Republic of “hostage diplomacy” by using trumped-up charges such as “corruption on earth” to extract political concessions, release funds held abroad by international sanctions, or in prisoner exchanges.\\n\\nFloderus’s arrest is likely to put pressure on Sweden in the case of the arrest of Iranian former prison official Hamid Nouri.\\n\\nNouri was detained upon arrival at Stockholm Airport in November 2019, and later charged with involvement in the killing of thousands of Iranian political prisoners in 1988.\\n\\nJohan and his sister Ingrid.\\n\\nThe former prison official was sentenced to life “for grave breaches of international humanitarian law and murder,” by a Swedish court after the prosecution asked for the maximum penalty in July 2022. The outcome was hailed as a rare human rights success against Iranian regime officials, but outraged the government in Tehran, which called the case “politically motivated.”\\n\\nLast Sunday, the Iranian prosecutor asked for the maximum penalty in Floderus’s case – either life in prison or the death sentence given the “important nature and adverse affects of the accused’s actions.”\\n\\nThe diplomat’s family had kept quiet about the arrest on the advice of the Swedish authorities as they tried to resolve the issue through “silent diplomacy,” and launched a public campaign after the news broke out at the end of last year, and losing hope that Floderus would be released through back-channel talks.\\n\\n“Other governments go the distance to protect their citizens, and I hope that Sweden will do that too. Johan is my brother, and his freedom and well-being are the most important thing in the world. So of course I feel that you should use every tool in the toolbox,” said his sister, Ingrid.\\n\\nEmily Atkinson, a close friend of Floderus, said: “Johan is someone who always brings people together. We have been left with a massive gap in our life without him, and we are also being taken hostage by the appalling situation,” she said as she struggled to keep back tears during a conversation with VICE News\\n\\n“I want to say: Johan, hold on. We’re here for you. We’ve rallied for you. We’re speaking up for you, and we’re here waiting for you. Hold on and stay strong.”'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-07T10:38:04',\n",
       "   'content': 'This is a members-only article from the forthcoming comeback issue of VICE Magazine. To subscribe, visit our membership section—not only will you get four issues of the printed magazine each year, delivered to your door, you’ll also have exclusive early access to our best new documentaries and online content, as well as a raft of members’ perks.\\n\\nAt the outset of the year, Curtis Yarvin—the blogger whose vision of a new, autocratic U.S. is reportedly gaining traction within the Trump administration—leapt back into the mainstream spotlight, with a New York Times interview headlined: “Curtis Yarvin Says Democracy Is Done. Powerful Conservatives Are Listening.” The article was accompanied by a moody monochromatic portrait that exaggerates Yarvin’s jowls like a veristic bust. One animated version of the photo shows Yarvin ominously drumming his fingers on a table. The implication seems clear: Do those restless fingertips contain the fate of the nation?\\n\\nIncreasingly, Yarvin has been touted by the media as a key to understanding the American New Right—a Steve Bannonesque figurehead, but for its tech faction rather than its nativist-populist one. He’s a computer engineer who’s been blogging away for decades in the strange world of online ‘neoreaction’ under the dusty fairytale pseudonym “Mencius Moldbug,” and is best known for his idea that American democracy should be replaced by a monarchy that runs the country like a start-up and grants generous privileges to the tech-industrialist elites.\\n\\nThis has won Yarvin friends in high places. His relationship with billionaire venture capitalist mega-donor Peter Thiel is well publicized. Marc Andreessen and J.D. Vance have cited his work approvingly. Now, with Trump settling back into the White House and indebted to the Bay Area robber barons that helped put him there, it feels as though Yarvin’s public profile has decisively shifted—from geeky fringe blogger to a political-philosopher éminence grise who is laying the discursive groundwork for an “American Caesar.”\\n\\nClearly, this is how Yarvin wants to be perceived. But take him at face value, and you’re playing a losing game. You’re not going to find a Schmitt or a Machiavelli here, and the joke’s on you for expecting that. Instead, Yarvin is best understood as a kind of spokesperson for ten million brain-fried Twitter anons, a cohort he’s described as the “new public intellectuals” of our “digital age,” and whose scattershot, stream-of-consciousness tub-thumping is currently being reflected in some punchy U.S. government policy. Whether that’s down to Yarvin is hard to discern. It seems unlikely. Yet what’s undeniable is that he finds himself arriving into a cultural moment for which he feels precision-engineered. In Yarvin, Big Tech has found the perfect preachertroll to exalt the deliberate insanity of the ‘move fast and break things’ ethos it’s bringing to nation building, one who knows how to exploit “meme magic” to dream up new truths about the world. In times past, people would’ve called this ‘throwing lots of shit at a wall and seeing what sticks.’ Today, they call it disruption, hyperstition, accelerationism, the future.\\n\\nThis is why the whole thing makes more sense if you understand Yarvin as a Gen X tech geek playing the part of a poet-guru; someone who can help Silicon Valley sheath its scary, transhumanist vision of the future in ancient mysticism and boomer cool. Look: he’s trying to be Gabriele D’Annunzio in a leather jacket. He’s trying to harness the infinite sexuality of the poète maudit. He wants us to understand that he’s a prophet who has visions; that with his musings on the nature of elves, he’s somehow hallucinating the polity of the future. His swagger is a bit awkward. He’s a socialite who attracts a following of eccentrics. Some people have told me that it’s Yarvin who was responsible for redpilling a lot of the Silicon Valley fat cats, persuading them to indulge their god complexes, insisting that it’s actually chic to openly flirt with immiserating elites and outmoded racial theories, as a way of priming them to support Trump and whoever comes next.\\n\\nPlay video\\n\\nIn his interview with the NY Times, Yarvin displays some of the shifty mannerisms you might expect of a contrarian online troll, an identity that to his credit he has partly owned. His habit of peppering italics through his writing is a way of signposting profundity where more often than not, there isn’t any. If you were to lay out his political program in his own style, it could be abridged such: America needs to stop edging and gooning and elect a bareback President, one who is given free rein to be orders of magnitude more powerful. Sounds delectably depraved, doesn’t it? And yet what he really means by that is none other than FDR— ‘And you libs like FDR, don’t you?’ he snickers. The fans are in on the joke but the outsiders tend to give up in frustration—there’s no ‘there’ there, they complain; it’s incoherent and contradictory, it’s childish, it’s a testament to the intellectual vacuity of fascism, there’s no way this sophist charlatan can have any real influence, and so on. Open the schools!\\n\\nOver the past few years I’ve had a bunch of funny encounters with Yarvin in New York, which he visits somewhat regularly, as if to make routine pilgrimage to the ancestral home of the Beat Generation. The first was a sunny summer day in 2022, at a meetup he had scheduled for his Substack subscribers in a park by the Hudson River. (He sometimes sends out newsletters advertising meetups in various cities; he once even put out a dating call to meet “someone of childbearing age.”) Dozens of Oxford shirt-wearing College Republicans surrounded the master, whose shoulder-length hair rested on his loose, half-buttoned saffron shirt that reminded me of the robes of Theravada monks. He stood in the grass and ruminated on Garibaldi. The disciples asked him questions like, “Who is the most overrated monarch in history?” The crowd was almost entirely male, and I remember some of the guys being disappointed, though not surprised, that no quirked-up cocquettecore girlies with bad politics were in attendance.\\n\\nLater, in the fall, I saw Yarvin debate the playwright Matthew Gasda on the Shakespeare authorship controversy at a smoky salon in Greenwich Village. If you’re not familiar with this ongoing argument, there’s an “Oxfordian” thesis that the 17th century aristocrat Edward de Vere was the true author of Shakespeare’s works, and that Shakespeare had actually just been De Vere’s rentboy. This was the position Yarvin was arguing; to him, there is simply no way that a lowly, common-born fellow like Shakespeare could ever have portrayed the machinations of aristocratic life so accurately. Gasda—a sort of earnest Belle and Sebastian conservative himself—was arguing the widely accepted “Stratfordian” position, and had studied all night so he was ready to defend the Bard’s honor. Yarvin’s approach was more flippant. “Suppose a corpus of witty, erudite academic novels, set in an unnamed Ivy League English department,” he posited, “is published under the name of an illiterate immigrant from Ghana, who sells sunglasses on a blanket on the street in Morningside Heights?”\\n\\nIt was a line that sounded familiar, because Yarvin had already published it in a blog on his Substack. Clearly, the Ghanaian immigrant analogy is his go-to line on this subject. In his closing arguments, he went on to suggest that De Vere couldn’t put his own name to his works of genius because he was part of an Elizabethan bohemia of poet-spies who ran psyops for the Queen. Whether the Oxfordian thesis is actually true isn’t so important to Yarvin. What is? Hyperstitioning alternate histories to sow disbelief in the institutions of liberal modernity, ideally in the flippant manner of a social media shitposter. And who better to lap up these myths than the chain-smoking Dimes Square beatniks in the audience?\\n\\n“The mainstream framing of Yarvin as the brains behind an imminent post-democratic America is one destined to fail, as it takes his bait on some level”\\n\\nIn the following years, I’d run into Yarvin every now and then at salons in other downtown basements. Sometime around Christmas 2023 I went to a reading where the venue hosts, fearing antifa-Dadaist direct action, had hired a bouncer to ensure the poet’s safety. In his signature winter look of all-black jeans and leather jacket, he read works from favorites like W.H. Auden, Robert Lowell, and Robinson Jeffers, as well as some original writing. I found one poem of his—“War”—particularly striking, for how it tried to channel the Futurist ecstasy of combat though the experience of looking at your phone:\\n\\n“I spend too much time\\n\\nOn Twitter, following\\n\\nThe war—probably\\n\\nOn the wrong side—\\n\\nNothing is in me to care”\\n\\nFrom there, the speaker in Yarvin’s poem—presumably Yarvin himself—is mesmerized in a kaleidoscope of disinterested transhistorical enjoyment. The angel of history goonscrolls reality, which in 2025 is a titillating and contextless succession of thirst traps and snuff videos from the front. We learn that war is full of paradoxes—war is pointless but it’s also the only eternal thing in human existence, (“all else fades from the clays”); it’s cool as hell; it’s the worst thing ever; it’s all a big lie, but lies are cool (“The highest art is propaganda” begins another of Yarvin’s poems)—no, it’s peace that is fake; peace disappoints; peace is unsexy; it’s the opposite of love. Of course, this ode to war was probably written in comfortable conditions in Northern California, but the author knows what he’s playing at. The intense traumatic-erotic experience of industrial slaughter is the libidinal origin of fascism, and seems to be a model for Yarvin’s New Right ideology of the future. Yet crucially, the intensity is lacking; these horrors are something the poet and his audience can mostly only experience vicariously, through the internet.\\n\\nCURTIS YARVIN IN DEFIANT MOOD IN HIS BELOVED NYC. PHOTO BY NICK DOVE.\\n\\nWhat my experiences in New York tell me is that the mainstream framing of Yarvin as the brains behind an imminent post-democratic America—even when intended as ridicule—is one destined to fail, as it takes his bait on some level, validating the idea of his real proximity to power. Even as Trump seems to be attempting some version of the RAGE (Retire All Government Employees) plan that Yarvin has laid out in his blogs, the actual writing is less a guidebook of practical decisions for the American Caesar than a word soup of dazzling lies intended to chip away at the received wisdom of liberal modernity itself.\\n\\nCase in point: When Yarvin suggests that the wellbeing of Black Americans actually declined after slavery, he’s not interested in a good-faith historical argument. What he seeks to do is undermine the idea that All Men Are Created Equal. He certainly doesn’t need to convince Trump of that one, and it’s not like what Yarvin has to say will be of any direct help in the administration’s coming attempts to destroy the Civil Rights Act. It’s the nativist faction, the intra-administration rivals of Yarvin’s benefactors, who have that covered.\\n\\nYarvin has a much different function. His dream is to win over the lookers-on: the College Republicans, the Silicon Valley elites, and in New York’s bars and smoke-filled salons the clouted “cool kids” who will one day be in positions of media power great enough to help rewrite history—and maybe let Yarvin fulfill his destiny as the great prophet of a new age of illiteracy, tyranny, and digital psychedelia.\\n\\nFollow Michael Crumplar @mcrumps'},\n",

       "   'content': 'If you’re old enough to remember the DARE program, you probably remember the litany of unhinged rhetoric they used to try and convince you that smoking cannabis was not a good time and does not make you a cool dude. Among those was the claim that over time, cannabis makes you dumber and permanently damages your long term memory. Well, we can (maybe) put that one to bed along with the whole “gateway drug” thing. Because according to a study out of Denmark, cannabis users might actually experience less cognitive decline than non-cannabis users as they age.\\n\\nConscripted In Copenhagen\\n\\nA little background first: Ever since 1849, Denmark has required physically fit men over 18 years of age to be conscripted for 4-12 months of military service. On the way into this service, conscripts are given a cognitive test. That’s where the authors of this new study saw an opportunity. The test was re-administered to 5,162 men who were now around 64 years old, and then polled those men to see if they’d ever tried or habitually consumed cannabis.\\n\\nVideos by VICE\\n\\nThe men who were habitual consumers of the devil’s lettuce actually scored higher on the cognitive test than those who didn’t, showing less overall cognitive decline over the around 44 year period between the first time they took the cognitive test and the re-test for this study. There are a lot of other factors that could play a role in these results, like lifestyle, income, and consumption of other intoxicants over time. But even accounting for those, the researchers still saw a slight uptick in cognitive function among the old stoner crowd.\\n\\nNot so fast, Grandpa\\n\\nThere’s a caveat, though. The margin is slim: cannabis consumers scored on average 1.3 points higher than non-cannabis users. Even the authors of the study say that much more research is needed before any medical conclusions can be drawn. Still, it’s an interesting result that flies in the face of conventional wisdom about cannabis. So don’t go getting your grandpa a bag of weed and a bong for Christmas just yet. Or do, just don’t expect that it’ll make him any better at, well, anything besides eating and saying inappropriate things at the dinner table.'},\n",

Cattle Country is taking up the reigns and heading to the prairies. Giving players a chance to live out their wildest Western dreams. While it’s easy to see that there are still some parts in development, the demo gives players a great taste of what they can expect. Think Stardew Valley, but much more condensed and easier to digest. That’s what Cattle Country is aiming for, and also features some fun new features that help it stand out from the crowd.\\n\\nScreenshot: Shaun Cichacki\\n\\nYes, ‘Cattle Country’ Has Fishing, and Yes, It’s Much Easier Than ‘Stardew Valley’\\n\\nWhile Cattle Country features adorably dumpy little character models, the environments are stunning to explore. They’re surprisingly reactive, and feature plenty of details to help bring this world to life. The lush greenery, combined with the beautiful aesthetic, helps Cattle Country stand out among the crowd. While it does feature all of the Cozy Game basics, such as chopping down trees, fishing, and everything in between, it’s been streamlined to make it much more accessible here. Yes, the first thing that I did was check out how the fishing minigame is. And I won’t apologize for that fact.\\n\\nVideos by VICE\\n\\nBut, unlike other games in the genre, there are a few parts about Cattle Country that stick out in my mind. It features hunting, mining, rodeos, and bandit battles. Things that you’d never typically find in your standard Cozy Game, and something that helps it feel like a bigger sum than its parts. But, while it’s adorable as hell to look at, things can go south rather quickly. It’s basically a more pixelated version of Red Dead Redemption 2 but with more house-building.\\n\\nThere are a few things I’d love to see before the final game releases, however. It already looks and feels incredibly polished, but I do hope that the ability to run a bit faster is added in later. I know that Cozy Games are meant to be taken slow, but sometimes, I like to go fast. Sure, I have a horse from the start. But I want to run in the wild, damn it. Otherwise? I’m ready to get into this one a bit more, partner. Yeehaw, and such.'},\n",

You can watch the film now at YouTube or in the player below.\\n\\nPlay video\\n\\nNow, here’s an interview about the interview, with VICE director Alexi Phillips.\\n\\nVICE: First of all, thanks for making this intensely depressing film for me to watch. I haven’t slept since.\\n\\nAlexi Phillips: No worries.\\n\\nHow did the Shell informer first get in touch?\\n\\nI can’t really disclose that.\\n\\nMost of what’s talked about is disconcerting. How does this stuff stay out of the news?\\n\\nMost of these spills happen in countries that don’t get much media attention. Every once in a while a massive event, like what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, makes the news but the fact that there are thousands of tiny spills every day is just seen as more of the status quo and not remarkable enough to be ‘breaking news.’\\n\\nI was assuming the dangers of oil production would primarily be posed to the environment, or to members of the public whose lands or waters are suddenly destroyed by a big spill. I wasn’t expecting to hear that people actually working for these companies would be losing their lives, too.\\n\\nYeah, they are working in highly pressurized environments, with extremely combustible liquid and gas, so the risk is inherent—especially when they’re working offshore. But the danger is exacerbated by the crazy demands to continue pumping large quantities of oil, with a focus on profits above everything else.\\n\\nWhat surprised you most about what the Shell informer had to say?\\n\\nSadly, I was not that surprised. In all honesty I think that was my big takeaway from the interview. There was nothing she could tell me about that industry that would shock me or that I couldn’t believe.\\n\\nWhat changes do you hope these big oil companies to make in the future?\\n\\nI hope they get more robustly regulated, as I think they have demonstrated they cannot be trusted with our future.\\n\\nWhat changes do you expect these big oil companies to make in the future?\\n\\nI expect that they will talk a big talk and walk a tiny walk.\\n\\nYou can watch the latest episode of Informer now at YouTube.\\n\\nWhen contacted for comment, Shell said: “Respect for human rights is fundamental to Shell’s core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people. Our approach is informed by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and is embedded into our existing framework, such as our Shell General Business Principles and our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct details how employees, contractors and anyone else acting on behalf of Shell must behave to live up to our business principles.”'},\n",

       "   'content': 'A TV show’s rating used to mean something. Sort of. Nielsen TV ratings were always an imperfect system. They were all based on relatively few households whose residents were often self-reporting their TV-watching habits.\\n\\nYet for all its faults, Nielsen garnered enough respect as a tool for measuring viewership that the fates of thousands of TV shows and ad buys over the years were decided by the numbers published by Nielsen. Its trustworthiness is now being thrown the question after the company was taken over by a private equity firm.\\n\\nVideos by VICE\\n\\nIf you’re unfamiliar, private equity firms are the devil. I already explained it in detail in an article about the recent demise of Party City, but I’ll repeat it: private equity firms buy companies through a process called a leveraged buyout which saddles the company with so much debt that the company essentially can’t do anything other than provide its most basic service. It can’t innovate and it can’t expand.\\n\\nSometimes (in the case of Party City, a discount party supplier) it can’t even afford to offer customers discounts on products. Because every single dime it makes has to go into paying off the debt, so why discount the product when you can just make it more expensive?\\n\\n(Party City also owned the biggest manufacturer of party supplies, so they had a monopoly on the whole system).\\n\\nThis is, essentially, a death sentence that eventually allows the private equity firm to throw its hands in the air and say, hey, we did the best we could to make this company profitable (they didn’t) but it just isn’t working. Guess we’ll have to strip it for parts and make a profit!\\n\\nThere’s No Way Of Knowing How Many People Are Watching Streaming Shows Or Movie Nowadays\\n\\nThat last part is the entire point of it all, and it’s what happening with the company that provides TV ratings. A private equity group led by an organization called Evergreen Coast Capital bought Nielsen back in 2022 and has been doing its private equity looting and plundering thing ever since—and all because Nielsen was struggling to find its footing in the streaming age.\\n\\nPeople don’t watch things the way they used to. Nielsen started looking like a dinosaur when streamers started to self-report their viewing numbers in ways that can be generously described as creative and un-generously described as lies.\\n\\nThe New York Times published an article detailing the varied absurd ways different streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon report their streaming numbers. The through line in all of this is that there is no through line. They all use different metrics, and those metrics change depending on the narrative the streamer is trying to push on a given day.\\n\\nAs the article points out, MrBeast’s Amazon show, according to Amazon, was viewed by “more than 50 million viewers globally,” which makes it sound like a smashing success. The numbers reported by third-party measurement groups, however, paint a picture of a show that “is not a hit—no matter what data you look at how you cut it—but it also is in a flop or a bomb, either.”\\n\\nIn short, nobody knows what the hell is going on anymore. Nobody knows how many people are watching anything, truly, and that’s exactly how the streamers want it. They get to create their own definitions of success that are constantly being rewritten to suit their own needs. It’s all to attract advertisers who, by now, should know that the numbers they’re being pitched are complete and total bullshit that don’t mean anything.\\n\\nBut with no regulatory agencies forcing streamers into reporting hard cold data instead of whatever recontextualizing of their numbers that makes every piece of shit they turn out to look like a worldwide phenomenon, this is just the world are going to have to live in.\\n\\nNielsen was imperfect, but for a while there it was a steady gold standard that seems comparably better than anything we have today. Now, sadly, it’s been swallowed up by money-hungry ultra-capitalists and it’s only used to check in on how many people watched the Super Bowl.'},\n",

       "   'title': 'Aisha Nyandoro Showed America What Happens When You Give Mothers Cash',\n",
       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': \"This profile is published as part of our TIME100 Next list, recognizing 100 emerging leaders from across the world who are shaping the future.\\n\\nIn 2017, Aisha Nyandoro came to a sobering realization. As founder and CEO of the nonprofit Springboard to Opportunities in Jackson, Miss., she was committed to helping lift families in local public housing into the next phase—a place of their own. But her organization wasn’t moving the needle. “We were doing everything, from after-school programs, work-training programs, mommy and me, reading programs, all of these different activities and services we were providing on site,” says Nyandoro, 45. “But we were not actually seeing families successfully transition out of affordable housing, and that was important to us, because that was important to the families.”\\n\\nSo her organization spent some time talking to the mothers and came up with a solution that was at once extremely simple and very complicated. These mothers needed cash. Not in the form of housing vouchers. Not in the form of credits that could be used at a grocery store. Not in the form of free health care. Just plain old moolah. Loot. Legal tender.\\n\\nMoney—the type that can be spent on anything—has been out of favor as a method of helping impoverished Americans. Mississippi has been so allergic to giving its citizens cash that Congress held hearings in September to understand how the state mismanaged federal funds for needy families. The year before Nyandoro came to her realization, fewer than 2% of Mississippi's low-income families who applied for welfare payments from the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program had been approved. Meanwhile money from that fund has been lavished on almost anything else, including a $5 million volleyball stadium, payments to sports celebrities, and boot-camp-style fitness programs. And Mississippi is not alone. “We got caught, but I don't believe that we are the only state that is using TANF funds erroneously,” says Nyandoro.\\n\\nIn 2018, Nyandoro founded the Magnolia Mother’s Trust, a fund that gave 20 mothers in Jackson $1,000 a month for a year. Any Black mother living in the housing complexes that Springboard served could apply; the first 20 recipients’ names were drawn out of a box. Nyandoro called each one personally. She physically signed each check, put it in an envelope, and gave it to recipients in time for Christmas.\\n\\nThis modest program was the first guaranteed-income project in the 21st century, and nobody knew quite what to expect. Not all of the mothers flourished—getting people out of poverty is rarely a linear process—but most did. They paid off debts, fixed cars, made sure everyone had enough to eat, enrolled their children in activities, invested in their own business, went back to school, and socked away what they could for the future. Most of all, they got to think about something besides bills. They had enough stability to plan.\\n\\nPhotograph by Lelanie Foster for TIME\\n\\nThis fall Magnolia will welcome its sixth set of mothers, this time numbering more than 100. These moms will also get a 529 educational savings account for each child with $1,000 deposited in it. So far the trust has directly helped more than 400 families, but more importantly, it has provided a proof of concept for how to administer such a cash-provision program. There are now 150 similar initiatives around America. The Magnolia Mother’s model was echoed in the expanded child-tax-credit payments that lifted millions of kids out of poverty during the pandemic. The idea has been championed by Vice President Kamala Harris, who has proposed a tax credit of $6,000 in the first year of an infant’s life followed by an annual credit of up to $3,600, and vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance, who has floated a tax credit of $5,000 per child annually. Even the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the agency that provides housing vouchers, is exploring the possibilities of cash.\\n\\n“I think of her as spurring the current momentum that has led to these thousand flowers blooming all over the country,” says University of Michigan professor of public policy Luke Shaefer, whose book $2 a Day, co-authored with Kathryn Edin, was also an influential work among advocates of cash assistance. “She was the first one to get it off the ground.”\\n\\nThe lift was considerable. Shaefer has found opposition to cash assistance to be a rare nonpartisan issue. Conservatives oppose it because they believe it’s expensive, disincentivizes work, and people will fritter it away. Progressives oppose it, he has noticed, because they feel like it might jeopardize funds for the work they’re doing in social services.\\n\\n“If we give people money, what will happen? I myself had that question,” says Natalie Foster, president and co-founder of the Economic Security Project and author of The Guarantee: Inside the Fight for America’s Next Economy. “The evidence made it very clear that people continue working. People are working incredibly hard in this economy just to get by, and a guaranteed income creates a bit more breathing room. Study after study after study has shown that to be true.”\\n\\nBut back in 2018, Nyandoro had a tough time getting donors to understand why her approach was important. Even worse, she kept running up against the narrative that poor Black mothers couldn’t be trusted with the flexibility of cash. “The amount of toxicity that, quite frankly, I had to take on just trying to help people understand what this work was was really probably one of the darkest times of my life,” she says. “It's when I truly realized how disconnected the majority of people are from people.” She made a last-ditch call to one of her existing Springboard donors (who does not wish to be named), who agreed to fund the pilot program.\\n\\nOne recipient that first year who particularly affected Nyandoro was a mother whose children had only met their grandfather on FaceTime because he lived in Pittsburgh. The mama—as Nyandoro calls the women she works with—used some of the cash to take her children to visit him on spring break. “She didn't fly, she didn't do anything luxurious like that,” recalls Nyandoro. “She just made sure that her car was in decent working order, and she drove to Pittsburgh so her kids could meet their grandfather for the first time. Seeing what that did for herself and her father and her kids, it just broke me.” In a later program, a mother used her first check to pay off her $300 debt at the local community college so she could resume the phlebotomy course she could not attend until her back fees were paid.\\n\\nAisha Nyandoro Lelanie Foster for TIME\\n\\nNyandoro was raised in Mississippi in a family rich in civic-mindedness. Her grandmother, L.C. Dorsey, the daughter of sharecroppers, left school to get married when she got pregnant at 17, but was drawn into the civil rights movement after she became friends with Fannie Lou Hamer. She helped start the first rural community health center in America, advocated for civil rights and prison reform, and served on President Jimmy Carter’s National Advisory Council on Economic Opportunity. She also resumed her education and went on to get a PhD in social work. Nyandoro’s mother was a social worker and her father an elder in the AME Church; community issues were frequent topics of discussion around the dinner table. “I always knew I’d work in advocacy, because of how I grew up,” says Nyandoro.\\n\\nToday, Black families have the second-highest poverty rate in the U.S., after only Native Americans, with 21.2% living below the poverty line. And 27% of Black families with single mothers live in poverty, according to Census Bureau data. Nevertheless, the hardy stereotype of the single Black mother as a welfare queen, living large on public benefits, still affects so much of the way government assistance is distributed. “Black mothers get demonized,” says Shaefer. “I think Aisha is really a big part of stopping that train and moving it in a different direction, in terms of a different vision of Black motherhood and a different vision of the safety net.”\\n\\nMothers who get assistance from Magnolia do not want to be on the program permanently. “Time and time again, our mamas tell us that one year is enough, because they really just use it as a year of breathing room, as a year of planning and being very strategic in how they go about doing their work,” says Nyandoro. “They also say they don't want to become dependent on it.”\\n\\nThe real difference between cash-assistance programs and aid that is tied to specific needs, such as housing vouchers, is the amount of agency recipients have. Giving out cash suggests that the donor believes the beneficiary knows how best to address her own needs. Nyandoro, who has now won a slew of awards and is in demand as an expert on anti-poverty initiatives, often talks about dignity, which to people with enough sounds like a luxury item, but to these women means something more profound–that they can be trusted, that they know what’s optimal for their families, and that they can make decisions without seeking anyone’s permission or approval.\\n\\n“We don't understand how simple poverty is, and we try to make it overcomplicated,” she says. “Poverty is really about a lack of financial resources and about systems that we have all allowed to be put in place because we all benefit from them. But the narrative we tell ourselves is that people are poor because they choose to be poor, and are making bad financial decisions, and if they made better financial decisions, they wouldn't be poor. This is not true.” With the work of Magnolia Mother’s Trust, Nyandoro has the receipts to prove it.\\n\\nHair and makeup by Carla Pressley\"},\n",

       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': 'WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is throwing out protections that shielded roughly half a million Haitians from deportation, meaning they would lose their work permits and could be eligible to be removed from the country by August.\\n\\nThe decision, announced Thursday, is part of a sweeping effort by the Trump administration to make good on campaign promises to carry out mass deportations and specifically to scale back the use of the Temporary Protected Status designation, which was widely expanded under the Biden administration to cover about 1 million immigrants.\\n\\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a news release that it was vacating a Biden administration decision to renew Temporary Protected Status—which gives people legal authority to be in the country but doesn’t provide a long-term path to citizenship—for Haitians.\\n\\nPeople with the protection are reliant on the government renewing their status when it expires. Critics, including Republicans and the Trump administration, have said that over time the renewal of the protection status becomes automatic, regardless of what is happening in the person’s home country.\\n\\n“For decades the TPS system has been exploited and abused,” Homeland Security said in the statement announcing the change. “For example, Haiti has been designated for TPS since 2010. The data shows each extension of the country’s TPS designation allowed more Haitian nationals, even those who entered the U.S. illegally, to qualify for legal protected status.”\\n\\nHomeland Security said an estimated 57,000 Haitians were eligible for TPS protections as of 2011, but by July of last year, that number had climbed to 520,694.\\n\\n“To send 500,000 people back to a country where there is such a high level of death, it is utterly inhumane,” said Tessa Petit, a Haitian American who works as executive director at the Florida Immigrant Coalition and who says Haiti meets all the requirements to qualify for protections. “We do hope that, because they said that they are going to revisit, that they put politics aside and put humanity first.”\\n\\nRead More: ‘There Will Be a Genocide.’ The Horror I Saw in Haiti\\n\\nFarah Larrieux, a 46-year-old Haitian who arrived in the U.S. in 2005 and has been protected by TPS since 2010, said the decision demonstrates that officials “don’t care about what is going on in Haiti.”\\n\\n“Nobody is safe in Haiti,” said Larrieux, owner of a small communications company in South Florida, where most Haitians in the U.S. live. “This is a disruption of people who have been in this country contributing so much. People have been giving their sweat, their life, the sacrifice to this country.”\\n\\nIt’s not immediately clear how quickly people could be deported once their protections expire. Some may apply for other types of protection, and there are logistical challenges to carrying out such large-scale deportations.\\n\\nRead More: What Are Sanctuary Cities and Why Is Trump Targeting Them?\\n\\nHaiti’s migration director, Jean Negot Bonheur Delva, said only 21 Haitians have been deported so far under the Trump administration, but he noted that the group had already been scheduled for deportation under Biden. There were a total of nine flights to Haiti in 2024, according to Witness at the Border, an advocacy group that tracks flight data.\\n\\nDelva cited worries about the strain of sending people back to a country still reeling from violence and where more than 1 million people are homeless because of gang violence.\\n\\n“It’s very sad that people who left Haiti to look for a better life elsewhere … will come back,” Delva said. “With the insecurity problem, the lack of resources, they will be miserable.”\\n\\nMore than 5,600 people were reported killed last year in Haiti, according to the U.N. And many of the displaced are living in overcrowded makeshift shelters including abandoned government buildings where rapes are becoming increasingly common.\\n\\nGangs control 85% of Haiti’s capital and have launched new attacks to seize control of even more territory. Recent massacres have claimed the lives of hundreds of civilians.\\n\\nDelva said Haiti’s government recently created a commission to help those deported.\\n\\n“They are children of Haiti. A mother must receive her children from wherever they are,” he said.\\n\\nCongress created TPS in 1990 to prevent deportations to countries suffering from natural disasters or civil strife, giving people authorization to work in increments of up to 18 months at a time.\\n\\nToward the end of the Biden administration, 1 million immigrants from 17 countries were protected by TPS, including people from Venezuela, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Afghanistan, Sudan, Ukraine and Lebanon.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has already moved to end the protections for Venezuelans.\\n\\nTwo nonprofit groups Thursday filed a lawsuit challenging that decision.\\n\\n—Associated Press journalists Evens Sanon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and Gisela Salomon in Miami contributed to this report.'},\n",

       "   'title': 'The Man Who Took On Big Tobacco Has a New Target: Sports Betting',\n",
       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': \"On a balmy December morning in Boston, Richard Daynard is sitting at his dining-room table watching a livestream on his laptop. “Pure. Horsesh-it,” he declares as a witness testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\\n\\nThe hearing has been called to discuss what seems to be becoming America’s new favorite pastime: throwing down bets on sports, 24/7. And what has set the bearded, bookish law professor off is a former gambling regulator from New Jersey’s use of a talking point favored by both the industry and the professional sports leagues: that the reason it’s so easy to wager on sports these days is this is what the American people want. To Daynard, president of the Public Health Advocacy Institute (PHAI) at Northeastern University’s law school, such language deflects from gambling’s heavy social toll. “This is consumer choice!” says Daynard, the sarcasm driving home his point. “This is freedom!”\\n\\nDaynard has been fighting big public-health battles for decades. He played a foundational role building landmark legal cases in the 1980s and ’90s against U.S. tobacco companies, which ultimately resulted in cigarette manufacturers’ agreeing to pay more than $200 billion in settlement funds to the states. Now, at 81, he is no less indignant about the way companies seem to put profits over customer well-being. His latest objective is curtailing the excesses of sports gambling. “We’re talking,” says Daynard, “about addiction.”\\n\\nAmericans bet an estimated $150 billion on sports in 2024, up 24% from the prior year, according to the American Gaming Association, and sports books kept some $14 billion of that, up 27%. State governments collected about $2.5 billion in sports-betting tax revenue in 2024, a 19% jump. Networks broadcast incessant advertising, featuring premium pitchmen like Kevin Hart, LeBron James, Peyton Manning, and Jamie Foxx, from gambling companies like DraftKings, FanDuel, and BetMGM.\\n\\nRead More: 2024 Athlete of the Year: Caitlin Clark\\n\\nBut America’s burgeoning love affair with sports gambling has come with costs. Calls to problem-gambling hotlines have spiked. Emerging research suggests that sports betting depletes investment accounts of already financially vulnerable households, increases bankruptcy risk, and even contributes to upticks in intimate-partner violence. “I am presently, or have recently been, treating divorces, breakups, estrangement from children, criminal charges, incarceration, loss of all savings, foreclosure of homes, end of careers, suicidal ideation, hospitalization for a suicide attempt,” says PHAI director of gambling policy Harry Levant, a former gambling addict who’s now a clinical gambling-disorder therapist and also testified at that December congressional hearing. “The deepest forms of despair.”\\n\\nDaynard argues that sports-betting operators, much like tobacco companies, have engineered their product to foster addiction, through the constant stream of bonuses, promotions, and opportunities to microbet—on the speed of the next pitch, on the rebound totals of a particular player, on who will score the next touchdown—on your phone during a sporting event. “You’re just pushing buttons,” says Daynard. “You’re just going after action.”\\n\\nHis approach to reining in the industry is twofold: litigation and legislation. In late 2023 PHAI filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of customers in Massachusetts accusing DraftKings, one of the biggest gambling operators in the U.S., of utilizing deceptive marketing practices. Last summer, a judge denied DraftKings’ motion to dismiss the case, allowing it to potentially advance to the discovery phase. Daynard’s team also helped Representative Paul Tonko, a New York Democrat, draft the SAFE Bet Act, a federal law that would ban sports-gambling advertising during live events, prohibit gambling operators from accepting more than five deposits from an individual in a 24-hour period, and eliminate the use of AI to track a bettor’s gambling habits for customized promotions.\\n\\n“Nobody’s had more experience with fighting addiction as a scholar and activist and thought leader,” says Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who as state attorney general in the 1990s worked with Daynard to file lawsuits against tobacco companies and introduced the SAFE Bet Act with Tonko. “He was a very powerfully articulate advocate at a time when there were not a lot of them, making our lawsuits credible.”\\n\\nAs he sips soup in the three-bedroom Back Bay apartment he’s lived in since 1974, Daynard seems energized by the challenge ahead. After all, he not only knows what it’s like to take on a deep-pocketed adversary, he also understands the impact he can have if he prevails: Over the past 30 years, the price of a pack of smokes has gone up more than 450%, thanks in large part to the 1998 settlement that requires tobacco manufacturers to compensate states as long as cigarettes are sold in the U.S. Big Tobacco has stopped advertising to kids. And cigarette sales have fallen 59% since the settlement.\\n\\n“People laughed at Dick Daynard in the ’70s and the ’80s because they thought his ideas about going after the tobacco industry were harebrained,” says Thomas Sobol, a Boston plaintiff attorney who worked on the litigation against Big Tobacco. “They were wrong. People should think twice before even questioning his foresight.”\\n\\nA New York City native whose father ran a clothing business and mother worked as a public-school administrator, Daynard developed a smoking aversion when he was 12. He was the youngest member of the ham-radio enthusiast group that would meet in the back room of a Manhattan tavern, and the space would grow so thick with smoke, he’d have to retreat to the bar to get away.\\n\\nRichard Alan Daynard, age 10, after receiving his amateur radio operator’s license. Richard operates his ham set in the bedroom of his home in the Bronx, New York, on May 27, 1954. Robert Kradin—AP\\n\\nAfter attending the Bronx High School of Science, which counts more alumni as Nobel Prize winners than any other secondary school in the world, Daynard went to Columbia, where he majored in philosophy. “I was a nice, bright Jewish kid from New York,” he says. “There are two things I could do in life. I didn’t like blood.”\\n\\nSo he was off to law school, at Harvard. He spent one summer working for a fancy Manhattan firm, drafting a brief on behalf of a marquee client, Ford Motor Co. But oiling the wheels of commerce wasn’t for him. “I’m sitting in my chair thinking about when I’m 50,” says Daynard. “What will my life be like? I’ve only got one of these things. What will I have to say for myself?”\\n\\nDaynard joined the Northeastern law faculty in 1969. (He also got a Ph.D. in urban studies and planning at MIT in 1980.) He started going to meetings for a quirky smoking-opposition group in the 1970s that, according to Daynard’s wife of close to 50 years, Carol, included a Boston landlord with a “huge” hat, a hermit who’d monitor TV transmission towers in Needham, Mass., and an MIT engineering professor who’d ride a recumbent bicycle throughout Boston. “It was sort of a weird combination,” she says. The couple’s son spread the anti-cigarette gospel: once, when he was about 6, he spotted a Boston motorcyclist lighting up and told the biker he shouldn’t do that. “My wife is watching him, feeling lucky that he didn’t get slugged,” says Daynard.\\n\\nIn 1983, Daynard became president of the Massachusetts chapter of the Group Against Smoking Pollution (GASP). While teaching a course on consumer protection, he solicited recommendations on what to do in his new gig. “This was a class of law students,” says Daynard. “So the answer was ‘Sue the bastards.’”\\n\\nRead More: How a Pair of WNBA Rivals Came Together to Create the Groundbreaking New 3x3 League 'Unrivaled'\\n\\nNaturally. But since the 1950s, that had been a failing strategy. Big Tobacco hadn’t lost a court case brought by an individual smoker or paid a penny in settlements or damages. Still, Daynard started the Tobacco Products Liability Project out of Northeastern; in 1985, the group published the inaugural Tobacco Products Litigation Reporter, devoting a portion of that first issue to documenting a case out of New Jersey in which Rose Cipollone, a smoker for 40 years, sued tobacco companies for causing her cancer. The case continued after her death in 1984, and Daynard began publicizing documents from the trial. He held a 1987 press conference to disclose a memo, written by a government doctor, saying that a tobacco-company lawyer admitted in a meeting with the U.S. surgeon general that cancer is linked to cigarettes. In 1988, Cipollone’s husband won the first-ever jury award ($400,000) involving the death of a smoker, though an appeals court later overturned it.\\n\\nTaking on tobacco sometimes stressed out his family. “I told him he couldn’t go south of D.C.,” says Carol. “I was worried about backlash from some crazy tobacco farmer.” She once accompanied him to a meeting in Chapel Hill, N.C., and they received a police escort. In 1990, Daynard flew to Orlando to meet with a mysterious character posing as a woman in written correspondence: Merrell Williams Jr. was a theater Ph.D. who, while working as a paralegal at the firm repping tobacco giant Brown & Williamson, stuffed damning internal documents into a girdle, ripping open a bag of chips as he passed a security guard to cover the sound of rustling papers. The whistle-blower told Daynard about the documents, which included an admission from a Brown & Williamson lawyer that the company was in the business of selling “an addictive drug.” They were eventually funneled to congressional lawmakers, who had just held hearings in which seven tobacco CEOs had said under oath that nicotine wasn’t addictive; a medical professor who disseminated them online; and the Mississippi attorney general, who with the assistance of Daynard and private litigators filed the first state lawsuit against Big Tobacco.\\n\\nDaynard introduced the theory of “unjust enrichment” into the proceedings. It posited that while tobacco companies were making money off smokers, the state had to pay medical costs for sick customers and was thus the injured party. Other states followed Mississippi’s lead, and within just a few years, an agreement was in place that would transform cigarette consumption in this country. “As a physician and public-health professor, we often don’t view lawyers as partners and leaders in promoting public health,” says Dr. Howard Koh of Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “But Dick has saved so many lives.”\\n\\nBettors check out the latest Super Bowl prop bets at the Imperial Palace sports book on Jan. 29, 1999, in Las Vegas. Jeff Scheid—AP\\n\\nFans watch Super Bowl 58 LVIII on screens at a sports book in Las Vegas on Feb. 11, 2024. Gregory Bull—AP\\n\\nDaynard isn’t a sports fan. He almost never gambles. He’s placed a few wagers at the horse track over the years, bought a lottery ticket once when the jackpot was a gazillion dollars, and while on a Caribbean cruise with Carol bet some 50 bucks in the casino (he came out $5 ahead). But Daynard can pinpoint exactly when sports gambling hit his radar: March 10, 2023, the day mobile betting commenced in Massachusetts. Just as smoke enveloped the back room of Forrester’s Bar and Grill during Daynard’s ham-radio confabs, sports-gambling advertisements blanketed even the trash cans of Boston.\\n\\nAs anyone who’s watched an iota of sports programming over the past few years can attest, the betting business doesn’t traffic in subtlety. Sports-gambling ads are everywhere. (Heck, I saw a DraftKings infomercial on AMC one recent morning. AMC!?) It’s somewhat hard to fathom that just about a dozen years ago, the major U.S. professional sports leagues sued to stop New Jersey’s effort to legalize sports betting, citing a 1992 federal law, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), that essentially prohibited sport betting outside of Nevada. The Supreme Court, however, in 2018 overturned PASPA, on states-rights’ grounds. Since then, 38 states and Washington, D.C., have legalized sports betting; mobile betting is permitted in all but eight of those jurisdictions. (Missouri voters approved sports betting in November, and gambling should go live there sometime this year.)\\n\\nPro sports leagues that had nominally been trying to stop gambling went all-in. This embrace makes business sense. Gambling increases product engagement: if you bet on baseball, you’re much more likely to consume baseball. Plus, gambling creates new direct revenue streams for the leagues, which can sell their real-time data to the companies, which in turn can create live in-game betting opportunities. Still, says sports-gambling researcher John Holden, a professor at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business, “the buy-in from the leagues exceeded many people’s wildest imaginations.”\\n\\nSuch robust championing of betting contributes to the downsides researchers have documented. More than a decade ago, gambling disorder was classified as the first nonsubstance behavioral addiction in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. A paper presented at a finance conference in October, titled “Gambling Away Stability: Sports Betting’s Impact on Vulnerable Households,” found that sports-betting legalization led to depletion of investment accounts while also increasing credit-card debt and the frequency in overdrafts for financially constrained households. Mark Johnson, a finance professor at BYU and one of the study’s co-authors, anticipated that sports gambling would replace other forms of entertainment. “That’s not happening,” says Johnson. “Instead, people are taking money that they had allocated for investments to fund betting. It’s concerning.”\\n\\nAnother October 2024 working paper, this one from researchers at UCLA and USC, estimates that online sports-betting legalization has led to roughly 30,000 additional annual bankruptcies and $8 billion in annual debt collections. A third paper from last year, from economics doctoral students at the University of Oregon, found that an NFL home-team upset loss in states with legalized sports gambling is more than twice as likely to lead to an incident of intimate partner violence, compared with states without legalized gambling.\\n\\nDespite such alarming findings, Daynard isn’t out to ban sports gambling. He also never aimed to stop smoking altogether. What he wants to change is the approach to policing the market. The industry touts the “responsible gaming” model, in which companies include problem-gambling hotline numbers in ads, much as labels are affixed to cigarette packages: you were warned, we’re offering help, so don’t blame us for your woes. A public-health strategy, on the other hand, recognizes that the product can be addictive and enacts reasonable measures to protect consumers. “People fall off the cliff,” says Daynard. “The ‘responsible gaming’ approach is, we are here with the ambulance. The public-health approach is, you put a fence up on the top.”\\n\\nDaynard happens to live a few blocks from DraftKings headquarters. Since way before the legalization of Massachusetts sports betting, he’s parked in the garage beneath the building that now houses the company’s offices. He jokes he should carry a picture of DraftKings CEO Jason Robins with him, to recognize the executive in a pinch. “I have this fantasy that if I’m not watching,” says Daynard, tongue firmly in cheek, “Jason Robins will be there with a bat.”\\n\\nPHAI’s lawsuit against DraftKings alleges that the company’s offer “to get a $1,000 deposit bonus” on the sign-up page of its mobile app, and a similar offer on its website, tricked Massachusetts customers who were new to sports betting into funding new accounts and engaging with a known addictive product. Unbeknownst to them, the suit alleges, the customers would receive a $1,000 bonus only if they deposited $5,000 up front, bet $25,000 within 90 days, and bet that money on games in which you had at least a 25% chance of losing your skin. And even if someone fulfilled those requirements—which were, according to the suit, spelled out in “unreadable” small print—the $1,000 wasn’t a cash bonus. It was a credit to be used for more gambling. “The old dope peddler actually hands over the stuff,” says Daynard. “These guys can’t hand over, to use a technical term, the f-cking $1,000. They’ve just hooked somebody. But they can’t give you a goddamn $1,000?”\\n\\nA pop-up party by mobile betting operator DraftKings at a bar near Hoboken Terminal, N.J., in September 2019. Brian Finke\\n\\nIn its argument for dismissal, DraftKings contended the promotion wasn’t misleading, and wrote that “no reasonable consumer would believe that a deposit of any amount would result in the immediate transfer to them of 1,000 U.S. dollars.” The company also claimed the plaintiffs failed to specify any financial harm caused by the promotion, as not receiving an expected bonus is not the same as losing money. Massachusetts Superior Court Judge Debra A. Squires-Lee, however, wrote that the extent of any DraftKings deception “must be developed in discovery,” and that the plaintiffs “plausibly suggest that they were harmed because they bought into a service worth less than they believed.”\\n\\nAs in most class actions, legal experts say, the odds seem stacked against the plaintiffs. “But the fact that this case has survived that motion to dismiss is fairly significant,” says Holden. “That doesn’t spell victory automatically. But it is a signal that hey, this isn’t a nothing.” If the case does proceed to trial, experts say, a jury could be turned off by the way DraftKings marketed its promotion offer to novice customers. “The lawsuit does a good job of saying, ‘Of course, you put it in your terms and conditions, but you don’t emphasize that,’” says Keith Miller, a professor at Drake Law School. “You don’t emphasize how much people have to deposit. What the play-through is. Those sorts of things are the hardest for them to defend.”\\n\\nTIME graphic\\n\\nLaw is like the NFL: a copycat operation. Innovations spread fast. As the Massachusetts suit progresses, lawyers in other states will file similar claims, just as they did in the tobacco wars. It’s already happening. In September, a suit similar to PHIA’s action was filed in New York; so far in 2025, DraftKings has been hit with lawsuits in New Jersey, Illinois, and Kentucky concerning its “no-sweat” and “risk-free” bet promotions.\\n\\n“DraftKings provides a legal and regulated platform that prioritizes integrity and responsible gaming,” a company spokesperson writes to TIME in a statement. “Our products are designed for fun and entertainment, giving players opportunities to follow their favorite teams and athletes while connecting with friends. We believe our promotional terms are clearly and fairly disclosed in plain language, and we fully adhere to the regulations set forth in each jurisdiction where we operate. We remain committed to resolving the matter in question through the legal process.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, the SAFE Bet Act— which would also ban such “bonus” and “no sweat” advertising, require that operators conduct customer affordability checks for wagers in excess of $1,000 in a 24-hour period or $10,000 in a 30-day period, and prohibit operators from accepting deposits via credit card—is also an underdog. After all, two Democrats are pushing for regulations in a Republican-controlled Congress. “I’m very clear-eyed that it will be an uphill fight,” says Blumenthal. “It will depend a lot on whether my Republican colleagues want to stand up to the industry and produce some decent reforms.” His Democratic colleagues, moreover, don’t count as no-sweat bets. “The power of the industry affects legislators on a bipartisan basis,” says Blumenthal. “To be very blunt, it’s not like Democrats are immune to campaign contributions and other forms of influence.”\\n\\nThrough it all, Daynard, who’s well past retirement age, plans to keep fighting. He works out with a trainer and says he’s in the best physical shape in his life. He’s still teaching at Northeastern while pursuing a public-health agenda. “I love being productive and useful,” he says. “I don’t play tennis. I don’t play golf. I don’t sail. There’s a limit to how much solitaire I can play. I haven’t learned how to play pickleball.” He’s promised to go part time if he makes it to 100.\\n\\n“One of the great upsides of being older is you’ve seen a lot of things,” says Daynard. “And you can recognize them. So you see something, you say, ‘Aha.’” Daynard snaps his finger. “What’s similar with the tobacco industry is that they’ve designed the trap. The customers are in there, and they extract whatever money they can from them. And what happens with a trapped customer? Nothing good.”\"},\n",

       "   'content': \"Walter Carpenter walks across the ski resort’s dining room on a knee that needs to be replaced and a hip that’s going bad. Lumbering into the kitchen, he deposits a brown bin of dirty dishes on a counter before heading back out to collect more bowls of half-eaten tomato soup and plates littered with sandwich crusts. “One foot in front of the other,” he jokes to kitchen prep worker Kim Hopper, 72, as they pass each other.\\n\\nCarpenter, 69, has worked winters at the Mad River Glen ski area in Waitsfield, Vt., for the past 15 years. Four times a week, he clocks in around noon, and makes $20 per hour carrying dishes up and down the three flights of stairs in the “base box,” as the kitchen and bar area is called, putting plastic food baskets and metal tongs and soup ladles in their rightful place, loading the industrial dishwasher with cups and bowls. He has peripheral neuropathy, which can leave him without feeling in his feet or legs. Some days, his phone tells him, he walks more than five miles during his shifts.\\n\\nHe never thought he’d be on the job at this age, but without much in retirement savings, Carpenter has no plans to stop. “I’m broke and poor and still working at 69,” he says as he once again ascends the carpeted gray stairs with a bin full of dishes, his shoulders slightly stooped, his gray mustache and hair hidden under a baseball cap, a scruffy Einstein with a slight Boston accent. “But at least I’m still here.”\\n\\nMad River Glen, where a daily adult lift ticket costs $115, couldn’t run without staffers like Carpenter. If you include part-timers on the ski patrol, the kitchen crew, and the employees at the retail shop, about half its workers are over 65, according to marketing coordinator Ry Young. That’s not entirely surprising in Vermont, where about 26% of residents 65 and older are still working—the highest share in the U.S. The state is at the forefront of a national trend: as birth rates decline and the country ages, older people are staying in the workforce longer. Today, about 19% of people 65 and older in the U.S. are still working, up from 10% four decades ago.\\n\\nKim Hopper, 72, works as a prep cook at Mad River Glen. John Tully for TIME\\n\\nThey do it for a variety of reasons. Some, like John Mandeville, 75, the executive director of the Central Vermont Council on Aging, find fulfillment from their jobs and want to keep going until they can’t anymore. Others, like Hopper, the prep cook, have ample retirement savings but still want to be around people, and work part time to stay connected. But about half of workers 65 and older are people like Carpenter, according to Craig Copeland, director of wealth-benefits research at the Employee Benefit Research Institute. For one reason or another—an illness, an investment scam, a lifetime of jobs without a pension or means to save for retirement—they have no choice but to keep working to pay the bills.\\n\\nFor these people, the finish line can feel miles away, and every time it draws closer, something moves it back again. Maybe they thought they could get by with their retirement savings until inflation started climbing. Or perhaps they were on track to quit at 65 until the stock market took a dive. Many are like Carpenter, who has worked for 55 years, doing construction, picking apples, running ski lifts, and managing parking lots, but can’t retire because most of his jobs were low-paying, with meager benefits.\\n\\nThere will likely be more of these Americans in the years to come. Half of babies born in the U.S. in 2007 are projected to live to 103, according to the World Economic Forum. As lifespans lengthen, wages are not keeping up with inflation, and even a decent nest egg may not go far enough. That’s especially true as employers have shifted the burden of retirement savings to employees, offering 401(k)s rather than pensions that promise a certain benefit every month. As a result, millions of Americans are going to have to keep working longer. “The issue more than anything is the high cost of living,” says Mandeville, the Council on Aging director. “It’s really strained people’s retirement budgets.”\\n\\nThe growing class of people who want to stop working, but can’t, represents a crack in a social compact that assured citizens who worked hard that they could take it easy when they hit 65, if not before. As that crack grows, it will put economic strain on younger generations who have to care for family members, contributing to a growing burden of debt that includes student loans and homeownership. Retirement savings will become one more discouraging thing that young workers can’t afford as their costs grow but their wages do not. Forty years ago, a teacher or a municipal worker or an employee on a manufacturing line was guaranteed a good retirement after putting their time in. Today, more people are working in service-industry jobs, but longtime workers like Walter Carpenter cannot afford retirement. “I just have to keep working,” he says as he clears away dirty dishes. “Right now, retirement is a distant dream.”\\n\\nIn the mornings, Carpenter sits down at a desk in his rent-subsidized apartment in downtown Montpelier and writes letters. He sends missives to newspaper editors about the need for single-payer health care, the problems with the private insurance market, and the importance of gun control. Evidence of his political advocacy adorns the otherwise bare walls of his spartan apartment. There’s a picture of him with Senator Bernie Sanders taken on the steps of the Vermont state capitol; a letter from former Senator Patrick Leahy; a commendation from former Governor Peter Shumlin. Carpenter spends hours sitting at his big desk, the main piece of furniture in his couchless living room, writing about the flaws of the American economy. “What will happen when, as a friend so aptly put it, I become ‘too frail to work and too poor to live?’” he wrote in one 2017 letter advocating for state-sponsored retirement benefits.\\n\\nCarpenter became a health care advocate in 2006, he says, after he became seriously ill from a liver disease caused by gallstones in the bile ducts. His health-insurance company wouldn’t preapprove blood work and radiology tests that were needed to figure out what was wrong, he recalls, forcing him to spend hours and hours on the phone with them, advocating for his own treatment. The illness forced him to take a 12-week absence from his job at Stowe Mountain Resort, which was owned by a different company than it is now. He’d worked there since 1995, in a series of jobs that had health insurance and a 401(k) and paid $10 to $12 per hour—not a huge sum, but well above a state minimum wage that sat at $7 at the time. But when Carpenter was ready to return to work, he says, the company had gone through a restructuring, and his job was gone. He applied for other full-time gigs with benefits, but no one seemed to want to hire a 52-year-old man with a history of health problems.\\n\\nWhen people lose good jobs in their 50s, it’s common for them to struggle in their 60s and in retirement, says Lisa Berkman, a professor of public policy and epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who has studied older workers. The 50s are a fork decade professionally, Berkman says. Around half of Americans are not working full time throughout them, and the odds of those people being able to find good jobs in their 60s are low. In contrast, about 80% of people who work full time through their 50s go on to work in their 60s. “When you get to be 60, all the inequality that has accumulated over your lifetime comes into Technicolor,” Berkman says.\\n\\nSo it has been for Carpenter. Since his illness, he has been a seasonal worker, spending winters at Mad River Glen and summers at Vermont’s Waterbury Center State Park, where he is a park attendant for $22 an hour. The pay isn’t bad, but the cost of living in Vermont is higher than the national average. Even with a rent-subsidized apartment, Carpenter’s finances are tight. There’s the $235 he has to pay monthly for his Medicare supplement, and the $184 deducted from Social Security for Medicare Part B, plus hundreds of dollars on groceries, his cell-phone bill, and expenses for his car, which he drives about 50 miles per day to get to and from work in the winter. The salt does a number on the undercarriage of his 2015 Subaru Forester. One year he had to dip into his retirement savings to get it in shape for its annual inspection.\\n\\nCarpenter’s situation may sound like bad luck, but it’s a reality for many older Americans. About 1 in 5 people over 50 have no retirement savings at all, according to the AARP. The problem is getting worse over time. A 2023 government survey found that 20% of low-income workers had a retirement-account balance in 2007, but only 10% had one in 2019.\\n\\nCarpenter has had a colorful life—a self-identified hippie, he’s studied the flute at the Berklee College of Music, taken trains across Canada, lived in Israel, and survived the eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington State. The hospitality industry found him when he moved back to the East Coast to care for his aging father, a professor, and started working odd jobs. This, too, is a common problem: as more people are thrust into caregiving for aging parents, they’ll either have to spend much-needed money for that care or scale back their own work, compromising their fragile finances even further.\\n\\nCarpenter sometimes wishes he’d thought about retirement earlier, back when he was traveling the world and working part-time jobs. It can be hard sometimes to go to events like his high school reunion and see old schoolmates who are retired and financially secure. He’s worried about what will happen over the next decade. That’s why he scrimps and saves now, eating the half-priced food at Mad River Glen whenever he can, subsisting on deli meat from the kitchen. “There’s going to be a time when I can’t do this anymore,” Carpenter says, wiping his hands on the dirty rag tucked into his pants. “So for now, I have to save as much as I can.”\\n\\nThe sun is setting at Mad River Glen one December evening, and the cafeteria is closing. Customers clomp across the vast dining room in their ski boots, ready to go home. In the kitchen, things are slowing down; workers mop the floor as a boom box blasts the Grateful Dead. Carpenter tosses a green bag of sopping compost into a bin, then bends over to pick up a black plastic bag filled with trash. “You have to know how to lift things in this job,” he says, gesturing to the rolling cart full of trash bags and compost.\\n\\nDonning his jacket, he rolls the cart to the elevator, takes it to the ground floor, and drags it outside. It’s about 10°, but Carpenter is cheerful as he hoists the trash, recycling, and compost, and tosses them in the proper bins. It is a job for a younger person. When it eventually becomes too difficult, he may ask to become a cashier like his colleague Ron Anderson, 81, who retired from a career in advertising decades ago, then decided to come back to work for camaraderie and the free lift ticket given to all employees.\\n\\nRon Anderson, 81, holds down a cashier's job at the Mad River Glen resort. John Tully for TIME\\n\\nAs the nation ages, workers like Carpenter and Anderson will play a greater role in the economy. The Census Bureau predicts that the 65-and-older population in the U.S. will leap from 58 million in 2022 to 82 million by 2050, when the group is projected to make up more than a quarter of the country’s population. The share of people in the workforce who are 55 and older is growing, while the proportion of people 16 to 54 has been shrinking since the late 1990s, according to a recent report by the Employee Benefit Research Institute. Older workers are becoming more prevalent as the youngest contributors to the economy—people 16 to 24—no longer work as often as they once did, instead pursuing school or other interests.\\n\\nWith its high proportion of older workers, Mad River Glen—and the state it serves—offer a glimpse of America’s future. Vermont is the third oldest state in the nation; the number of residents 65 and older has nearly doubled during the past two decades, according to the Vermont State Data Center. The cost of living deters some people from moving here and often sends locals in search of an exit. As employers report worker shortages, state officials are beginning to look for ways to support older workers willing to fill the gaps, says Mandeville, the 75-year-old Council on Aging director.\\n\\nThat’s how a business like the Trapp Family Lodge, a resort in Stowe, Vt., came to put out an ad in 2022 that targeted retirees: “Are you retired and looking for a part-time job to get you out of the house/make play money?” it asked. Bob Schwartz, the resort’s marketing director, said the idea came as management looked for the “low-hanging fruit to beef up our workforce.”\\n\\nFlexibility is one of the biggest demands from older workers, says Jena Trombly, director of human resources at the Clara Martin Center, a nonprofit mental-health facility in Vermont. The center has cobbled together a staff by hiring many older people for part-time jobs, agreeing to give them ample time off to travel or visit their grandkids. The center has kept on some longtime workers by allowing them to transfer from full time to part time, keeping their knowledge in the organization. “It’s a win-win all the way around,” she says.\\n\\nJapan is a good model for what America might look like if its workforce is increasingly made up of older people. About 80% of Japanese workers want to continue their jobs after retirement, according to the World Economic Forum, and about 1 in 4 people 65 and older were still working in 2022. The country has encouraged companies to help by employing older workers and raising the mandatory retirement age above 60. Technology helps too. Some companies have used robots to help elderly workers continue at jobs that their bodies might not otherwise be able to do.\\n\\nBut having everyone work longer isn’t the only option. A new type of savings plan spreading around the U.S. could help more people put aside money for retirement. Called an auto-IRA, the plan sets aside money from people’s paychecks, which it then invests in stocks and bonds. The program costs employers nothing; their only responsibility is to inform workers about it. “This means that people who, for the most part, never had a chance to save can do so,” says David John, a senior policy adviser to the AARP who helped invent the concept. Vermont passed a law allowing auto-IRAs in 2023, and 17 other states either have operational auto-IRAs or are putting plans in place. In some states, like California, almost all employers have to participate.\\n\\nThe program appears to be helping workers grow their retirement savings in the states where it’s already operational, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts. More than a million people have amassed more than $1 billion in assets through such plans since 2018, according to John. In one Pew survey, nearly two-thirds of low-wage workers participating in an auto-IRA plan in Illinois said they were satisfied with it.\\n\\nWalter Carpenter supports the idea. In one of his letter--writing campaigns in 2017, he penned a missive to the online publication VTDigger advocating for Vermont to support state-sponsored retirement plans. In the letter, Carpenter referred to himself as “someone who knows what it means to lose any hope of retirement through circumstances beyond my control.”\\n\\nEmployers in Vermont can now start offering this type of plan. But unfortunately, Carpenter is unable to avail himself of the benefits now. It’s too late for the contributions he’d make at this point to amount to much. He reflects on this as he sits in the basement staff dressing room at Mad River Glen, pulling off his apron, swapping his work boots for snow boots and his jeans and sweatshirt for something clean.\\n\\n“Someone who has worked for 55 years like me should be able to retire,” he says. Instead, he keeps going—one foot in front of the other. He’s cleaned the kitchen counters with dish soap, taken out the trash, and stacked chairs on tables. He’s ready to go home for the night. But he’ll be back tomorrow, and for many days after that.\"},\n",

       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': 'There is still no cure for Parkinson’s disease, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new deep brain stimulator that could benefit patients with the motor condition.\\n\\nOn Feb 24, the FDA approved Medtronic’s BrainSense Adaptive deep brain stimulation, a device that surgeons implant in patients’ chests with electrodes connecting to the brain. The system is programmed to respond to and manage abnormal brain signals that contribute to involuntary muscle movements in Parkinson’s, which previous deep brain stimulation systems could not do. The device represents the most personalized and responsive deep brain stimulator for the condition.\\n\\n“A deep brain stimulator is a brain pacemaker: similar to a cardiac pacemaker, except you insert electrodes in the brain to stimulate brain neurons,” says Dr. Helen Bronte-Stewart, professor of neurology, neurological sciences, and neurosurgery at Stanford University. Bronte-Stewart helped design the international, multi-center trial to test the device.\\n\\nHere\\'s what to know about deep brain stimulation for Parkinson\\'s disease.\\n\\nRefining an \"always on\" device\\n\\nDoctors have offered deep brain stimulation to Parkinson’s patients since 2002. But until now, devices have only provided continuous stimulation—not the dynamic and responsive activation that the current device does—and followed a one-size-fits-all model that was always “on” to activate the parts of the brain involved in motor function.\\n\\nContinuous stimulation causes a treatment imbalance for patients who are often also taking medications to control their involuntary muscle movements. Soon after a patient takes a dose, for example, the combination of the medications and deep brain stimulation could lead to overtreatment of their symptoms; once the medication wears off and before they take their next dose, they would likely be undertreated and have more severe tremors or abnormal muscle movements.\\n\\nRead More: A Potential Parkinson’s Treatment Has Promising Results\\n\\nThat\\'s because deep brain stimulation and Parkinson’s medications all target a specific arrhythmia in what experts call the beta pattern. But until recently, doctors didn’t understand much about the beta rhythm in the brains of Parkinson’s patients, including how it fluctuates over the course of a day or depending on what patients are doing. Recent studies have shown, for example, that arrhythmia in beta signaling decreases when people sleep.\\n\\nThe previous, continuous devices simply stimulate the signals for motor neurons, regardless of whether someone needs the stimulation at any given time or not. It\\'s analogous to putting someone on medication for high blood pressure without measuring the fluctuations in their blood pressure, says Bronte-Stewart. “It was on all the time and was the same for every patient, so it didn’t sense a person’s specific arrhythmia and didn’t adapt,” she says.\\n\\nA long road to a new approach\\n\\nThe new adaptive device is the result of decades of research into reading changes in brain signals relevant to Parkinson’s disease, and developing algorithms that can respond to those changes in real time. “Like cardiac pacing, we’ve written an algorithm that responds to when patients take medication, and modulates the beta rhythm to the stable range and stops it from going too high or too low,” says Bronte-Stewart. “Brain pacemakers are finally catching up to cardiac pacemakers.”\\n\\nThe advance also required finding ways to take the same measurements that doctors could collect in the operating room—when they would implant electrodes in the brain—but without repeated invasive procedures. Learning more about which signals and networks to target in Parkinson’s was necessary. “It was very important to spend years determining which signals were relevant to motor problems,” says Bronte-Stewart. “We had a way of measuring movement in humans in our labs that not many had.”\\n\\nThen came the task of encapsulating all of that activity in an implantable device that could safely live in the brain for years at a time, collect information, and adjust to nerve signals in real time. Data collected from patients with the original continuous devices provided a foundation for the new adaptive model. Continuous deep brain stimulation “really enabled us to get access to these patients’ brains that we wouldn’t have been able to access any other way,” says Scott Stanslaski, senior distinguished engineer at Medtronic who has been working on implantable devices for three decades. Stanslaski says those early devices made it possible to develop brain-sensing technology to read the signals zapping around the brain, and isolate which ones were critical for Parkinson’s. “There were a lot of epic fails in the early phases to figure out the sensing technology,” he says.\\n\\nA \"life-changing benefit\" for patients\\n\\nJohn Lipp was diagnosed with Parkinson’s just shy of his 50th birthday, after he noticed that his right hand and foot would involuntarily clench, making it difficult for him to walk without tripping. He took the standard Parkinson’s medications, which are the first line of treatment, but experienced severe anxiety and had to switch therapies. As his symptoms worsened, he and his doctors discussed deep brain stimulation, which is generally a last resort intervention since it involves risky brain surgery.\\n\\nLipp decided to receive the adaptive device, which Medtronic was still studying in research trials in 2021. He joined the trial Bronte-Steward was running. “I noticed a change almost immediately,” Lipp says. “My most problematic symptom was dystonia, or muscle cramping, which was both painful at times and debilitating.\" But after surgery, \"my dystonia pretty much went away. That, to me, is the most significant, life-changing benefit.\"\\n\\nThe new device has also allowed him to reduce his Parkinson\\'s medications from 14 or 15 a day to four, he says.\\n\\nRead More: Michael J. Fox: Chasing Parkinson\\'s Treatments\\n\\nLipp says the device has quelled almost all of his symptoms. The only time he’s reminded of them is during his regular visits to Bronte-Stewart for check-ups, when the doctors briefly turn the device off. “My body kind of collapses,” he says. “I feel a change in my muscle tone, and my ability to sit up straight; it’s like I’m pulled into my center of gravity. So I know it’s working.”\\n\\nBronte-Stewart stresses that the device does not slow the progression of Parkinson’s, but it can help patients to live more comfortably with their symptoms.\\n\\nFor now, the device Lipp and others will receive can remain in their brains for about 15 years, and doctors can replace the battery as needed in an outpatient procedure. Lipp is also reassured that having the device won’t exclude him from taking advantage of any new treatment or potential cure for the disease, should these be developed. “Let’s say some miracle cure comes along; I can always have the device removed. That offers me a sense of security,” he says.\\n\\nLipp credits the advice with making it possible for him to travel with his husband and even run marathons. He ran the New York City Marathon last year, and plans to do it again this year. Before getting the device, “I thought my running days were over because of my rapidly developing symptoms,” he says. “The fact that I can still do [marathons] is great.”'},\n",

       "   'content': 'The Baltic Express: Central Europe\\'s new hop-on hop-off train\\n\\n6 hours ago Tristan Rutherford\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\nThe Baltic Express bursts out of the Czech capital on a crisp winter morning. As the sky lightens, medieval Prague is streamed through the train\\'s windows like a Netflix trailer. From armchair seats in private compartments, a city of Rococo castles and wide boulevards appears: the \"Paris of the East\", mostly unscathed by Nazi occupation in the 1940s or socialist planning in the 70s. Moments later the train hums through a timeless Czech countryside. Onion-domed churches and frozen fishing lakes scroll past as the train sprints north.\\n\\nThe recently launched route from Prague to Gdynia on Poland\\'s Baltic coast operates four times daily, and takes travellers directly into Central Europe\\'s most vibrant and less-touristed cities that were previously tricky to get to. It will entice international travellers who want to combine a city break with a rural experience, followed by a holiday on the beach.\\n\\nThe term \"Baltic Express\" is an ambitious misnomer. Think of this new 878km connection not as one of the speedy plane-killer routes trending in recent years – like London to Amsterdam or Istanbul to Ankara – custom-built to compete with budget airlines. Instead, the eight-hour trip promises a scenic history tour through overlapping empires via some of the Czech Republic and Poland\\'s most buzzing cities, including Gdansk and Poznan. Best of all, this highly affordable and experiential journey allows passengers to hop-on and hop-off wherever they choose.\\n\\nMy own journey started in Prague\\'s Hlavní Nádraží station. From outside, the terminus looks like a cathedral to train travel with twin cupolas rising from its roof like Roman temples. The station was built in 1871 when the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which ruled Central Europe, laid train tracks around the empire as a way of weaving all trade and security through the empire\\'s capital of Vienna.\\n\\nAlamy Look up to spot soaring domes and Romanesque statues in the Art Nouveau section of Prague’s Nádraží Hlavní station (Credit: Alamy)\\n\\nInside the station, Nádraží Hlavní\\'s main departure hall was decorated when the Czech Republic was part of the Soviet Empire and is a socialist rainbow of primary colours. Yet unbeknown to most passengers, one floor above sits an original waiting room styled in Art Nouveau, while a soaring dome in this higher level overlooks Romanesque statues and polished brass rails. In 2024, the fancy Foyer Café opened in an adjoining salon, serving Czech riesling and viennoiserie pastries high above the hoi polloi. It\\'s a fine way to start a continental meander.\\n\\nAfter just one hour aboard the Baltic Express, I make my first hop-off stop at Pardubice. The 100,000-person city exudes Czech charm. The old town square is Prague-esque, with church steeples shaped like space rockets and townhouses coloured every shade of pastel. Pardubice\\'s Austro-Hungarian townhouses are as fancily familiar as in every empire city: Sarajevo, Brno, Lviv. Yet I can count that day\\'s tourists on one hand.\\n\\nTrain Journeys Train Journeys is a BBC Travel series that celebrates the world\\'s most interesting train rides and inspires readers to travel overland.\\n\\nIronically, statues in Pardubice commemorate the birthplace of Czech aviator Jan Kašpar. In 1911, Kašpar flew south from Pardubice to Prague, following the railway tracks now used by the Baltic Express. The mechanical efficiency of aviation has competed with the romanticism of rail ever since.\\n\\nI rejoin the Baltic Express an hour before sunset. The topography rises towards the Polish border in an undulating green sheen. First oak woods, feral deer and icy streams. Then pine forests, hunting lodges and deep snows as the train climbs into the quickening night. As Europe has become borderless, only a choral chirp from passengers\\' cellular networks welcomes our train to Poland.\\n\\nČeské dráhy Passengers can hop on and off the Baltic Express to explore towns and cities along the route (Credit: České dráhy)\\n\\nI share my seating cabin with a woman named Marta Kortas who works in Gdansk\\'s data analytics industry. \"The train has made a new connection for me because I have friends in Prague and southern Poland,\" she tells me. The region of rural Silesia flashes past in the dark, where passengers can get off for thermal springs and salt mines. Kortas lived here during Covid lockdown. \"I even dreamt I could move back and use the train to commute to my office a few days per month. Direct connections between Prague, Wroclaw and Poznan makes that dream much easier.\"\\n\\nAround 20:00, I alight, alongside Polish business commuters, to spend the night in Wroclaw, Poland\\'s historical third city. For nearly a century before 1945, Wroclaw was the German-speaking city of Breslau, and its Teutonic-Gothic train station was designed by a Prussian architect. After World War Two, however, Poland\\'s borders shifted west and the train station formerly known as Breslau Hauptbahnhof was renamed Wroclaw Glowny – although direct services still run to Berlin on tracks laid by the German Empire more than a century ago.\\n\\nI wake up to Wroclaw\\'s whirling snow and reboard the Baltic Express for the third time, strolling along the length of the eight-carriage train to gauge the passenger make-up. There are bike racks and bench tables, a dining car and coffee bar, occupied by everyone from Polish grannies to Czech work-from-homers. It\\'s the mix anticipated by Jan Hrabáček of Czech national rail operator České Dráhy, whom I speak to en route.\\n\\n\"We already have a connection from Prague to Budapest and Warsaw,\" says Hrabáček, who helped develop the Baltic Express route. \"So the idea of the Czech and Polish transport ministers was to connect the quickest possible route from Prague and Wroclaw to the sea.\" Tourism, not business, will be the key summer driver: Czechs used to drive south to Croatia for holidays, says Hrabáček, but now it\\'s expensive. \"Czech people \\'found\\' Poland as a destination because the beaches are great and the weather has become warmer.\"\\n\\nAlamy Leszno is a beautiful medieval city in western Poland that\\'s often overlooked by travellers (Credit: Alamy)\\n\\nThe joy of the Baltic Express is that it affords a few hours in destinations one might otherwise overlook, like the Czech spa town of Kłodzko or Poland\\'s medieval city of Leszno. I make my penultimate pitstop in Poznan, a Polish cultural capital that has an old town square as pretty as any imagined in a Disney fairytale.\\n\\nI start in the square\\'s Military Museum, where rakish Napoleonic tunics and dashing air force costumes – Polish soldiers knew how to dress – tell of a darker story. Poland has only enjoyed 50 years of independence in the last two centuries due to Austro-Hungarian, Nazi and Soviet occupiers, which makes the safeguarding of the country\\'s culture during difficult times even more impressive.\\n\\nPlan your journey The Baltic Express stops at more than 20 exciting destinations, including two Unesco World Heritage sites. Break up the journey be spending a night or two in a charming Central European city en route or stop off for a few hours of sightseeing or lunch in one of the smaller towns – then jump back on the four-times-daily service. Book individual tickets via the Czech or Polish national train operator websites. Alternatively, an Interrail pass offers unlimited hop-on hop-off travel.\\n\\nFor example, the interiors of the Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help look like a darkly atmospheric Vatican with a ceiling as kaleidoscopically intricate as a Fabergé egg. I learn that the Nazis turned the basilica into a warehouse before it was restored after World War Two. Meanwhile, Poznan\\'s magnificent brick brewery, Stary Browar, a city in itself, was mothballed during the Soviet era. It has been reborn as a cultural space and shopping hub near the train station.\\n\\nAt lunchtime, I embark on my final leg towards Gdansk. As a board the train, a conductor I met the day before gives me a nod of welcome. The Baltic Express is starting to feel like home.\\n\\nThe cosiest space is the dining car. A chef grills fresh gołąbki (pork-stuffed cabbage leaves), her assistant spoons out pumpkin barley with kale and the waiter decants bottles of Łomża beer. The train catering company WARS holds a special place in Polish hearts, having catered on international rail routes from Irkutsk to Istanbul since 1948. It\\'s a long way from a British Rail sandwich.\\n\\nGetty Images One of the last stops on the route, Gdansk is packed with history (Credit: Getty Images)\\n\\nA fellow diner is marketing consultant Karolina Paszkiewicz. \"The trains Poland had 10 years ago were slow and cold,\" she recalls. The train to Gdansk, where Paszkiewicz\\'s clients are based, used to take nine hours from her hometown of Wroclaw. \"Today it\\'s four and half,\" smiles Paszkiewicz, as she munches on a Polish apple pie. \"After you\\'ve eaten and opened your laptop, it\\'s time to get off.\"\\n\\nWe\\'re nearly at the end of the line. Outside, the landscape freezes and flattens. A whirl of seagulls intimates that we\\'re descending towards the sea. The natural port of Gdansk has been Poland\\'s window on the world for seven centuries. As a member of the Hanseatic trading league, the port city exported goods around the Baltic Sea between Hamburg, Riga, Bergen and Bremen. Visible from our slowing train are handsome wharf houses where beeswax, amber and furs could be winched up from passing ships.\\n\\nIn Gdansk, history is inescapable. The train terminal is a mirror of Colmar station in France\\'s Alsace region, both designed by German architects when Imperial Germany governed these parts. The city\\'s Museum of the Second World War shares how the first shots of one of Earth\\'s greatest conflicts were fired right here. Finally, the European Solidarity Centre highlights Gdansk\\'s shipworkers\\' role in helping to bring down Soviet communism decades later.\\n\\nWhat makes the Baltic Express special is its sense of interconnectedness. It\\'s a Czech-Polish train, travelling on tracks laid by Austrians and Germans that offers the freedom to eat, sleep and explore en route. Experiential train travel has a new destination.\\n\\n--\\n\\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can\\'t-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.'},\n",

       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': 'Why a mega river-linking plan has sparked massive protests in India\\n\\n17 hours ago Vishnukant Tiwari BBC Hindi\\n\\nBBC Protesters say the project will destory their homes and livlihoods\\n\\nThousands of villagers in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh are protesting against a multi-million-dollar river-linking project which, they say, will rob them of their homes and livelihoods. The Ken-Betwa project, with a budget of 440bn rupees ($5.06bn; £4.05bn), will channel excess water from the Ken river in Madhya Pradesh to the Betwa river in the neighbouring Uttar Pradesh state through a network of tunnels, canals and a dam. It is the first of 16 such river-linking projects earmarked under India\\'s National Perspective Plan for water resource development in the 1980s. The plan faced multiple delays - mainly due to environmental concerns and political disputes - before the government cleared it in 2021. Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for its construction in December last year. The project is supposed to help the drought-prone Bundelkhand region - which includes parts of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh - where arid climate and unpredictable rainfall patterns have led to decades of poverty and underdevelopment. The government says that once completed in 2030, it will help irrigate 1.06 million hectares of land, provide drinking water to 6.2 million people and generate 130MW of hydropower and solar energy. But at least 10 villages, including vast swathes of precious forest land, will be submerged to build the dam\\'s reservoir and 11 more villages will be displaced for constructing the canal, affecting more than 7,000 families, district officials say. \"Our livelihoods are tied to this land - we don\\'t know what the future holds for us anymore,\" said Tulsi Adivasi, who is among the thousands of villagers protesting against the project. Most of them belong to the indigenous Gond and Kol tribes, who live along the edge of forests and depend on farming for a living.\\n\\nAt least 21 villages, mostly inhabited by tribespeople, will be submerged by the project\\n\\nEnvironmental experts warn the project will submerge nearly 98 sq km (38 sq miles) of the Panna Tiger Reserve, a 543 sq km sanctuary that successfully brought tigers back from local extinction in 2009. This could undo years of conservation efforts. \"It\\'s unprecedented. We have never seen a core area of a national park being used for such a large-scale infrastructure project before,\" says environmentalist Amit Bhatnagar. In 2019, a panel of experts constituted by India\\'s top court had also raised concerns about the project, questioning its economic viability and impact on the region\\'s wildlife. The government, it said, should explore alternative irrigation methods in the river basin. Independent studies on river-linking projects in India have made similar observations. A 2023 study published in the Nature Communications journal states that such endeavours \"may worsen the water stress across the country, making these projects ineffective or possibly even counterproductive\". Baleshwar Thakur, who heads the National Water Development Agency, however, defended the project, saying authorities had conducted a thorough research and acquired all environmental clearances for the project. \"We have also designated additional land to offset the loss of tiger habitats and will rehabilitate other species affected by the project as well,\" he said. The government official admitted that there would be a potential \"challenge\" to the biodiversity of the region, but said that \"the benefits of the project outweigh the adverse impacts\".\\n\\nThousands of villagers have been protesting against the project since December\\n\\nThe assurances have done little to comfort the villagers. In the heart of Daudhan, 48-year-old Mahesh Adivasi sat with a group of men, who voiced their dissent in the form of a protest song. \"Ken-Betwa dam is built by the government, it gives others water but drowns us,\" they sang, the lyrics capturing their anguish. The village is one of the poorest areas in the region, lacking basic facilities such as clean drinking water and electricity. The bitter irony of the river project isn\\'t lost on its people - they ask why they are being asked to abandon their homes to provide electricity in 13 other districts when their own village has never had power. \"We have seen generations pass without progress. Now, we are being asked to sacrifice our lives for others\\' progress. What about us?\" Mahesh Adivasi said. The government has offered villagers an optional compensation plan, where they can either opt for a piece of land along with 750,000 rupees ($8,655; £6,842) or a one-time payout of 1,250,000 rupees. For those who own land, an additional amount based on the land\\'s value will also be given.\\n\\nAnxious locals say they live in perpetual uncertainity about when they\\'d be asked to relocate'},\n",

       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': 'Is the downfall of a Japanese star a turning point for women\\'s rights?\\n\\n19 hours ago Shaimaa Khalil Tokyo correspondent\\n\\nAP Masahiro Nakai announced his retirement in January\\n\\nFor months, Japan\\'s entertainment industry has been rocked by a scandal that unseated one of its most popular celebrities and put one of its biggest broadcasters at risk. But some believe it has also marked a turning point in how cases of sexual assault are perceived in Japan - where traditionally victims have been shamed into silence. At its heart was Masahiro Nakai, a household name and leading presenter for Fuji TV, one of the country\\'s biggest broadcasters. Nakai, who is also a former member of J-pop boy band SMAP, was accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a dinner party in 2023. The revelations, which appeared last December in the weekly tabloid magazine Josei Seven and were then picked up by the Shukan Bunshun, marked the latest of a series of scandals involving celebrities in Japan, including that of late entertainment mogul Johnny Kitagawa, who was found by investigators to have abused hundreds of boys and young men over six decades. Nakai didn\\'t admit guilt and denied using force against the woman. But he apologised for \"causing trouble\" in a statement and said that he had \"resolved\" the matter in a settlement, reportedly worth more than half a million dollars.\\n\\nBut as public anger mounted, he was forced to announce his retirement from the entertainment industry in January. Another channel, the Tokyo Broadcasting System, has also stopped airing a program that Nakai regularly appeared on as an MC. The impact on Fuji TV has been devastating. The broadcaster\\'s reputation is now in ruins. Its revenue is under threat and some of its top executives have also been forced to step down. High-profile companies like Nissan and Toyota were among those who pulled advertising from the broadcaster as outrage grew. Fuji TV has since admitted it allowed Nakai to continue presenting shows even after finding out about the allegations.\\n\\n\\'Keep silent to keep your job\\'\\n\\n\"If this had happened 10 years ago, there would not have been this outcry,\" Keiko Kojima, who worked in Japan\\'s media industry for 15 years as a TV presenter, told the BBC. Sexual violence against women is one of Japan\\'s worst-kept secrets. A 2020 survey claimed that more than 70% of sexual assaults in the country go unreported. And according to a 2024 study published in the International Journal of Asian Studies, for every 1,000 rapes in Japan, only 10–20 result in a criminal conviction – and fewer than half of convicted rapists are incarcerated. \"There\\'s still a prevalent attitude of \\'Shoganai \\' or \\'there\\'s nothing you can do\\' that is being projected on women - so they\\'re encouraged to keep silent,\" Machiko Osawa, professor emeritus at Japan Women\\'s University in Tokyo, told the BBC. She added that women were seldom believed and did not have proper mechanisms to even report such incidents, which contributed to this culture of silence. Ms Kojima said that the media industry, in particular, has long had a culture of impunity and lack of accountability where many young women felt they must keep silent to keep their jobs. \"It was common for men to make rude comments about women\\'s bodies or appearance or age. I remember my colleagues and I being asked how many people we\\'ve had sex with,\" she said. \"We were expected to reply with a sense of humour without getting angry or offended. I saw sexual harassment and other forms of derogatory treatment of women on a daily basis. For a woman, adapting to these situations was the only way to become a full-fledged TV or media professional.\"\\n\\nKeiko Kojima Keiko Kojima who worked in Japan\\'s media industry for 15 years, says women had to put up with sexual harassment to keep their jobs\\n\\nThe Fuji TV case has also raised questions about dinners and drinking parties involving celebrities and young women - and how common they were. Although Shukan Bunshun retracted an earlier report that claimed the alleged assault took place at a party organised by Fuji TV, Ms Kojima told the BBC that it was indeed common to use women as \"tools for entertaining\". \"In Japanese working culture, it\\'s an everyday practice to half-forcibly take young female employees to events to entertain clients,\" she said. \"Men are happy when young women join them. The idea that women are like a gift and that taking a young woman with you is a way of offering hospitality to the other person is very common.\" That is why the fallout from this scandal has encouraged women\\'s rights activists. Minori Kitahara, one of the founders of the Flower Demo movement - where groups of sexual violence survivors and their supporters gather in public spaces on the 11th of every month - admitted she was surprised at how swiftly and severely the sponsors reacted. \"Even if it\\'s more of self-preservation than human rights for sponsors, this is a turning point for the MeToo movement in Japan,\" she told the BBC. \"It\\'s up to us how big we make it.\"\\n\\nDeeper in disgrace\\n\\nNearly 50 companies have walked away from the now-tarnished Fuji TV. The Japanese government has also withdrawn all its recent and planned advertisements with the network. And it has called on the broadcaster to regain the trust of viewers and sponsors. So far Fuji TV seems to have done neither. The scandal and Fuji TV\\'s role in hiding it have sent the company on a crisis-management frenzy that seems to have led to deeper disgrace, fuelling even more public anger. Fuji TV president Koichi Minato admitted that the company had known about the allegation shortly after the alleged incident. But he said they chose not to disclose it at the time because they \"prioritised the woman\\'s physical and mental recovery as well as the protection of her privacy.\"\\n\\nGetty Images Masahiro Nakai was accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a party in 2023\\n\\nAfter a press conference held in the hope of defusing the outrage turned into a PR disaster, the company held a second one that lasted 10 hours. It was intended to show remorse. Both Fuji TV\\'s chairman Shuji Kano and its President Koichi Minato stepped down, bowing humbly as they announced their resignations. The firm said its executive vice-president Kenji Shimizu would replace Mr Minato as president.

       "   'content': 'NZ minister resigns after he \\'placed hand\\' on staff\\'s arm\\n\\nAndrew Bayly is the first minister to resign in Prime Minister Christopher Luxon\\'s administration\\n\\nHis resignation comes after he was criticised last October for calling a winery worker a \"loser\"- including putting his fingers in an \\'L\\' shape on his forehead - and allegedly using an expletive directed at them. He later issued a public apology.\\n\\nBayly said on Monday that he was \"deeply sorry\" about the incident, which he described as not an argument but an \"animated discussion\".\\n\\nNew Zealand\\'s commerce minister Andrew Bayly has resigned as a government minister after he \"placed a hand\" on a staff member\\'s upper arm last week, in what he described as \"overbearing\" behaviour.\\n\\n\"As many of you know, I have been impatient to drive change in my ministerial portfolios,\" Bayly said in a statement announcing his resignation.\\n\\n\"Last week I had an animated discussion with a staff member about work. I took the discussion too far, and I placed a hand on their upper arm, which was inappropriate.\"\\n\\nHe said a complaint had been made but would not elaborate further on exactly what had happened.\\n\\nBayly resigned last Friday, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon later told a press conference, adding that the incident happened three days earlier, on 18 February.\\n\\nLuxon said on Monday the government\\'s handling the issue within a week was \"pretty quick\" and \"pretty impressive\". He denied that he should have asked Bayly to step down following October\\'s winery incident, and said \"never say never\" when asked if there was a way back for the 63-year-old into another cabinet position.\\n\\nHowever, Labour leader Chris Hipkins criticised Luxon as being \"incredibly weak\", saying the incident with the staff member should not have been dragged over the weekend.\\n\\n\"Christopher Luxon has once again set the bar for ministerial behaviour so low, that it would be almost impossible not to get over it,\" he told reporters on Monday.\\n\\nBayly himself said that he had to talk to his family and \"would have had difficulty\" speaking to the media earlier.\\n\\nHe was first elected to the New Zealand Parliament in 2014 as an MP for the current ruling National Party. He was appointed the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, Minister for Small Business and Manufacturing, and Minister of Statistics following Luxon\\'s election in late 2023.\\n\\nHe was also appointed minister for the ACC - the national accidental injury compensation scheme - following a cabinet reshuffle earlier this year. Before joining politics, Bayly worked in the finance industry.\\n\\nLuxon said Scott Simpson, National\\'s senior whip, would take over the ACC and Commerce and Consumer Affairs portfolios.\\n\\nBayly is the first minister to resign of his own accord under PM Luxon, whose favourability has dipped considerably, according to recent polls. Both the 1News-Verian poll and the Post/Freshwater Strategy poll show his National-led coalition government is losing support among voters.\\n\\nThe government has recently come under fire for some policies that were seen by some as anti-Māori, including the introduction of a bill that many argued undermined Māori rights and the dissolution of the Māori Health Authority - which was set up under the last Labour government to try and create greater health equality.'},\n",

       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': 'At a recent Nevada legislative committee hearing, lawmakers faced off with members of the governor\\'s administration over how to fill gaping holes in the state\\'s upcoming budget.\\n\\nAt issue: whether opioid settlement money — paid by health care companies that were sued for fueling the opioid crisis and meant to help states abate addiction — should be funneled to two counties for a safety net program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which is aimed at helping low-income children and families.\\n\\nPrevious funding \"will no longer be available after June 30, 2025,\" the budget proposal says. By then, billions of dollars in covid-era relief from the federal government — including a set-aside for TANF, which can cover emergency aid, job training, child care, and more — is likely to have expired.\\n\\nRecognizing both the need for and uptake of this assistance, Gov. Joe Lombardo\\'s budget proposal directs $5 million in opioid settlement cash to shore up the program in the state\\'s most populous counties, Clark and Washoe.\\n\\nThe prospect of such tradeoffs is smacking many states in the face as they embark on budget season.\\n\\nNot only is the river of federal pandemic relief that flowed to public health, education, food assistance, child care, and more over the past few years drying up, but a deluge of actions from the Trump administration has thrown into question once-reliable federal funding for a myriad of social services and health care programs. Congressional Republicans have also threatened cuts to Medicaid, a joint federal and state health insurance program for many low-income people.\\n\\nTogether, these financial headwinds have left many states hunting for alternative funds to maintain crucial services.\\n\\nOpioid settlement money can seem like an attractive option. More than $10 billion has landed in state and local government coffers in recent years and billions more are set to arrive over the next decade-plus.\\n\\nBut recovery advocates, family members who have lost loved ones to addiction, and legal experts say that money has a specific purpose: to address the ongoing addiction and overdose crisis.\\n\\nEven if $5 million is a small portion of the hundreds of millions Nevada has received, some say spending it elsewhere sets a troubling precedent. Nevada Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, a Democrat, raised this concern at the February hearing.\\n\\n\"There doesn\\'t seem to be a direct link to opioids\" in the governor\\'s proposal directing these dollars to TANF, he said. Settlement money should not be used \"to backfill budget accounts.\"\\n\\nRichard Whitley, director of the state\\'s Department of Health and Human Services, insisted at the hearing that this was an appropriate use of settlement dollars. The money flowing through TANF will help \"relatives who are raising children whose parents are substance-abusing,\" he said.\\n\\nIn addition, Elizabeth Ray, a spokesperson for the Republican governor, told KFF Health News that the money would help families at risk of losing custody of their children due to substance use, with the goal of keeping kids in their homes and \"ultimately reducing the need for foster care placements.\" Implementing this program through the state\\'s TANF system would \"reduce start-up costs and implementation time,\" she wrote in a statement.\\n\\nBut TANF is available to many families living in poverty and it was unclear how these dollars would be targeted to such a subset.\\n\\nSimilar budget conflicts have surfaced in Connecticut — whose Democratic governor, the CT Mirror reports, is asking lawmakers to redirect opioid settlement money to social services that were previously funded through other means, including federal dollars — and Arizona, whose legislature transferred $115 million in settlement money to the state prison system last year to help close a $1.4 billion budget deficit.\\n\\nNational recovery advocate Ryan Hampton expects to see more efforts like this nationwide.\\n\\n\"I have a very high level of fear that states are going to be tapping into these settlement dollars in every creative way they can to fill some of these budget shortfalls,\" he said. \"It\\'s a grave misuse of funds and one that is going to have dire consequences.\"\\n\\nAlthough national overdose deaths have declined recently, tens of thousands of Americans are still dying from overdoses each year. In a few states, including Nevada, such deaths increased in the 12 months leading up to September.\\n\\n\"The intent of these dollars is to save lives right now,\" said Hampton, who is in recovery from opioid addiction and founded a Nevada-based recovery advocacy organization. He submitted a public comment opposing the Nevada governor\\'s budget proposal.\\n\\nHampton and other advocates worry that using opioid funds for services that, even if crucial, are only tangentially related to addiction risks a repeat of the tobacco settlement of the 1990s.\\n\\nAt that time, cigarette manufacturers agreed to pay state governments billions of dollars annually. Initially, states spent a chunk of that money on anti-smoking programs, said Meg Riordan, a vice president of research at the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, which tracks states\\' spending on tobacco prevention programs.\\n\\nBut over time, states encountered budget crunches and many raided or dissolved trust funds they\\'d set up to protect tobacco money. Instead, they funneled the cash directly into their general funds and spent it on infrastructure projects and budget shortfalls.\\n\\n\"Once the funds start going somewhere else, there\\'s a risk that they won\\'t come back,\" Riordan said.\\n\\nTobacco use remains a leading cause of preventable death in America.\\n\\nThe opioid settlements have more guardrails than the tobacco settlement did, but KFF Health News\\' multiyear investigation found lax oversight and enforcement.\\n\\nNevada and Connecticut are among 13 states that have explicitly restricted the practice of supplantation, or using opioid settlement funds to replace existing funding streams.\\n\\nWhitley, Nevada\\'s DHHS director, and the governor\\'s office have insisted that none of their proposed uses of settlement funds are examples of supplanting.\\n\\nAt the February hearing, Whitley repeatedly suggested that the budget proposal was misworded, creating a false impression. \"We\\'ll clean that up with the language,\" he said.\\n\\nBut he also emphasized the importance of settlement dollars as federal funding sources diminish. \"As ARPA [the American Rescue Plan Act] goes away and other flexible funding goes away to address problems, this becomes one that really we have to rely on,\" he said.\\n\\nThat perspective seems reasonable to JK Costello, director of behavioral health consulting for the Steadman Group, a company that he said is helping about a dozen local governments across the country administer the settlements.\\n\\nIdeally settlement money adds to existing services, he said, but realistically, some safety net programs, even if they don\\'t directly address addiction, can be a lifeline for people with opioid use disorder. If major cuts in federal spending imperil those programs, using settlement funds to save them could be worthwhile.\\n\\n\"Getting people into great treatment when their housing voucher is cut isn\\'t really that helpful,\" Costello said. \"Treatment isn\\'t going to work if they\\'re not able to eat or feed their kids.\"\\n\\nThe tricky thing is that many community organizations that work directly on addiction and recovery issues are also feeling the crunch of expiring federal aid and expected federal program changes that would reduce their resources, Costello said. When everyone is strapped, deciding where limited settlement dollars can do the most good becomes increasingly challenging.\\n\\nSome places presciently set aside opioid settlement funds in \"emergency\" or \"sustainability\" accounts that could be tapped for addiction services in case of declining federal aid. South Dakota has such a fund with more than $836,000, according to its 2024 opioid report. None of it has been used yet.\\n\\nKristen Pendergrass, vice president of state policy for the addiction-focused nonprofit Shatterproof, hopes states turn to rainy day funds first, before raiding settlement accounts.\\n\\nNevada has $1.23 billion in its rainy day fund, more than the national median, according to The Pew Charitable Trusts.\\n\\n\"It would be a slippery slope if we stop paying attention now\" and allow settlement funds to be used for anything, Pendergrass said. \"The money was won to remediate harms and save lives. It should be used that way.\"\\n\\nKFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.'},\n",

He said it fails to consider the nuances of traditional African beliefs.\\n\\n\"Traditional Zambian societies and individuals believe in a strong relationship between the human world and the supernatural,\" Moyo said.\\n\\nThe trial also has a heavy dose of political intrigue. Prosecutors allege the two men were hired by a brother of Emmanuel Banda — a former lawmaker who is now on the run — to curse President Hakainde Hichilema.\\n\\nSome have dismissed it as a stunt by Hichilema, who faces an election next year. The president hasn\\'t commented on the case.\\n\\n\"Will the court allow witch doctors and other alleged witches to testify as expert witnesses?\" a column in the Lusaka Times newspaper asked with scorn.\\n\\nBut some politicians and other public figures in Zambia have said they believe in witchcraft, seeking out supernatural help to make them stronger or more popular.\\n\\nZambia President Hakainde Hichilema speaks during the Lobito Corridor Trans-Africa Summit at the Carrinho food processing factory near Lobito, Angola, on Dec. 4, 2024. Ben Curtis / AP\\n\\nHichilema himself was accused of using witchcraft as an opposition leader by the late President Michael Sata, who asserted that the magic from his home region was stronger. Hichilema didn\\'t respond to that accusation more than a decade ago.\\n\\nA bottled chameleon, white powder and red cloth\\n\\nPolice say the men in the current case were arrested in a hotel room in the capital, Lusaka, in December after a cleaner reported hearing strange noises. They were found in possession of a bottled chameleon and other items including a mysterious white powder, a red cloth and an unidentified animal\\'s tail. The men also face charges of cruelty to animals.\\n\\nPolice said one man confessed they had been hired for a curse to kill Hichilema. He testified in court they were promised more than $1 million.\\n\\nThe case has captured attention because many Zambians take witchcraft seriously, said Enoch Ngoma, a journalist for more than 30 years who has covered many such trials.\\n\\nZambia\\'s judiciary had said it would allow this trial to be broadcast live on television, which would have been just the second time that\\'s happened for a trial. But it reversed the decision, citing \"stakeholders.\" Zambia\\'s influential Council of Churches had said it was opposed to a live broadcast.\\n\\nWhen the trial opened last week, the courtroom was packed.\\n\\nMany traditional beliefs have survived in Zambia alongside its official Christian religion. A study by the Zambia Law Development Commission, which has a mandate to reform laws, found that 79% of Zambians believed in the existence of witchcraft as of 2018.\\n\\nThe study was conducted because the Witchcraft Act has been questioned.\\n\\nIt was passed in 1914 when Zambia was part of the British \"sphere of influence.\" The act defines practicing witchcraft as pretending to exercise any kind of supernatural power, witchcraft, sorcery or enchantment calculated to cause fear, annoyance or injury.\\n\\nWitchcraft cases have been difficult to prosecute in Zambia, with evidence tricky to collect. The cases are normally heard in traditional courts, and this is a rare one to reach the magistrates court in Lusaka. The penalty for practicing witchcraft is a fine or up to two years in jail, with the possibility of hard labor.\\n\\n\"It is so difficult to prove witchcraft\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, protecting against witchcraft can be good business.\\n\\nRodwell Vongo, who goes by the name Dr. Vongo, is a traditional healer and president of the Zambian Traditional Healers Association. He said he would be referred to as a witch doctor under the law but calls that term derogatory.\\n\\nHe lives in a plush suburb of Lusaka and said he has a long list of middle-class clients, rejecting the presumption that such beliefs are only held by rural folk.\\n\\nThe majority of his customers are women who seek charms and spells for happy marriages, he said, but many others come looking for protection against witchcraft.\\n\\nWisdom Kaunda, a teacher, said he was closely following the witchcraft trial and believes it can help determine how his country treats the subject in the future.\\n\\n\"Personally, I feel people should be punished for planning to cause harm to someone,\" he said, but added: \"It is so difficult to prove witchcraft in the courts of law.\"\\n\\nBelief in witchcraft is also common in some rural communities in neighboring Angola despite strong opposition from the church in the predominantly Catholic former Portuguese colony. Last year, police said about 50 people died in Angola after being forced to drink an herbal potion to prove they were not sorcerers.\\n\\nIn 2013, Bishop Firmino David of Sumbe Diocese in Angola told ACI Africa that socio-economic challenges in the country are forcing some to \"resort to the practice of witchcraft because they believe that with witchcraft, they can get what they want and thus free themselves from poverty and get everything they need to survive.\"\\n\\nDuring a 2009 trip to Angola, Pope Benedict urged Catholics to shun witchcraft and sorcery.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'In the weeks since President Trump\\'s inauguration, there\\'s been a purge of staff, with both firings and resignations. Mr. Trump, who in his inaugural address said the scales of justice would be rebalanced, has said his administration is cleaning up a Justice Department corrupted by politics. Former acting attorney general under President George W. Bush, Peter Keisler, sees it differently.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think anyone who\\'s been watching the last four weeks could say they are taking politics out of the law enforcement process,\" he said. \"Quite the contrary. They are engaging in the very politicization and weaponization that they claim to be trying to eliminate.\"\\n\\nDuring her confirmation hearing, Attorney General Pam Bondi, President Trump\\'s new leader of the Justice Department, said she had no plans to politicize the office.\\n\\nTrump\\'s history with the Justice Department\\n\\nMr. Trump was the subject of Justice Department investigations in recent years during the Biden administration.\\n\\nMr. Trump\\'s Attorney General Pam Bondi, who declined a 60 Minutes request for an interview, launched a review to scrutinize those in the Justice Department who were involved in prosecutions of Mr. Trump, including his indictment in the 2020 election case, and his indictment related to allegations he hid classified documents in his Mar-a-Lago estate.\\n\\nThose cases were dropped after Mr. Trump won the 2024 election. The prosecution was brought by Jack Smith, who resigned as special counsel before Mr. Trump returned to the White House.\\n\\nAfter consultation with the Justice Department\\'s Office of Legal Counsel, Smith said that \"the department\\'s position is that the Constitution requires that this case be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated.\"\\n\\nThe Justice Department during Trump\\'s second term\\n\\nOne of Mr. Trump\\'s first actions after returning to the White House was the pardon of about 1,500 people in connection with the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. The pardon proclamation called the January 6 prosecutions, \"a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years and begins a process of national reconciliation.\"\\n\\nNot long after the ink was dry, letters of termination hit the Justice Department. The letters rewrote history, and echoed the words of the president, calling the Jan. 6 cases \"a grave national injustice.\"\\n\\nSara Levine and Sean Brennan were federal prosecutors on the Justice Department\\'s biggest investigation — the attack on the Capitol — until they were fired by the Trump administration on Jan. 31. They had both been hired about a year and a half ago to prosecute cases from the riot.\\n\\nSara Levine and Sean Brennan 60 Minutes\\n\\nWhile fear has silenced many in the department, Levine and Brennan chose to speak up.\\n\\n\"The Justice Department is under attack. They\\'re coming after the people that want to uphold the laws that exist. And that should be terrifying to everyone,\" Levine said.\\n\\nKeisler, who served as acting attorney general in 2007 under then-President George Bush, said the pardons send a message.\\n\\n\"It says that you can commit some very serious crimes, but if you do so as an identifiable supporter of the president\\'s agenda and political interests, you may be able to get off,\" Keisler said. \"And I think it was designed to send that message.\"\\n\\nThat message also hit the FBI when Mr. Trump\\'s acting deputy attorney general, Emil Bove, demanded the names of FBI personnel who had tracked down the Capitol rioters in 50 states. He also directed the firing of eight of the FBI\\'s senior career executives.\\n\\n\"I do not believe that the current leadership of the Justice Department can trust these FBI employees to assist in implementing the President\\'s agenda faithfully,\" Bove, who declined an interview with 60 Minutes, wrote of the FBI executives last month.\\n\\nKeisler said it is not the job of the FBI to implement the president\\'s agenda.\\n\\n\"Both the FBI and the larger Justice Department, of which it\\'s a part of, owe their duty to the law,\" Keisler said.\\n\\nDo presidents always clean house?\\n\\nWhat\\'s happening now isn\\'t business as usual with a new president in the White House, Keisler said.\\n\\n\"This is really unprecedented and it\\'s important to understand why,\" Keisler said. \"Political appointees get removed and replaced by presidents all the time. This is the top layer of leadership. But beneath them in the core of the government are the civil servants. These are people who have developed expertise over often decades of experience working across administrations of both parties. And whose jobs are protected by civil service laws that have been on the books since the late 19th century.\"\\n\\nPeter Keisler 60 Minutes\\n\\nKeisler was a Republican until Mr. Trump\\'s first term, when he switched to independent.\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s true that I\\'ve never voted for Donald Trump. My concern about the use of law enforcement to achieve political ends, that\\'s among the reasons I\\'ve never voted for President Trump. But at the end of the day, people can support whatever candidate they want. I would hope that nearly everybody would agree as a basic matter that our criminal justice system shouldn\\'t be used as a tool of politics to reward friends and punish personal enemies.\"\\n\\nIs the Justice Department being used to reward people?\\n\\nThe appearance of \"rewarding friends\" has triggered the biggest rupture so far. It involves a bribery indictment against New York City Mayor Eric Adams — a charge Adams denies. Though he\\'s a Democrat, Adams agreed to help Trump\\'s deportation effort. This month, Bove ordered New York prosecutors to drop the bribery prosecution of Adams, in part, so that Adams could \"devote full attention\" to \"illegal immigration and violent crime.\"\\n\\n\"The directive to drop the charges against Mayor Adams was one of the most nakedly political documents out of the Justice Department I\\'ve ever seen,\" Keisler said. \"If Mayor Adams had instead been an opponent of the president\\'s immigration agenda, then he would\\'ve been prosecuted. But because he says he wants to help advance the president\\'s immigration agenda, he doesn\\'t get prosecuted.\"\\n\\nBove\\'s order triggered resignations. Danielle Sassoon, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, resigned. She refused to sign a motion to dismiss the case because it was, in her words, for \"no other reason than to influence Adams\\'s mayoral decision-making.\"\\n\\nBove shot back, writing, \"you have also strained, unsuccessfully, to suggest that some kind of quid pro quo arises from my directive. This is false.\"\\n\\nBut a second Manhattan prosecutor, Hagan Scotten, also quit, telling Bove in a letter he would have to find someone who is \"enough of a fool, or enough of a coward\" to sign the motion. When Bove ordered prosecutors in Washington to sign the motion, six more resigned, bringing the total number of resignations to eight.\\n\\n\"[The resignations are] a flashing red light. Nobody gives up these jobs easily,\" Keisler said. \"But people have resigned because they are being otherwise commanded to perform unethical acts that they think are contrary to their responsibilities.\"\\n\\nThis past week, Bove explained his motion to dismiss to a federal judge. There is no decision yet.\\n\\nIs the justice system in trouble?\\n\\nKeisler believes the justice system is in trouble.\\n\\n\"I think when you have a major political corruption prosecution dismissed because somebody has agreed to become a political ally of the president, you know, that tripwire has already been tripped,\" he said.\\n\\nFor Levine, the fired prosecutor, the U.S. is \"teetering on the edge.\"\\n\\nSpeaking up was not an easy decision for Levine or her fellow fired prosecutor, Brennan. But in the end, they believe silence may be the greatest threat to justice.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think I could live with myself if I didn\\'t at least try to help people understand why what we\\'ve seen happening in the Department of Justice over the past few weeks is so critical and why it not only puts all Americans individually at risk,\" Brennan said. \"It really puts our constitutional governmental structure at risk.\"'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-24T00:00:00',\n",
       "   'content': 'CNN —\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump swept into office with a three-word energy policy: Drill baby drill. In Trump’s telling, unleashing US oil drilling will reduce gas prices – and thereby Americans’ cost of living – and increase the nation’s energy independence.\\n\\nBut there is a very simple reason why Trump’s seemingly simple plans don’t add up: Not all oil is the same.\\n\\nOil falls on a spectrum from light to heavy, depending on how much sulfur it contains. The recent shale revolution – with new fracking methods extracting more oil from Texas, New Mexico and North Dakota – has pushed the US to become the biggest oil producer in the world. It’s also generating an expensive, light crude oil that’s being exported to the tune of 13 million barrels per day.\\n\\nOil experts call it “the champagne of crudes.”\\n\\nBut that is not the kind of oil that has powered cars and industry in the US for decades. America was built on a thick, gunky crude that comes from other countries including Canada, Saudi Arabia and Central and South American nations.\\n\\n“All crude is not the same,” said Bob McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group. “Some crudes are like coffee grounds – they’re gunky, awful, viscous, dirty. Some crudes are like champagne, light and un-sulfurous.”\\n\\nThe US pumps a lot of home-grown champagne out of the ground; a full 80% of the oil produced here is light crude, according to the Energy Information Administration.\\n\\n“It’s much lighter and sweeter,” said Hugh Daigle, an associate professor at the University of Texas Austin and an oil expert. “It’s less viscous.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, the US uses a lot of “coffee-ground” oil. The nation imports around 6.5 million barrels of crude oil a day from others — most of it either heavy- or medium-density. By far the biggest source of US oil imports is its northern neighbor, Canada, which sent 1.42 billion barrels of crude oil to America in 2023.\\n\\nMost Canadian oil comes from Alberta’s tar sands region, where the oil looks like asphalt, molasses or coffee grounds. It’s the reliance on Canada’s crude that’s triggering fears of higher gas prices if Trump follows through on his threat to implement a 10% tariff on Canadian energy.\\n\\nTrump recently claimed the US could get along just fine without Canadian oil.\\n\\n“We don’t need their oil and gas; we have more than anybody,” Trump said at the World Economic Forum last month.\\n\\nA White House spokesman, Kush Desai, said in a statement that Trump is using “every lever of executive power to deliver progress on border security” including the “threat of tariffs that disproportionately affect Canadian oil producers — who are landlocked and reliant on exporting to the United States via pipelines.”\\n\\nBut US oil refineries could also be impacted by those tariffs.\\n\\nMany US refineries – some of which have been around since the 1930s or earlier – were built decades before America’s light-oil boom and therefore made to handle the heavy crude they first imported from the Middle East and South America – the same type of crude that Canada now produces.\\n\\nRefining US light oil is much simpler because it already has low sulfur content. McNally likens it to putting it “through a still like you’re making hooch in a hollow in West Virginia.”\\n\\nSome US refineries have adapted to refine the country’s light, home-grown oil, though it varies by region and geography. For instance, Gulf Coast refineries process mostly domestic oil because they’re relatively close to the Permian basin in Texas and New Mexico. Meanwhile, refineries in Midwestern and Western states are heavily reliant on Canadian oil because it’s also relatively nearby.\\n\\nThe other factors refineries need to consider are the price of crude oil (dirtier and heavier crude is cheaper than lighter), and the end products the refineries are making – everything from gasoline for cars, jet fuel, propane and asphalt.\\n\\nThere’s a lot that goes into oil companies’ business calculations, said Jenna Delaney, a Rapidan Energy Group analyst focusing on global crude.\\n\\n“It’s complex, it’s regionally specific and it’s a lot more complicated than saying, ‘we produce this crude, we should use all of it and not export any of it,’” Delaney said.\\n\\nTrump’s idea to use only US oil is simply not realistic, experts told CNN. Doing so would throw US refineries into turmoil, and gas prices could skyrocket as a result.\\n\\n“We’ll be importing Canadian oil for the foreseeable future, as far as I’m concerned,” Daigle said.'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-24T00:00:00',\n",
       "   'content': 'Washington CNN —\\n\\nThe CIA is conducting a formal review to assess any potential damage from an unclassified email sent to the White House in early February that identified for possible layoffs some officers by first name and last initial and could’ve exposed the roles of people working undercover, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.\\n\\nThat’s just one of multiple aftershocks from President Donald Trump’s push to take a jackhammer to the federal government – including the CIA. The administration’s efforts to cut the workforce and audit spending at the CIA and elsewhere threaten to jeopardize some of the government’s most sensitive work, current and former US officials familiar with internal deliberations say.\\n\\nAcross the river in Washington, a senior career Treasury Department official delivered a memo warning Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that granting a 25-year-old computer engineer with Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency access to the government’s ultra-sensitive payments system risked exposing highly classified CIA payments that flow through it.\\n\\nAnd on the CIA’s 7th floor — home to top leadership — some officers are also quietly discussing how mass firings and the buyouts already offered to staff risk creating a group of disgruntled former employees who might be motivated to take what they know to a foreign intelligence service.\\n\\nTaken together, those actions highlight the depth of unease among career officials that Trump’s efforts to speedily slim down the US government may be putting American secrets within the grasp of foreign spies and hackers.\\n\\n‘The position is now burned’\\n\\nIn an effort to comply with an executive order to downsize the federal workforce, the CIA earlier this month sent the White House an extraordinarily unusual email listing all new hires that have been with the agency for two years or less — a list that included CIA officers who were preparing to operate under cover — over an unclassified email server.\\n\\nThe agency is now considering whether some of the employees listed in the email to the White House who were previously slated for covert deployments in sensitive locations overseas should now be held back or reassigned, sources familiar with the matter said, because the risk that their identity may have been exposed to foreign government hackers is too high.\\n\\nThere is also a concern that some US embassy positions that are actually filled by CIA officers under cover may now be at risk of being revealed — potentially angering the host nation and exposing companies or endangering CIA assets who are known to have met with past occupants of the role.\\n\\nThe internal review — known as a damage assessment — will almost certainly assess not only whether individual officers are now at risk if they go to their intended posting, but whether the positions themselves have been compromised and can no longer be filled by agency officers going forward, former intelligence officials said.\\n\\n“Your predecessor was in that position, as were the five officers before them. Now the host country and adversaries know this person going to this position in the embassy is agency,” said one former CIA officer, speaking hypothetically. “They now assume the predecessors were the same [and] work backwards and find out their collective footprint.”\\n\\n“The position is now burned.”\\n\\nFired employees create security risks\\n\\nMeanwhile, as the CIA weighs staff cuts, current and former intelligence officials say that mass firings could offer a rich recruitment opportunity for foreign intelligence services — like China or Russia — who may seek to exploit financially vulnerable or resentful former employees. The Justice Department has charged multiple former military and intelligence officials for providing US intelligence to China in recent years.\\n\\nThe agency has already fired more than 20 officers for their work on diversity issues, many of whom are now challenging their dismissal in court. The government has said in court filings that it is still weighing additional cuts to comply with Trump’s order to end all diversity work across the federal government. And sources say that career officials at the agency are also working on recommendations about which probationary staff whose names were emailed to the White House should be dismissed. A final number has yet to be determined, one of these people said. None have been accused of misconduct or fired for cause.\\n\\nBut, unlike most other fired federal employees, all of those people have had access to classified information about the agency’s operations and tradecraft.\\n\\n“Terminating someone who works for Department of Agriculture — even if they’re disgruntled, if they’re not accessing classified information, what’s the risk?” one US official said.\\n\\nThe seal of the Central Intelligence Agency is shown at the entrance of the CIA headquarters in McLean, Virginia, in September 2022. Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters\\n\\nWith the CIA and other intelligence agencies, “you take whatever number of employees who are gonna get cut loose and they have knowledge of sensitive programs — that by definition is an insider risk,” this person said. “You’re just rolling the dice that these folks are gonna honor their secrecy agreement and not volunteer to a hostile intelligence service.”\\n\\nAs a result, some officials are considering how to treat those employees who are inevitably fired or elect to take a buyout — including whether to allow them to access agency buildings at all, another person familiar with the discussions said.\\n\\nThe notion that a person fired from the CIA — even for cause — will take what they know to a foreign government isn’t new, former officials noted. When a top aide to the agency’s deputy director was indicted for fraud in 2009 after putting personal expenses on an agency credit card — charges that were expected to render him basically unemployable — senior leaders at the time fretted that he might offer himself up to the highest bidder, current and former officials familiar with the episode said.\\n\\nBut ultimately, the first official said, there’s not much that the agency can do legally to monitor former employees or mitigate the risk.\\n\\nAnother US official sympathetic to Trump’s efforts noted that the kind of person who might do such a thing is precisely the type the agency should be removing from its ranks.\\n\\nBut that doesn’t mean that the threat isn’t real — and, some current and former officials said, self-inflicted.\\n\\n“I’m not sure the administration really understands [that risk] and moreover, even if they understand, it’s not clear they care,” the first official said. But the risk is “real.”\\n\\nExposing covert payments\\n\\nCareer officials have also moved to mitigate what they see as potential counterintelligence risks stemming from the work done by Musk’s DOGE.\\n\\nWhen Bessent signed off on access for DOGE officials to the government’s payment system, intelligence officials immediately flagged that the system isn’t just used for Social Security and Medicaid payments. It’s also used to funnel intelligence community payments — including the CIA’s — whether through front companies or real commercial entities that the intelligence community partners with on sensitive programs.\\n\\n“Literally every payment the US government makes goes through that system. Every. One,” one source familiar with the matter told CNN.\\n\\nAccess granted to individuals without training or experience in the systems, former Treasury officials said, risked exposing a roadmap for foreign intelligence services seeking to build out their understanding of who is receiving funds, in what amounts, and for what purposes.\\n\\nThose concerns were delivered directly to Bessent shortly after his Senate confirmation in a memo from a senior career Treasury official, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.\\n\\nThe memo included a series of risk-mitigation suggestions, all of which Bessent signed off on, one of the people said.\\n\\nA recent sworn declaration filed in court by the career Treasury official who oversees the Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s information and security operations provided a window into the potential risks, which included “access to sensitive data elements, insider threat risk, and other risks that are inherent to any user access to sensitive IT systems.”\\n\\nJoseph Gioeli, the Fiscal Service’s Deputy Commissioner for Transformation and Modernization, also detailed expansive security infrastructure urgently built around Marko Elez, a DOGE engineer granted “read-only” access to the systems.\\n\\nThat included cybersecurity tools built onto Elez’s only point of entry into the payments system – a provided laptop. The laptop tools allowed security officials to monitor the DOGE engineer’s usage “at all times and continuously log his activity.” The laptop’s security configuration blocked USB and mass storage devices, barred access to cloud-storage services and monitored any scripts or commands executed by the employee.\\n\\nData exfiltration detection, which would alert security officials to any effort to transmit sensitive types of data, was also built into the architecture.\\n\\nThe DOGE official agreed to provide an attestation at the end of the work “that any copies of Treasury information made would be properly destroyed, and confirmation that no suspicious or unauthorized access to Bureau information or data had occurred during the engagement,” according to the court filing.\\n\\nSenior Fiscal Service officials “were fully aware of the risks presented by Mr. Elez’s work and sought to mitigate those risks to the extent possible.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, at Langley, near-daily rumors continue to swirl that Musk’s DOGE warriors — or Musk himself — will turn up, sparking speculation about whether they or he will actually be let inside.'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-24T11:00:47',\n",
       "   'content': 'CNN —\\n\\nDressed for the coldest conditions, I step out of the zodiac and place my feet on the White Continent for the first time.\\n\\nI feel a little awkward, because I’m still finding my way in this Antarctic armor. I’m wearing four layers on top, including three jackets, all of their hoods over my head. Thick winter gloves cover my fingers. In my pocket is, of all things, a bag of ashes, which adds to the bulk. I can feel the bump it makes on the right side of my jacket as I bend over and secure my snowshoes.\\n\\nI brought the bag because, like many travelers, I thought spreading Dad’s ashes somewhere special would be a nice tribute. This June will be 10 years since he died, and it would have been special to share this trip to Antarctica with him. Maybe a ceremonial offering, such as the spreading of his ashes, could suffice.\\n\\nI’m prepared to spread the ashes on this very walk, amongst the icebergs, mountains, penguins and glacier blue ice. But, before we set off on the snowshoe, the guide gives a safety briefing that cools my jets.\\n\\nAntarctica has strict regulations — nothing should touch the ground other than our boots. No sitting. No snow angels. No packs on the ground. Do not toss away food or pour out drinks. Under no circumstances should anything be left behind, he says.\\n\\nWhen drawing up this dream ceremony, it never occurred to me to think about any rules or regulations surrounding the spreading of ashes. Turns out, not only do ash-scattering restrictions exist, but all around the world, there are specific rules about where and how you can spread them both on land and in the water.\\n\\nAuthor Will McGough poses in the snow in Antarctica. Will McGough/Wake and Wander Media\\n\\nRules and restrictions in different places\\n\\nThe rules vary a lot from place to place. In the United Kingdom, for example, you don’t need a license or permission to scatter cremated remains at sea, the only guidance being to avoid popular areas such as marinas.\\n\\nThe regulations in the United States differ by state, and the governing bodies vary. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency regulates ocean burials. National Parks oversee their own regulations. State and local governments handle ash policies for non-federal pieces of public land, such as state parks, city parks, inland bodies of water and coastlines.\\n\\nGenerally, it is legal to scatter ashes anywhere on land in the United States so long as you have permission from the private landowner or a permit from the public land-use office. Private land could be your own, your neighbor’s or that of a third-party such as a cemetery or stadium.\\n\\nFor public land, the likelihood of being issued a permit for ash disposal in parks, lakes, streams, and forests will vary by state, with some types of public land — beaches, for one — being off-limits entirely. Yes, scattering ashes along the coast is technically illegal despite it being a common scene we see portrayed in shows and movies.\\n\\nWhen holding a ceremony at sea, the general rule is that you must be at least three miles off shore — scattering in the shallows while you stand in the surf is not permitted. You’re also supposed to report the burial to the EPA within 30 days, but there’s no application or paperwork required in advance.\\n\\nFor the most part, the same rules and regulations apply to the transport and dispersal of pet ashes. But there are exceptions. For example, pet remains are not allowed to be buried at sea, according to the EPA (but are they are being used to restore coral reefs in Florida).\\n\\nTechnically, you could be fined for spreading ashes in a restricted area without the proper paperwork or approval.\\n\\nA violation of the Antarctic Treaty\\n\\nAntarctica plays by its own set of rules. It is the coldest, highest, driest and windiest continent on planet Earth. It was discovered and reached by man for the first time not much more than 200 years ago. Many of history’s most colorful explorers — James Cook, Ernest Shackleton, Roald Amundsen and Robert Scott, to name a few — were involved in the search for, discovery of and mapping of its icy waters and ice-covered landscape, with many lives lost in pursuit.\\n\\nAccording to the guide on my trip, spreading Dad’s remains in Antarctica would run afoul of the Antarctic Treaty that protects the continent’s pristine environment and maintains it as a land of science and peace. Twelve countries, including the United States, originally signed it in 1959 — now, nearly 60 countries participate.\\n\\nI respect what he’s saying, but I don’t want these ashes burning a hole in my pocket all trip. I decide that “illegal” scattering must happen all the time, and that I’ve come too far to turn back now. I’ll do it in secret, shake the ashes out of my pant leg or something, like Andy Dufresne in “Shawshank Redemption.” I could probably bend over and bury them before anyone knows what happened.\\n\\nWe reach the top of the ridge, eventually stopping on a perch overlooking the lagoon. The view is incredible. The sun peaks out of the clouds, illuminating the ice in the lagoon, and, for the first time, I see the blue of the Antarctic sky beyond the snow-covered peaks. Humpback whales are spouting; penguins waddle on the rocks near the water; icebergs sport a glacial-blue color.\\n\\nIt’s the perfect spot. Turning away from the group, I reach for the bag.\\n\\nVisitors to Antarctica must follow rules to protect the environment. Will McGough/Wake and Wander Media\\n\\nTraveling with ashes is on the rise\\n\\nMy quest is not unique. Consider TIME’s 2013 documentary on cremation’s growing popularity, or CNN’s 2020 article on the topic. Though less than 4% of Americans were cremated back in 1960, more than 50% of people are cremated today, leading to a growth in the number of ceremonial tributes and burials.\\n\\nThe idea of spreading ashes on a trip is popular enough that Carnival Cruise Lines has its own scattering service, where a private event is arranged for families to partake in a burial at sea. Same thing over at Royal Caribbean, and several other cruise companies, whose ships travel far off the coast, beyond the reaches of regulations.\\n\\nDemand is large enough that smaller, independent boating companies have introduced “ash scattering cruises” in various coastal destinations, with the aim of helping folks get the required three miles offshore. Some offer a surprising variety of services, from the standard “Private Ash Scattering Cruise” to the “Deluxe Unattended Ash Scattering With Video” package.\\n\\nTransporting ashes through TSA checkpoints and on an airplane is widely accepted, though there are rules about the container that can be used, and they differ slightly by airline, so check with your carrier before flying.\\n\\nWhen traveling internationally, it’s a good idea to check a country’s regulations pertaining to cremated remains to avoid a hassle at the border. You may need to present a death certificate and other paperwork at customs upon request.\\n\\nThe majesty of the landscape holds its own meaning. Will McGough/Wake and Wander Media\\n\\nHe is not there\\n\\nThe beauty of the view has me bursting with energy and gratitude. But I notice that every time I look over my shoulder to ensure the guide is still preoccupied, something feels wrong.\\n\\nWhat kind of memory am I trying to create here? The one where I can tell everyone that I illegally buried my father? He was a longtime law enforcement official, so I know he wouldn’t approve. And what if the guide sees me and gets upset? Will he think I am disrespecting this pristine environment? How will that memory help me make peace with Dad?\\n\\nI change my plans and pull out only the prayer card that’s beside the bag. I take a deep breath as I scan the landscape, the snowy hill leading down to the berg-filled lagoon. I see Dad’s smiling face on the front of the card — one of the few good pictures I have of him — then turn it over to see my favorite bereavement poem on the back. I read the words silently to myself:\\n\\nDo not stand at my grave and weep.\\n\\nI am not there. I do not sleep.\\n\\nI am a thousand winds that blow.\\n\\nI am the diamond glints on snow.\\n\\nI am the sunlight on ripened grain.\\n\\nI am the gentle autumn rain.\\n\\nWhen you awaken in the morning’s hush\\n\\nI am the swift uplifting rush\\n\\nOf quiet birds in circled flight.\\n\\nI am the soft stars that shine at night.\\n\\nDo not stand at my grave and cry;\\n\\nI am not there. I did not die.\\n\\nReturning down the ridge, I feel open and raw. With the lagoon in full sight, the sound of the shoes on the snow becomes melodic, medicinal. The spirit of the land enters me. I notice the cold air in my lungs. My brain starts buzzing. The thousand winds that blow. The diamond glints on snow. He is not there. He did not die.\\n\\nYes, I had wanted to give my dad a proper ash scattering here on my big trip to Antarctica. Like many, I wanted to honor him in that way, with that ceremony. But I think the mission is accomplished regardless. After all, I’m here in this special place, and I’m thinking about him, and there are many days ahead of us.\\n\\nMaybe it makes sense to spread the ashes closer to home, where he spent his life. Maybe that’s the best idea. I’m not sure. But I know that, either way, it probably doesn’t matter. The most important thing is that I have remembered, once again, that he’s still along for the ride, that he is still with me, today and always.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Rome AP —\\n\\nAn American Airlines flight from New York to New Delhi, India, landed safely in Rome on Sunday afternoon after it was diverted due to a security concern, which later proved to be “non-credible,” the airline said.\\n\\nAmerican Airlines said Flight 292 “was inspected by law enforcement” after landing at Leonardo da Vinci International Airport and “cleared to re-depart.”\\n\\nIt didn’t clarify the cause of the security concern, but added an inspection was required by protocol before the flight could land in New Delhi.\\n\\n“The flight will stay in Rome overnight to allow for required crew rest before continuing to Delhi as soon as possible tomorrow,” the airline said.\\n\\nAn Associated Press reporter filmed two fighter jets flying over the airport shortly before the unscheduled landing. Fire trucks were visible on the landing strip on one side of the plane after it landed.\\n\\nNeeraj Chopra, one of the passengers on board, said the captain announced that the plane had to turn around about three hours before it was supposed to land in New Delhi because of a change in “security status.”\\n\\nChopra, who was traveling from Detroit, Michigan to visit family, described the mood on the plane as calm after the initial announcement but said he began to feel stressed when the captain later announced that fighter jets would be escorting their plane to Rome.\\n\\n“I felt a little panic of, okay, what’s going on here?” Chopra told the AP. “There’s got to be like something bigger going on here.”\\n\\nPassenger Jonathan Bacon, 22, from Dayton, Ohio, started paying attention to the flight tracker on the seatback in front of him after the captain’s announcement of a “diversion due to a security issue,” observing the plane’s sharp turn away from New Delhi and route back toward Rome.\\n\\nPassengers had no internet connection for much of the flight, Bacon said, with only some spotty access that clued them into early reports of the situation about two hours before landing.\\n\\nAfter landing, Bacon said all passengers were loaded onto buses and taken to the terminal, where each passenger and their personal items underwent additional security screenings that were time-consuming and felt “slightly heightened,” especially for arrivals. More than two hours after landing, Bacon and his friend said they were still waiting for their checked baggage, which they said was also undergoing security screenings.\\n\\n“It was definitely the longest flight to Europe I’ve ever taken,” Bacon said.\\n\\nA spokesperson for the airport said it was continuing to operate normally.'},\n",

BENOIT PEYRUCQ via Getty Images\\n\\nA former surgeon went on trial in France on Monday for the alleged rape or sexual abuse of 299 victims, most of them children who were his patients, in what investigators and his own notebooks describe as a pattern of violence spanning over three decades.\\n\\nJoël Le Scouarnec, now 74, will face hundreds of victims during his four-month trial in Vannes, Brittany. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted, on top of 15 years he has been serving after being found guilty in 2020 of rape and sexual assault of children.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHis lawyer, Maxime Tessier, told the court that Le Scouarnec accepts responsibility for “a large majority” of the allegations against him.\\n\\nSome survivors have no memory of the assaults, having been unconscious at the time. One man now in his thirties testified that he was assaulted during a consultation in 1995, when he was just a young boy.\\n\\n“I remember certain things in the recovery room. I was in total panic. I called my dad,” he told the court.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTrial builds on Gisèle Pélicot’s momentum\\n\\nLe Scouarnec’s trial comes as activists are pushing to dismantle taboos that have long surrounded sexual abuse in France. The most prominent case was that of Gisèle Pélicot, who was drugged and raped by her now ex-husband and dozens of other men who were convicted and sentenced in December to prison terms ranging from three to 20 years.\\n\\nThe Le Scouarnec case began in 2017, when a 6-year-old neighbor said the doctor had touched her over the fence separating their properties.\\n\\nA subsequent search of his home uncovered more than 300,000 photos, 650 pedophilic, zoophilic and scatological video files, as well as notebooks where he described himself as a pedophile and detailed his actions, according to investigation documents.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn 2020, Le Scouarnec was convicted of rape and sexual assault of four children, including two nieces, and was sentenced to 15 years in prison.\\n\\nHe has admitted to child abuse dating to 1985-1986, but some cases could not be prosecuted because the statute of limitations has expired.\\n\\nTrial focuses on 25-year span\\n\\nThe Vannes trial will examine alleged rapes and other abuses committed between 1989 and 2014 against 158 men and 141 women who were aged 11 on average at the time.\\n\\nThe doctor sexually abused both boys and girls when they were alone in their hospital rooms, according to investigation documents.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“I didn’t really remember the operation. I remembered the post-operation, a surgeon who was quite mean,” one of the victims, Amélie Lévêque, recalled of her time in the hospital when she was 9 years old in 1991. “I cried a lot.”\\n\\nYears later, she described feeling overwhelmed when she learned that her name appeared in Le Scouarnec’s notebooks.\\n\\n“That was the beginning of the answers to a lifetime of questions, and then it was the beginning of the descent into hell,” she told public broadcaster France 3. “I felt like I had lost control of everything. I wasn’t crazy, but now I had to face the truth of what had happened.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“I fell into a deep depression. ... My family tried to help, but I felt completely alone.”\\n\\nThe Associated Press does not name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified or decide to tell their stories publicly.\\n\\nLe Scouarnec had already been convicted in 2005 for possessing and importing child sexual abuse material and sentenced to four months of suspended prison time. Despite that conviction, he was appointed as a hospital practitioner the following year.\\n\\nGo Ad-Free — And Protect The Free Press The next four years will change America forever.

       "   'content': 'At face value, Donald Trump and his team are overseeing the executive branch of the federal government. Dig a little deeper, however, and it appears the president and his operation are simultaneously doing something qualitatively different: They’re putting on a show.\\n\\nCNN reported about a month ago, for example, that the administration’s deportation sweeps were designed to be “camera-ready” and featured a “made-for-TV look.” Soon after, Axios published a related report that Team Trump’s immigration crackdown includes an emphasis on “choreography, photo ops, wardrobe changes and tough talk.” A White House official said the focus on “the visuals” was deliberate.\\n\\nThe New York Times added that as president’s second term gets underway, “there is already a pronounced trend in how he and his allies are using imagery with an almost imperial aesthetic to project an air of ubiquity, authority and invincibility.” Not only are the administration’s immigration enforcement raids packaged “like mini reality-TV shows — complete with perp walks and even guest stars,” but Trump’s signing ceremonies are also “playlets of theatrical conquest.”\\n\\nThat report was published nearly a week before the White House released what it referred to as an “ASMR” video mocking immigrants being deported.\\n\\nWith this in mind, perhaps it’s not too surprising that the Department of Homeland Security is airing taxpayer-financed ads that celebrate Trump — and the commercials were apparently Trump’s idea. Rolling Stone reported:\\n\\nThe Department of Homeland Security has budgeted up to $200 million to run anti-immigrant ads in the United States and overseas that repeatedly thank President Donald Trump for leading an immigration crackdown. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Friday night that these ads were Trump’s idea, and during the administration’s transition to power, the president asked her to star in ads thanking him “for closing the border.”\\n\\nOn the surface, it’s important to emphasize that the idea behind these kinds of ads is not especially controversial. On the contrary, other recent administrations have taken similar steps, engaging in public information campaigns in the hopes of discouraging those planning to enter the United States illegally.\\n\\nThe problem with this specific ad campaign is what Noem’s DHS included in the message.\\n\\nAccording to the version of events that the South Dakota Republican shared at the Conservative Political Action Conference’s Ronald Reagan Dinner on Friday night, Trump told Noem, in reference to the anti-immigration messaging, “We’re not going to let the media tell this story, because the media will never tell the truth. We’re going to run a marketing campaign to make sure the American people know the truth of what you’re doing.”\\n\\nNoem added that the president told her, “I want you in the ads, and I want your face in the ads … but I want the first ad, I want you to thank me. I want you to thank me for closing the border.”\\n\\nThe DHS secretary, as part of the same story, claims she told Trump, “I said, ‘Yes, sir, I will thank you for closing the border.’ So if you notice, in that ad, we thanked him for closing the border.”\\n\\nA few glaring problems stand out.\\n\\nFor one thing, Trump didn’t close the border. For another, the idea that American taxpayers are funding what appear to be propaganda ads celebrating Trump is tough to defend.\\n\\nBut in case that weren’t quite enough, let’s also not forget that the Department of Homeland Security is reportedly in the process of firing hundreds of high-level employees, which will come on top of hundreds of more general cuts, which targeted the Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\\n\\nIt’s hard not to wonder how those ousted DHS workers feel about the apparent fact that the department doesn’t have the resources to keep them employed, but it does have the resources to air pro-Trump television ads.'},\n",

       "   'title': \"Steve Bannon's CPAC gesture resembled a Nazi salute. He knew what he was doing.\",\n",
       "   'time': '2025-02-22T00:41:19',\n",
       "   'content': 'At the end of his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday evening, MAGA activist Steve Bannon shouted “Fight! Fight! Fight!” and straightened his right arm swiftly, holding it at an elevated, roughly 45-degree angle, and then quickly pulled it back down again. After his arm returned to his side, he yelled “Amen.” Any person with the faintest knowledge of Western history would recognize the gesture as a Nazi salute.\\n\\nBannon has denied it was supposed to be a Nazi salute. In an interview with NBC News at the conference Thursday, Bannon said, “I do that all the time. I wave to my crowd, because it’s all about them.” But if you watch the video, no reasonable person would describe the gesture as a wave.\\n\\nBannon lacks the plausible deniability about accidental gestures that Musk had at his disposal.\\n\\nSome media outlets suggested Bannon’s gesture mimicked that of megabillionaire Elon Musk, who carried out what many say resembled a Nazi salute at an inauguration event for President Donald Trump in January. Musk’s gesture triggered a debate about his true intentions. After the forceful extension of his arm — executed with an audible grunt — he did it once more and then said, “My heart goes out to you,” leading some people to believe that it may have been an unintentionally unfortunate-looking attempt to engage the crowd. Musk later deemed the accusations as “dirty tricks” in a post on X. But notably, he also made several Nazi-related puns on his social media platform, leaving some to wonder if perhaps he meant to provoke a polarizing response. “When I see the troll emoji, it’s like looking in the mirror,” he wrote a few days later.\\n\\nBannon lacks the plausible deniability about accidental gestures that Musk had at his disposal. Bannon, an influential podcast host and the former chief strategist for Trump during his first term, is a savvy communicator and extremely plugged in to the news cycle. It is safe to assume he knows about what Musk did, which is why some media outlets described Bannon as imitating him. That this happened after Musk’s gesture was widely criticized by many as a Nazi salute feeds the theory that it was a conscious provocation. Moreover, Bannon made no comment akin to “My heart goes out to you” as Musk did, which might have confounded efforts to pin down Bannon’s meaning.\\n\\nJordan Bardella, the leader of France’s far-right National Rally party, canceled his appearance at CPAC after Bannon’s speech, citing his condemnation of a speaker who “as a provocation” made “a gesture referring to Nazi ideology.” Bannon told the French newspaper Le Point, “If he canceled [the speech] over what the mainstream media said about the speech, he didn’t listen to the speech. ... He’s a boy, not a man.” The Holocaust-denying white supremacist Nick Fuentes said in response to the speech: “It was a straight-up Roman salute. It’s getting a little uncomfortable even for me.”\\n\\nSo what is Bannon doing? His gesture serves as a signaling device to attract the most noxious, militant and overtly fascistic elements of the American far right to support the president. In his speech, Bannon addressed his audience as “the tip of the tip of the spear of the populist nationalist movement,” celebrated the release of Jan. 6 prisoners and said, “We want Trump in ’28.” Put it all together and Bannon is inviting extremists to mobilize on behalf of Trump’s authoritarian project on a level previously unseen.\\n\\nEven if we were to understand Bannon’s gesture as “trolling,” it is still an insidious strategy that carnivalizes Nazism. Even as a winking reference to Musk’s odd, disturbing gesture (whose darkest implications Musk refused to fully repudiate), it still radiates an ease and playfulness toward Nazi iconography. Why choose this specific gesture, a clear reference to the most universally acknowledged symbol of Nazism other than the swastika, as a “joke” to “troll the media” or “own the libs”? It still has the effect of making fascism and white supremacy look less ominous and less taboo, and maybe for some on the right, a little more intriguing than before.\\n\\nEven as a “joke,” it acts as a path to mainstreaming some of the most heinous ideas that humanity has ever conceived of. It chips away at the cultural and political guardrails our society has developed against autocracy, vigilante racial domination, hatred of “the other.” And this all comes as Trump develops closer ties with Germany’s far-right party, Alternative for Germany, some of whose members have used Nazi slogans.\\n\\nBannon’s gesture doesn’t mean he is a Nazi nor does it signify a wholesale defense of Nazi ideals. But it does mean he is willing to play around with the aura and symbology of Nazism to achieve his political goals. At any level of interpretation, Bannon’s gesture is abhorrent, and it speaks volumes about his political movement if he retains power within it.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Whether a person is American or from another country, whether they live next door or half a world away, whether they are our best friend or a complete stranger, Christianity compels its followers to care for them and to help them. Today, this core Christian value is under threat, not from foreign enemies but from our own government, which has proudly proclaimed that the U.S. Agency for International Development is going into the “wood chipper.”\\n\\nAnd while the sudden suspension of the USAID program is among a number of disappointing actions taken by the new administration, what is particularly alarming is that it’s destroying this humanitarian work with the tacit (if not explicit) support of too many people who cite the Gospels as their guide.\\n\\nWith the latest announced cuts in federal spending, many of the programs that have helped people in need across the globe are at risk.\\n\\nWhile I am not in a position to judge all of the policies or practices of USAID, I do know the agency is charged with caring for vulnerable children throughout the world. The U.S. is — and should be — the largest donor for children in the world. Yet, with the latest announced cuts in federal spending, many of the programs that have helped people in need across the globe are at risk, such as the AIDS relief effort credited with saving 25 million lives, mostly in Africa.\\n\\nFunding cuts will also hurt Christian charitable groups that receive financial assistance from the U.S. government. Two of the largest organizations, Catholic Relief Services and World Vision (an evangelical organization), are heavily dependent on government funding to perform their lifesaving work: Catholic Relief received 64% of its revenue from government contributions in 2022; World Vision received 44% in the same year. Both are now facing massive layoffs.\\n\\nAlso disturbing to me are radical cuts to efforts by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide relief for areas hit by major disasters in the U.S., and layoffs at the Federal Housing Administration that threaten to disrupt its ability to provide the mortgage insurance on which millions of Americans depend.\\n\\nAll this by an administration that so far has enjoyed strong support among Christians. The situation leads me to wonder whether some Christians have made a single issue or two the sole determinant of their political views and, by doing so, have sold their souls in a Faustian deal for political power. According to an NBC News exit poll in the 2024 election, 63% of voters in the “Protestant or other Christians” demographic supported the new administration. If we restrict this to white people, the number climbs to 72%. Fifty-nine percent of all Catholics and 63% of white Catholics voted for Donald Trump. White evangelicals supported Trump with 82% support. These numbers represent a solid bloc of Christian voters.\\n\\nThis level of support makes me deeply concerned that many will associate Christianity with this administration’s policies, like the closing of USAID and cuts to other programs that provide assistance to the poor. In particular, I worry that the younger generation will either come to dismiss Christianity as amoral or identify with it for its relationship to political power rather than its moral and spiritual principles. Neither option is acceptable in my judgment.\\n\\nI worry that the younger generation will either come to dismiss Christianity as amoral or identify with it for its relationship to political power rather than its moral and spiritual principles.\\n\\nAt a recent discussion of my colleague Phil Gorski’s work “The Flag and the Cross,” which explores the rise of Christian nationalism, I asked Gorski whether Christianity had become a dirty word. He responded, “You are right as dean of the divinity school to be worried about this.” When I asked a good friend who was the senior pastor of a large church in Manhattan what he thought of this, he said he had quit using the word Christian to describe himself and preferred to use “follower of Jesus Christ.”\\n\\nIn “Where Love Is, There God Is Also,” one of Leo Tolstoy’s most famous short stories, a cobbler named Martin takes a friend’s advice to read the Gospels. One evening, he hears a disembodied voice promise to visit him the next day. Martin watches but only meets an old soldier, to whom he gives some hot tea; a woman with a baby, to whom he gives a cup of soup and an old cloak; and a woman in a confrontation with a boy who has attempted to steal an apple. Martin makes that situation right by giving the boy the apple and compensating the woman.\\n\\nIn response to a knock at his door that evening, Martin asks, “Who is it?” and each of the people he’d met that day steps forward to say, “It is I,” only to disappear. Martin returns to his reading and sees: “I was hungry and you gave me meat; I was thirsty and you gave me drink; I was a stranger and you took me in.” This is perhaps the most famous interpretation of the parable of the sheep and goats in Matthew. In my judgment, the “parable” draws on the ancient literary tradition of deities who disguise themselves as humans to see how humans treat strangers.\\n\\nThe proposed closure of USAID and the pulling of funds from other agencies and groups that care for the “hungry … thirsty … stranger … naked … ill … imprisoned” is anti-Christian at its core. It reflects a rejection of a basic value that Jews and Christians (and many others) hold as sacred. Christians may disagree about a number of important issues, but the imperative to care for the downtrodden is not one of them. Pope Francis and Gabriel Salguero, president of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition, have raised their voices in protest.\\n\\nIt is time for many of the rest of us to join them.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'As Donald Trump prepared to exit the White House the first time, the then-president shielded most Venezuelans in the United States from deportation, agreeing that the situation in their country was “catastrophic.” His Democratic successor agreed: Joe Biden extended the Temporary Protected Status designation to nearly 350,000 Venezuelans who are in the U.S., and the protections were supposed to remain in place through the fall of 2026.\\n\\nTwo weeks into his second term, Trump reversed course, ended the protections and put the Venezuelans at risk for deportation. The community, especially in Florida, was outraged.\\n\\n“Betrayed. We feel betrayed. More than betrayed. Beyond betrayed,” Adeyls Ferro, executive director of the Venezuelan American Caucus in Doral, Florida, told NBC News.\\n\\nTwo weeks later, the Republican president did it again. NBC News also reported:\\n\\nThe Trump administration on Thursday canceled an extension of Temporary Protected Status for Haitians, the latest move by the president targeting the form of immigration relief for people coming from countries facing political upheaval and natural disasters. In June, amid the island’s violent domestic turmoil, the Biden administration announced the temporary immigration protection was extended for Haitians until February 2026.\\n\\nThe protections will now end this August.\\n\\n“The Trump administration is ripping stability away from half a million Haitians who have built their lives here — children, workers, parents, and neighbors who have become integral to American communities and contributed to our economy,” Beatriz Lopez, co-executive director of the Immigration Hub, an immigrant advocacy organization, said in a statement. “Deporting people to a country plagued by violence and political turmoil is unconscionable, and stripping them of legal status will only force working families into the shadows, inflicting fear in children and their loved ones and leaving industries like healthcare, construction, and hospitality scrambling for workers.”\\n\\nIt’s easy to forget, but in 2016, when Florida was still seen as a battleground state, Trump campaigned in Miami and spent some time at the Little Haiti Cultural Center, stressing the “common values” he shared with Haitian Americans.\\n\\n“Whether you vote for me or not,” the then-candidate said at the time, “I really want to be your biggest champion.”\\n\\nA year later, he scrapped temporary status protection for Haitians who were allowed entry to the U.S. following a devastating earthquake in 2010.\\n\\nA year after that, the Republican hosted a White House meeting and referred to Haiti as a “s---hole” country.\\n\\nSix years after that, Trump based part of his 2024 presidential campaign on racist and false claims about Haitian Americans in Ohio eating household pets.\\n\\nAnd now Trump is again betraying the community he vowed to “champion.”\\n\\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-21T22:12:17',\n",
       "   'content': 'Welcome back, Deadline: Legal Newsletter readers. When we left off last week, Emil Bove was scouring the Justice Department halls for a warm body to sign his motion to dismiss charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. One of the prosecutors who refused said he thought the acting deputy attorney general would eventually find someone foolish or cowardly enough to do his dirty work. As it turned out, Bove signed it himself, and the former Trump defense lawyer appeared alone this week on behalf of the United States for a historically strange hearing in New York.\\n\\nA “somewhat unusual situation” is how U.S. District Judge Dale Ho understatedly assessed it. The oddness stemmed partly from the fact that it wasn’t an adversarial proceeding. That is, Bove and Adams want the case dismissed “without prejudice,” which would just so happen to give the Republican administration the option of reviving it later. Nonetheless, Bove and Adams reiterated at Wednesday’s hearing that it’s definitely not a quid pro quo, even though the Trump DOJ wants to trade a temporary case dismissal (quid) for (pro) political cooperation (quo). But whether by coincidence or totally on purpose, such a dismissal would give the White House political leverage over the Democratic mayor on matters of immigration enforcement and who knows what else.\\n\\nFaced with this farce, Judge Ho made an interesting move. Rather than rubber-stamp the deal or reject it outright, the Biden appointee brought in a third party to explore legal issues that neither side raised (because they’re basically on the same side). And the judge didn’t just pick any old lawyer. He chose Paul Clement, a conservative with impeccable credentials, who will give Ho his learned opinion before the judge decides whether to grant the dismissal without prejudice. In an order Friday, Ho explained his thinking in noting that defendants often contest such dismissals. Now it’ll be Clement filling that role, with briefs on a spate of legal questions Ho laid out in his order due March 7, with possible oral argument on March 14.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that no decision has been made in the Adams affair, and it will be at least a couple more weeks before that is resolved.\\n\\nElsewhere in the DOJ’s banner week, the Republican-controlled Senate confirmed Trump loyalist and 2020 election denier Kash Patel to lead the FBI. He’s not to be confused with Trump loyalist and 2020 election denier Pam Bondi — our recently confirmed attorney general — or Trump loyalist and 2020 election denier Ed Martin, the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. Trump said this week that he wants Martin to lead the office full time, after an interim stint marked by railing against the office’s Jan. 6 prosecutions, posting letters pledging allegiance to Elon Musk on the billionaire’s social media platform, and threatening various investigations against Democrats.\\n\\nSpeaking of ham-fisted investigations, yet another prosecutor resigned this week rather than carry out what she described as orders from Trump-appointed officials to take actions unsupported by the evidence. DOJ veteran Denise Cheung was asked to review documentation from Bove’s office “to open a criminal investigation into whether a contract had been unlawfully awarded by an executive agency” during the Biden administration. While the details behind this latest apparent scandal are a little murky, the picture of the Trump DOJ becomes clearer as a tool for punishing political opponents and rewarding allies.\\n\\nAnd in the rash of Trump 2.0 civil litigation still unfolding, contempt was on the table this week in a case over the government’s foreign aid freeze. Trump officials escaped a civil contempt finding sought by plaintiffs who claimed brazen defiance of U.S. District Judge Amir Ali’s temporary restraining order. In their contempt motion, the plaintiffs cited (among other things) Trump’s recent statement on social media that “he who saves his Country does not violate any Law.” Judge Ali stopped short of contempt, but the Biden appointee reiterated the government’s duty to obey his order, as litigation continues alongside broader questions of the administration’s compliance with court orders in this case and others — and, perhaps more importantly, how judges respond to those questions.\\n\\nHave any questions or comments for me?

       "   'time': '2025-02-24T11:00:41',\n",
       "   'content': 'This post is part of the digital companion series to Jen Psaki’s “The Blueprint,” a new podcast examining where Democrats stand after big losses in 2024 and how they can win again. New episodes come out on Mondays. Listen wherever you get your podcasts. Below is an adapted excerpt from the Feb. 24 episode featuring Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois.\\n\\nIt’s no secret Democrats and Kamala Harris faced a lot of challenges in November’s election. The first and foremost was that Joe Biden decided, long after the primary process, that he was no longer staying on the ballot. That was something that had never happened before in my lifetime and it was a challenge that no modern political party had seen before.\\n\\nThat meant whoever became the Democratic nominee would have to deal with the impact of Biden’s decision. Of course, Harris eventually became that nominee, but she did so without going through a primary process. That presented another huge challenge for the Democrats.\\n\\nIf you walk down the street and stop people and ask what’s really bothering them and what they’d like to see the government address, it’s affordability.\\n\\nAs someone in public office, I understand the importance of the primary process. When I first ran for governor, people didn’t know anything about me. I entered the race way behind the front-runner. I had to go through almost a full year of a primary for people to learn about me and my background rather than just going with whatever image was created by my opponents.\\n\\nHarris had to jump in without that. Even though she was the sitting vice president, people really didn’t know her. She had not run all the way through the Democratic primaries in 2020, and while in the White House, Harris, as is typical for a vice president, took a back seat to Biden. That’s a huge challenge. She only had 108 days to introduce herself to the American people, allow them to get to know her and feel comfortable with her.\\n\\nThe other challenge was too much messaging focused solely on democracy. If you go out and knock on a hundred doors in any neighborhood across the country — and I’ve knocked on a lot of doors in my life — and you say to those people that democracy is in danger, well, a lot of them wouldn’t know what you’re talking about. They know they go to the polls and vote every two or four years and things just keep going, no matter who gets elected. Democracy being challenged or being at risk isn’t something most people can imagine.\\n\\nThese are the kinds of kitchen table issues that should be the main focus of any Democratic campaign.\\n\\nFor Democrats, this was an election that should have been singularly focused on one issue: affordability. If you walk down the street and stop people and ask what’s really bothering them and what they’d like to see the government address, it’s affordability. They’re worried about going to the grocery store and not being able to buy eggs at a reasonable price. So if Democrats want to reach these voters, they need to address these issues, home in on these concerns and provide solutions.\\n\\nWe did it in Illinois. As governor, I signed a bill to eliminate the state grocery tax. We passed legislation to overhaul the health care industry in the state. These actions addressed concerns people felt in their day-to-day lives. These are the kinds of kitchen table issues that should be the main focus of any Democratic campaign.\\n\\nIf Democrats want to show the American people they’re listening, I know where they can start: One issue that was rarely mentioned during the campaign was the fight to raise the minimum wage. On the federal level, the minimum wage is only $7.25. That amounts to just $15,000 annually. You can’t live on that. In Illinois, we raised the minimum wage to $15, but across the country, many are still struggling to get by.\\n\\nRepublicans want to keep the federal minimum wage at $7.25. In fact, some of them want to get rid of it altogether. The Democrats’ platform calls for raising the federal minimum wage to $15. That’s just one everyday issue that the Democratic Party could help solve and make life a little bit easier for the American people — and that’s what the Democrats ought to be about.'},\n",

Luiz C. Ribeiro / New York Daily News via Getty Images file\\n\\nAdams\\' administration said that while an average 4,000 migrants were arriving each week to New York City during the \"height of the international asylum seeker crisis,\" the average number of registrants in the city has dropped down to the about 350 migrants per week in recent months.\\n\\n\"Now, thanks to the sound policy decisions of our team, we are able to announce the closure of this site and help even more asylum seekers take the next steps in their journeys as they envision an even brighter future, while simultaneously saving taxpayers millions of dollars,\" Adams said in a statement.\\n\\nAdams touted that the hotel\\'s closure adds to the plans to close 53 other emergency shelters sites across the city by June. The administration cited less than 45,000 migrants currently being in the city\\'s care, dropping from a high of 69,000 last month.\\n\\nThe mayor\\'s announcement comes just days after the city filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration on Friday, seeking to reclaim $80 million that was previously authorized by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to cover hotel costs for migrants.\\n\\nThe City of New York claims in the lawsuit that the Trump administration \"reached into a central bank account of the City of New York (the “City”) and grabbed\" the money, according to court documents.\\n\\n\"It took these funds from the City without any advance notice that it would be doing so and without communicating any decision or rationale to the City,” the lawsuit said.\\n\\nThe $80 million included both a $59 million grant plus an award of $21.5 million for the city\\'s costs to maintain its asylum seeker system that were awarded during former president Joe Biden\\'s term, but were not disbursed until this month, according to the lawsuit.\\n\\nElon Musk, the billionaire advisor to Trump who operate the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), said in a post on X earlier this month that the funds \"violated the law.\"\\n\\n\"The @DOGE team just discovered that FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants,\" Musk said in the post on Feb. 10. \"Sending this money violated the law and is in gross insubordination to the President’s executive order.\"\\n\\nDepartment of Homeland Security head Kristi Noem, who was also named on the city\\'s lawsuit, said on Feb. 12 that she had \"clawed back the full payment that FEMA deep state activists unilaterally gave to NYC migrant hotels.\"\\n\\nNoem claimed that Roosevelt Hotel served as a \"base of operations\" for Tren de Aragua and was \"used to house Laken Riley\\'s killer.\"\\n\\n\"Mark my words: there will not be a single penny spent that goes against the interest and safety of the American people,\" Noem said in the post on X.\\n\\nThe clash between Adams and the Trump administration comes after Adams has repeated his support for Trump border czar Tom Homan\\'s objectives since meeting with Homan in December.\\n\\nHoman met with Adams again on Feb. 14, saying in a \"Fox and Friends\" interview later that day that he would make sure Adams followed through on his promises.\\n\\n“If he doesn’t come through,” Homan said in the interview, “I’ll be back in New York City and we won’t be sitting on the couch. I’ll be in his office, up his butt saying, ‘Where the hell is the agreement we came to?’”\\n\\nDespite the clash on FEMA funding, Trump\\'s Justice Department did manage to indefinitely delay Adams\\' trial on federal corruption charges last week, leading to accusations of a \"quid pro quo\" arrangement between Adams and Trump on immigration.\\n\\nSeveral top Justice Department officials in New York resigned following the case\\'s dismissal, citing the alleged quid pro quo and urging Adams to resign himself.\\n\\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul decided Thursday that she would not remove Adams from office, but did announce a series of new safeguards she would be introducing in order to limit the authority of his office.'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-24T16:54:20',\n",
       "   'content': \"A woman may have signed her name on the world's oldest dated runestone, researchers in Norway have found, as they piece together the 2,000-year-old puzzle.\\n\\nThe inscription begins with the word “I” in runic script, followed by the name of the writer and a verb that indicates writing, before ending with the word “rune,” researchers wrote earlier this month in the journal Antiquity after studying a fragment of the stone found at a grave site in Hole, a small municipality in southern Norway to the east of the capital, Oslo.\\n\\n“Basically the text would be saying, I, the rune inscriber’s name, wrote the runic inscription,” one of the study’s co-authors, Kristel Zilmer, told NBC News in telephone interview Monday.\\n\\n“It’s a type of inscription also that has parallels in some other romantic inscriptions, basically somebody telling us that they made this inscription,” added Zilmer, a professor of runology at the University of Oslo’s Museum of Cultural History.\\n\\nThe runic stone is visible in a section of excavations. Museum of Cultural History\\n\\nThe researchers said they believed the Germanic alphabetic script was inspired by the Roman alphabet, of which runes formed the foundational blocks in the first A.D. centuries. It was widely used in Scandinavia up until the late Middle Ages.\\n\\nRunic inscriptions have been found on objects such as a bone knife and iron knife from Denmark and a comb, which archeologists have dated to around 150 A.D. Those found on other runestones date to around 700 A.D.\\n\\nOften they bore messages, including spells to bring back the dead and charm words.\\n\\nBut very little is known about their development as it varied over time and deciphering them can be challenging without archaeological context.\\n\\nA reconstruction and accompanying illustrations reveal a runic inscription. Kristel Zilmer\\n\\nThe latest research suggests the fragments, the first of which was discovered in 2021, were part of a single slab. The discovery also brings scientists one step closer to understanding the language’s evolution and the use of such stones, the researchers said.\\n\\nTwo years later, researchers found more fragments and the script on them appeared to continue across the fragments, indicating they were all part of a single stone.\\n\\n“They managed to find two extra pieces, and they fit perfectly within the middle part of one of the inscriptions, and gave us almost a complete inscription,” Zilmer said.\\n\\nDue to the damage and the weathering of the stone, she added that determining the exact text, including the name of the inscriber, is a “bit tricky,” but what especially caught the attention of the researchers is a feature in the name that indicates it ended with a “-u.”\\n\\nExcavations at the Svingerud site, west of Oslo, Norway. Museum of Cultural History\\n\\nIn ancient runic script, she said that would indicate a possible woman’s name which, if confirmed, “would be the earliest known record of a female rune-inscriber.”\\n\\nBecause the fragments found in Hole were buried along with cremated human remains, scientists had the crucial archeological context that allowed them to use radiocarbon dating to confirm the fragments dated between 50 B.C. and 275 A.D.\\n\\n“We may have here a series of events unfolding involving different people,” Zilmer said. “It may be a stone that combines different purposes.”\\n\\nWhile much of the research is still ongoing, “we are still missing significant portions, so there are evident gaps,” she said.\\n\\n“It’s a puzzle with holes, but nonetheless it will be very interesting to see how far we can get, how many of these small fragments, some of these also inscribed, that might be able to connect to each other,” she added.\"},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-24T00:00:00',\n",
       "   'content': 'An international neo-Nazi terrorist group with origins in the US appears to be quickly rebuilding its global and stateside ranks, according to information obtained by the Guardian from its digital accounts.\\n\\nFounded in 2018, the Base has been the intense focus of a years-long FBI counter-terrorism investigation that has resulted in more than a dozen of its members arrested. It has plotted an assassination, mass shootings and other actions in Europe, which made it a proscribed terrorist organization in several countries.\\n\\nBy 2022, it seemed to disappear. Yet its founder and leader, Rinaldo Nazzaro, a former US special forces contractor residing in Russia, used the safety of Russian apps before the November election to recruit and reorganize during a tense political moment. At one point, he even solicited ex-American soldiers with an offer of $1,200 a month to put members through paramilitary training somewhere in the Pacific north-west.\\n\\nThe Base’s regrouping comes at a time when the Trump administration has made it a policy goal to move away from policing far-right extremism and during the appointment of Kash Patel – a Maga acolyte who lauds January 6 attackers and has peddled Qanon conspiracy theories – to helm the FBI. Experts say federal law enforcement ignoring far-right groups such as the Base could expose Americans to increased domestic terror threats.\\n\\nNazzaro’s efforts, so far, appear to be paying off: the Guardian was tipped to an audio message released in mid-February from an assumed new leader of the Base with an American accent, discussing the ambitious future of the group.\\n\\nAfter criticizing other neo-Nazi organizations such as Blood Tribe for publicly protesting against drag-queen story hours in the midwest, the voice preached covert action and quiet preparations for armed cells throughout the US rather than flashy activism.\\n\\n“Are we just going to be reactionary? Or are we going to be part of the solution? The military solution,” they said. “Because inevitably we’re going to end up in some sort of military situation, what are the choices?”\\n\\nThe voice then describes a “black scenario” where the US government soon collapses and there’s a need to “provide for your family” and for “white women”.\\n\\n“There is no political solution, only a military solution,” they can be heard saying under heavy voice modulation. “So act accordingly.”\\n\\nA flurry of new images on the Base’s various social media accounts, some closed and some open, show members claiming to be in the US and across Europe brandishing pistols or military-style rifles and donning the trademark skull mask of the accelerationist neo-Nazi movement – one that demands acts of terrorism to bring down world governments.\\n\\nIn one photo, a member is holding a knife and what appears to be a pistol in front of the Base flag in the United Kingdom, while others feature members in Bulgaria, Italy, Belgium and Sweden. Last week, on the Base’s VKontakte account, it released a video showing a masked man purportedly in Bulgaria firing a pistol three times into the air with the group’s signature black flag beside him.\\n\\nReal arrests show the multimedia posts aren’t a case of digital bluffing. In recent months, authorities in the Netherlands and Italy have carried out multiple arrests of suspected members on terrorism-related charges.\\n\\n“The extreme rightwing terrorist organization the Base was proscribed in the UK since July 2021,” said a spokesperson for the Home Office, the department overseeing British security agencies, adding that being a member of the Base “carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison”.\\n\\nSteven Rai, an analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), has also noticed the Base’s increased activities online.\\n\\n“The Base has released a slow but steady trickle of propaganda over the past several months that has mostly highlighted their presence in Europe, so this shift in focus towards the US should raise alarms,” said Rai.\\n\\n“The timing of this shift is particularly noteworthy – while neo-Nazi accelerationist groups like the Base have been on their back foot due to intense law enforcement pressure, which disrupted their most integral organizers and propaganda artists, they may sense an opening with the recent change of administration in the US.”\\n\\nOn the day of Trump’s inauguration, in a kind of taunt to authorities, the Base released a photo of the largest number of American members in one photo in over a year, two of them holding guns. The Base also solicited donations to a Bitcoin wallet, asking for money for weapons and ammunition. Shortly after, it thanked supporters for donations, then proudly displayed blanks they will put “to good use” and use to “train in small unit tactics”.\\n\\nThe FBI declined to comment on whether it will prioritize investigations into the Base or other far-right extremists in the future.\\n\\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the Base also acknowledged the threat of law enforcement and released a new oath for American members, which included requirements to have a personal AR-15 rifle and nine 30-round magazines of ammunition.\\n\\n“I willingly accept the risk of being targeted by law enforcement as a result of my membership in the Base to include being placed on government watchlists,” reads part of that oath. “However, if questioned by law enforcement, I will say nothing.”\\n\\nColin Clarke, a terrorism expert and director of research at the Soufan Center, believes the far right has sensed their window of opportunity.\\n\\n“I think groups like the Base, far-right extremist groups that are strategic, have been waiting for the right opportunity before reinvigorating their respective organizations,” he said, adding that it’s expected that Patel will direct counter-terrorism assets towards leftwing organizations. “This means that far-right extremist groups likely perceive the re-election of Trump as a green light to rebuild without fear of arrest or prosecution.”\\n\\nRai concurred: “Violent extremists are absolutely paying attention to the changes in the national security establishment in the US.”\\n\\nContacted via encrypted text, Nazzaro would not answer if the audio message was the voice of a new leader that he hired to be his proxy in the US. He did mention that the Base supports neither Republicans or Democrats and that Trump’s presidency is irrelevant to his movement.\\n\\n“At worst, it gives false hope by perpetuating the erroneous notion that a political solution is possible,” he said.\\n\\nSuspicions have surrounded Nazzaro and his connections to Russian intelligence agencies. Living now as a semi-defected American in Saint Petersburg, his work with US special forces during the war on terror meant he had a top secret clearance while fighting insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan. But only a few years after that work, he would found a neo-Nazi terrorist group of his own that sees the US government as the enemy.\\n\\nNazzaro has denied any and all links to the Kremlin, once telling Russian state television that he has “never had any contact with any Russian security services”.\\n\\nClarke is skeptical and said that Nazzaro’s presence in Russia means “Russian intelligence services will inevitably wield influence over the Base and could be orchestrating some of the organization’s next moves, especially in terms of recruitment and propaganda”.\\n\\nWestern intelligence agencies are constantly warning that the Kremlin is seeking to destabilize Nato member states, including supporting violent, far-right organizations in Europe. Late last year, Ken McCallum, the head of MI5, said that Russia was using “arson, sabotage” and other “actions conducted with increasing recklessness” on European and British soil.'},\n",

The research reveals how burning oil, coal, and methane is roasting the planet’s cocoa belt and skyrocketing chocolate prices.\\n\\n“One of the foods that the world most loves is at risk because of climate change,” said Kristina Dahl, vice president for science at the nonprofit Climate Central, which wrote one of the two reports. “I would hope that by hearing that human activity is making it harder to grow cocoa, it might cause people to stop and think about our priorities as a species, and whether we can and should be prioritizing actions to limit future climate change and future harms to this food that we love so much.”\\n\\nAbout 70 percent of the world’s cacao is grown in West Africa, with Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Cameroon, and Nigeria the biggest producers. The bulk of the rest is grown in places with similar climates not far from the equator, such as Indonesia and Ecuador. The trees grow best in rainforest conditions with high humidity, abundant rain, nitrogen-rich soil, and natural wind buffers. Exposure to temperatures higher than 89.6 degrees Fahrenheit prompts water stress, hinders plant growth, and erodes the quality and quantity of seeds the trees yield.\\n\\nLast year, warming added at least six weeks’ worth of days above that threshold in nearly two-thirds of cacao-producing areas across Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Cameroon, and Nigeria, likely contributing to a disastrous harvest, according to the Climate Central report.\\n\\nThe researchers examined temperature data for the region and estimates of what might have been experienced over the past decade in a world without human-induced warming. They found that between 2015 and 2024, climate change increased the number of days each country experiences temperature ranges above the ideal for cacao growth by an average of two to four weeks annually. Most of those hotter days came during the main crop cycle, when the plants bloom and produce beans. Warming is also altering rain patterns, accelerating droughts, facilitating the spread of devastating diseases like pod rot, and contributing to soil degradation. Another new study found low rates of pollination and higher-than-average temperatures in Ghana have combined to limit yields.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'In late January, a warning spread through the London-based Facebook group Are We Dating the Same Guy?—but this post wasn’t about a bad date or a cheating ex. A connected network of male-dominated Telegram groups had surfaced, sharing and circulating nonconsensual intimate images of women. Their justification? Retaliation.\\n\\nOn January 23, users in the AWDTSG Facebook group began warning about hidden Telegram groups. Screenshots and TikTok videos surfaced, revealing public Telegram channels where users were sharing nonconsensual intimate images. Further investigation by WIRED identified additional channels linked to the network. By scraping thousands of messages from these groups, it became possible to analyze their content and the patterns of abuse.\\n\\nAWDTSG, a sprawling web of over 150 regional forums across Facebook alone, with roughly 3 million members worldwide, was designed by Paolo Sanchez in 2022 in New York as a space for women to share warnings about predatory men. But its rapid growth made it a target. Critics argue that the format allows unverified accusations to spiral. Some men have responded with at least three defamation lawsuits filed in recent years against members, administrators, and even Meta, Facebook’s parent company. Others took a different route: organized digital harassment.\\n\\nPrimarily using Telegram group data made available through Telemetr.io, a Telegram analytics tool, WIRED analyzed more than 3,500 messages from a Telegram group linked to a larger misogynistic revenge network. Over 24 hours, WIRED observed users systematically tracking, doxing, and degrading women from AWDTSG, circulating nonconsensual images, phone numbers, usernames, and location data.\\n\\nFrom January 26 to 27, the chats became a breeding ground for misogynistic, racist, sexual digital abuse of women, with women of color bearing the brunt of the targeted harassment and abuse. Thousands of users encouraged each other to share nonconsensual intimate images, often referred to as “revenge porn,” and requested and circulated women’s phone numbers, usernames, locations, and other personal identifiers.\\n\\nAs women from AWDTSG began infiltrating the Telegram group, at least one user grew suspicious: “These lot just tryna get back at us for exposing them.”\\n\\nWhen women on Facebook tried to alert others of the risk of doxing and leaks of their intimate content, AWDTSG moderators removed their posts. (The group’s moderators did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) Meanwhile, men who had previously coordinated through their own Facebook groups like “Are We Dating the Same Girl” shifted their operations in late January to Telegram\\'s more permissive environment. Their message was clear: If they can do it, so can we.\\n\\n\"In the eyes of some of these men, this is a necessary act of defense against a kind of hostile feminism that they believe is out to ruin their lives,\" says Carl Miller, cofounder of the Center for the Analysis of Social Media and host of the podcast Kill List.\\n\\nThe dozen Telegram groups that WIRED has identified are part of a broader digital ecosystem often referred to as the manosphere, an online network of forums, influencers, and communities that perpetuate misogynistic ideologies.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'A new age of commercial moon exploration is upon us, and one of the most exciting missions yet is about to launch—one laden with rovers, a drill, and even a hopper spacecraft that will try to “jump” into a permanently dark lunar crater to search for ice.\\n\\nThe IM-2 mission, from Texas-based company Intuitive Machines, is scheduled to launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral in Florida on Wednesday, February 26. The lander, nicknamed Athena and about the size of a car, is partially funded by NASA, as the US space agency attempts to create a new lunar economy that can support upcoming planned human missions to the moon.\\n\\n“NASA and the space industry is creating a new business, getting science and payloads to the surface of the moon,” says Laura Forczyk, founder of the Florida-based space consultancy firm Astralytical. “And these uncrewed missions are preparing us to send humans.”\\n\\nIM-2 is funded by a NASA program called Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS, which started in 2018 under the first Trump administration. The goal was to give money to private companies to build landers to travel to the moon, carrying NASA instruments and other equipment to the lunar surface, ahead of the planned return of humans this decade in the Artemis program. Up to $2.6 billion in funding has been earmarked through 2028, with Intuitive Machines receiving $47 million for this mission.\\n\\nThe CLPS program has had mixed results so far. Its first mission, the Peregrine lander built by the Pennsylvania-based firm Astrobotic, suffered a fuel leak and abandoned its landing attempt in January 2024. The next CLPS mission featured Intuitive Machines’ first lander, IM-1, which landed on its side. “We were able to get some data back, but we don’t want to end up on our side on this mission,” says Trent Martin, senior vice president of space systems at Intuitive Machines.\\n\\nIM-2 will join another CLPS mission at the moon that has already launched, the Blue Ghost lander from Firefly of Texas, which is scheduled to attempt a landing in early March. Blue Ghost is targeting a region in the moon’s northern hemisphere, the Sea of Tranquillity, near where the Apollo 11 mission landed in 1969. IM-2, which will attempt its landing later in March, is targeting the moon’s south pole, a region of arguably greater scientific interest.\\n\\nScientists think there might be ice trapped at the moon’s poles, particularly in permanently shadowed regions, or PSRs. These are craters near the poles that, because of the moon’s tilt towards the sun, never receive sunlight on their insides. Temperatures on the surface of the moon can fluctuate between -150 and 120 degrees Celsius (-250 and 250 degrees Fahrenheit) as it turns from night to daytime over the course of a lunar day (which is about the same length as a month on Earth). However, in PSRs temperatures never rise above -170 degrees Celsius.'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-23T13:30:00',\n",
       "   'content': \"Not only has China’s largest EV maker BYD unveiled good, better, and best tiers for its advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS), it announced last week that the tech—marketed somewhat immodestly as “God’s Eye”—will now be fitted as standard to 21 of BYD’s 30 cars split across four brands.\\n\\nEven the $9,500 Seagull hatchback, the cheapest of BYD’s EVs, will ship with the base level of God’s Eye at no extra cost, while the $233,500 Yangwang U9 electric supercar will get the top-tier iteration. However, BYD’s ADAS system could be as misleadingly named as Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD).\\n\\nIncluding ADAS for free will no doubt rile BYD’s smaller rivals in China’s innovative but cutthroat auto market. Comparatively low-tech Toyota, VW, and Nissan may weaken further, and Tesla—which has yet to gain permission for FSD in China—could also struggle.\\n\\nElon Musk’s auto firm temporarily lost the title of the world’s largest EV maker to BYD last year, and since then competition has been fierce. BYD topped the Chinese market for EVs in January with a 27 percent market share, pushing the previously dominant Tesla down to sixth place on just 4.5 percent.\\n\\nGod’s Eye (an alternative translation is “Eye of Heaven”) relies on various cameras and sensors to assist drivers with valet parking, adaptive cruising, and automated braking. Among other tasks, it can also learn users’ driving habits and supposedly predict the type and skill level of a new driver taking control.\\n\\nCareful not to describe God’s Eye as fully autonomous, BYD’s billionaire founder and CEO Wang Chuanfu boasted during a lavish launch event at the company’s headquarters in Shenzhen last week that intelligent driving capabilities would soon become as ubiquitous as seat belts and airbags.\\n\\nChuanfu then cut to a promotional video showing a U9 spinning a driverless donut at the Hunan Zhuzhou International Circuit before racing around corners at high speed with tires squealing, and at night.\\n\\nGod’s Eye is L2+ ADAS—similar to Tesla’s FSD—and would, therefore, still require supervision from a human driver on a public road. As defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), the stages of automated driving are measured on a scale of 0 to 5, with Level 0 involving no driving automation through to Level 5, which is full automation.\\n\\nL2+, not an SAE-accepted term, is used by automakers to imply progression through the levels. The “plus” part refers to hands-off-the-steering-wheel driving with eyes on the road ahead.\\n\\nPowerful computers in a car equipped with L2+ control can follow a mapped route, make lane changes, and moderate speed in traffic. L2+ keeps the burden of liability with the driver but gives at least the sensation of hands-free driving. Unlike in the US, China’s ADAS rules state that a driver’s hand must always be on the steering wheel.\\n\\nBYD's moniker may suggest its in-house L2+ ADAS is omniscient, but Shanghai-based automotive commentator Mark Rainford of Inside China Auto has test-driven several Chinese L2+ cars, and he is more impressed with Huawei's Qiankun system than God’s Eye. Incidentally, continuing the deification nomenclature, Huawei's own General Obstacle Detection network for autos is also referred to as “GOD.”\"},\n",

       "   'content': 'Ashley Poprik has never been the model for a video game character. As a writer on projects like Spider-Man 2 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, they work on games, not as characters within them. In 2023, however, a cabal of angry gamers was convinced otherwise. They were furious over how Spider-Man 2’s Mary Jane looked; more specifically, they complained, she simply wasn’t hot enough.\\n\\nThe problem, these gamers falsely claimed, was that Poprik—then a writing intern with no ability to change a character’s face, let alone one based on a real-life model—had inserted themself into the game. Gamers concocted this conspiracy based on a photo of the writer, placed side-by-side with Mary Jane; in the photo, Poprik and MJ both sport long hair with a middle part, are smiling, and have a similar face shape.\\n\\nPoprik, who identifies as gender-fluid, describes themself as having androgynous features. “A big narrative spun up that I was a trans woman, and so I was getting hate from any alt-right winger,” they say.\\n\\n“I was getting so many death threats, pictures of decapitated women, and YouTube videos about me that were just straight made-up information,” Poprik says. “It forever changed the way I feel about video games.”\\n\\nEventually, things got so bad that Poprik had to wipe personal information from the internet out of fear for their safety.\\n\\nPoprik has faced months of ongoing online harassment as well as in-person accusations of making things “woke”—especially for features within the games they had no involvement in. Yet in each case, Poprik says, they received no support or security resources from the companies they worked for.\\n\\n“When a marginalized dev is harassed, they’re on their own,” Poprik says.\\n\\nToday, being anything other than a cisgender game developer in the United States is more dangerous than ever. Online, transgender and gender-nonconforming developers become harassment targets at the whims of reactionary grifters railing against anything socially progressive or the result of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts. Offline, President Donald Trump seeks to deny their existence with executive orders aimed at “restoring biological truth to the federal government,” restricting lifesaving health care for minors, and removing trans people from the military.\\n\\nOther executive orders, though, pose a more imminent threat. Trump’s move to eliminate government funding for programs that battle discriminatory practices are already being mimicked by tech companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon. Developers fear their own employers could follow suit. Given that so much of what’s come to be known as “Gamergate 2.0” has focused on gamers railing against real or perceived DEI efforts, these worries don’t seem unfounded.\\n\\nWIRED spoke with seven developers across the industry in workplaces ranging from AAA studios to small, independent companies. Many spoke to us only under the condition of anonymity out of concern for their safety or because they did not have permission to speak to the press on behalf of their companies. (WIRED independently confirmed all their identities and employment.) What emerged was a consistent narrative of fear, stress, and alienation that follows them into the workplace and is thriving in the online culture surrounding video games.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'The widespread layoff of Department of Agriculture scientists has thrown vital research into disarray, according to former and current employees of the agency. Scientists hit by the layoffs were working on projects to improve crops, defend against pests and disease, and understand the climate impact of farming practices. The layoffs also threaten to undermine billions of taxpayer dollars paid to farmers to support conservation practices, experts warn.\\n\\nThe USDA layoffs are part of the Trump administration’s mass firing of federal employees, mainly targeting people who are in their probationary periods ahead of gaining full-time status, which for USDA scientists can be up to three years. The agency has not released exact firing figures, but they are estimated to include many hundreds of staff at critical scientific subagencies and a reported 3,400 employees in the Forest Service.\\n\\nEmployees were told of their firing in a blanket email sent on February 13 and seen by WIRED. “The Agency finds, based on your performance, that you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the Agency would be in the public interest,” the email says.\\n\\nOne laid-off employee described the weeks preceding the firing as “chaos,” as the USDA paused (in response to orders from the Trump administration) and then unpaused (in response to a court order) work connected to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)—the landmark 2022 law passed under President Joe Biden that set aside large amounts of federal money for climate policies. “It was just pause, unpause, pause, unpause. After four or five business days of that, I’m thinking, I literally can’t get anything done,” says the former employee, who worked on IRA-linked projects and asked to remain anonymous to protect them from retribution.\\n\\nThe IRA provided the USDA with $300 million to help with the quantification of carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. This money was intended to support the $8.45 billion in farmer subsidies authorized in the IRA to be spent on the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP)—a plan to encourage farmers to take up practices with potential environmental benefits, such as cover cropping and better waste storage. At least one contracted farming project funded by EQIP has been paused by the Trump administration, Reuters reports.\\n\\nThe $300 million was supposed to be used to establish an agricultural greenhouse gas network that could monitor the effectiveness of the kinds of conservation practices funded by EQIP and other multibillion-dollar conservation programs, says Emily Bass, associate director of federal policy, food, and agriculture at the environmental research center the Breakthrough Institute. This work was being carried out in part by the National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), two of the scientific sub-agencies hit heavily by the federal layoffs.\\n\\nGot a Tip?\\n\\nAre you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what’s happening? We’d like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at mattreynolds.45\\n\\n“That’s a ton of taxpayer dollars, and the quantification work of ARS and NRCS is an essential part of measuring those programs’ actual impacts on emissions reductions,” says Bass. “Stopping or hamstringing efforts midway is a huge waste of resources that have already been spent.”\\n\\nOne current ARS scientist, who spoke to WIRED anonymously, as they were not authorized to talk to the press, claims that at their unit almost 40 percent of scientists have been fired along with multiple support staff. Many of their unit’s projects are now in disarray, the scientist says, including work that has been planned out in five-year cycles and requires close monitoring of plant specimens. “In the short term we can keep that material alive, but we can’t necessarily do that indefinitely if we don’t have anybody on that project.”'},\n",

       "   'content': 'As Usual, The latest round of Nvidia GPUs started with the most expensive and most powerful cards. I was lucky enough to spend some time with the elusive RTX 5080 Founders Edition (8/10, WIRED Recommends) and the practically nonexistent RTX 5090 Founders Edition (7/10, WIRED Recommends), both of which impressed with 60+ frames per second at 4K in a number of major titles. These cards represented premium examples of both GPUs, but they’ve been extremely scarce ever since their release.\\n\\nAs we start to creep further down the budget scale, there are no fancy Founders Edition GPUs to chase after. Instead, a variety of board partners offer more typical card designs, with coolers that you’re likely to recognize from previous years and a spectrum of overclocking levels. That should mean wider availability too, but in practice things haven’t quite played out that way.\\n\\nThe RTX 5070 Ti I have in hand today comes from Asus, and as the Prime variant, it should come in at or close to the GPU’s $749 MSRP—if you can find it. Stock and pricing issues have surrounded the 50 Series launches so far, and this card is no exception. While it performs well for the price point, limited availability and steep aftermarket damage the value proposition.\\n\\nPhotograph: Brad Bourque\\n\\nForm Factor\\n\\nWhile card sizes have swelled in the past few generations, I’m glad to see AIC partners taking a queue from Nvidia’s FE cards and making an effort to shrink back down a bit. The Asus Prime is definitely a 2.5-slot card, but in reality it’s just barely wider than its back metal panel, and it fits just fine in my Hyte Y60 (7/10, WIRED Recommends).\\n\\nIt looks nice enough, with a mix of glossy and matte blacks, cut by clean white lines. It should fit aesthetically in almost any case, but it definitely lacks the refined finish of the first-party Nvidia offerings.\\n\\nPhotograph: Brad Bourque\\n\\nThe new 12V-2x6 connection is here too, and Asus includes an adapter with three six-pin plugs on the other end.

       "   'content': \"Sweeping layoffs architected by the Trump administration and the so-called Department of Government Efficiency may be coming as soon as this week at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a nonregulatory agency responsible for establishing benchmarks that ensure everything from beauty products to quantum computers are safe and reliable.\\n\\nAccording to several current and former employees at NIST, the agency has been bracing for cuts since President Donald Trump took office last month and ordered billionaire Elon Musk and DOGE to slash spending across the federal government. The fears were heightened last week when some NIST workers witnessed a handful of people they believed to be associated with DOGE inside Building 225, which houses the NIST Information Technology Laboratory at the agency’s Gaithersburg, Maryland, campus, according to multiple people briefed on the sightings. The DOGE staff were seeking access to NIST’s IT systems, one of the people said.\\n\\nSoon after the purported visit, NIST leadership told employees that DOGE staffers were not currently on campus, but that office space and technology were being provisioned for them, according to the same people.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Axios and Bloomberg reported that NIST had begun informing some employees that they could soon be laid off. About 500 recent hires who are still in probationary status and can be let go more easily were among those expected to be affected, according to the reports. Three sources tell WIRED that the cuts likely impact lauded technical experts in leadership positions, including three lab directors who were promoted within the last year. One person familiar with the agency tells WIRED that the official layoff notices may come Friday.\\n\\nThe White House and a spokesperson for NIST, which is part of the Department of Commerce, did not yet return requests for comment.\\n\\nOne NIST team that has been fearing cuts because of its number of probationary employees is the US AI Safety Institute (AISI), which was created after former President Joe Biden’s sweeping executive order on AI issued in October 2023. Trump rescinded the order shortly after taking office last month, describing it as a “barrier to American leadership in artificial intelligence.”\\n\\nThe AI Safety Institute and its roughly two dozen staffers have been working closely with AI companies, including rivals to Musk’s startup xAI like OpenAI and Anthropic, to understand and test the capabilities of their most powerful models. Musk was an early investor in OpenAI and is currently suing the startup over its decision to transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit corporation.\\n\\nAISI’s inaugural director, Elizabeth Kelly, announced she was leaving her role earlier this month. Several other high-profile NIST leaders working on AI have also departed in recent weeks, including Reva Schwartz, who led NIST’s Assessing Risks and Impacts of AI program, and Elham Tabassi, NIST’s chief AI adviser. Kelly and Schwartz declined to comment. Tabassi did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at wak.01, peard33.24, and leahfeiger.86.\\n\\nUS vice president JD Vance recently signaled the new administration’s intent to deprioritize AI safety at the AI Action Summit, a major international meeting held in Paris last week that AISI and other government staffers were not invited to attend, according to three familiar with the matter. “I'm not here this morning to talk about AI safety,” Vance said in his first major speech as VP. “I'm here to talk about AI opportunity.”\"},\n",

       "   'content': \"How to Get Started With Barefoot Shoes\\n\\nPhotograph: Masudnpathan/Getty Images\\n\\nYou've probably been wearing padded shoes most of your life. Don't expect to toss them and be able to do the same mileage—whether walking or running—in barefoot shoes. To a certain degree, you must relearn how to run and walk. It's going to take a conscious effort on your part, and it can be very difficult. You're not just learning, you're also unlearning some ingrained habits. The key is to go slow. Very, very, absurdly slow.\\n\\nHow you approach barefoot shoes depends on what you're looking to do. I happened to be getting into running, which worked out nicely because I had to take it slow (I sucked). If you're currently an ultra-marathoner and want to try barefoot shoes, you'll have a hard time holding yourself back. If you're somewhere between those poles, it'll still be hard not to overdo it. Focus the discipline you usually use for distance into not doing distance.\\n\\nIf you don't know where to start, check out Graham Tuttle's YouTube channel, especially his foot strengthening exercises. These will help you develop the foot and ankle strength you lack if you're coming from years of padded shoes, and help reduce muscle soreness when you're getting started in barefoot running. Tuttle also offers some paid programs aimed at giving you a more personalized guide (I have not tried any of these). Another YouTube channel I've found helpful is the MovNat channel, which isn't barefoot-specific but has plenty of good barefoot advice sprinkled throughout its content. And if you haven't read Christopher McDougall, both Born to Run and Natural Born Heroes are fun barefoot-related reads. Indeed, Born to Run arguably did more to popularize barefoot running than anything else since the padded shoe was born in the early 1970s.\\n\\nIt's also worth saying that barefoot shoes are not a zero-sum game. For over a year I wore barefoot shoes running, regular shoes for other tasks, and sandals the rest of the time. It's not all or nothing. If you go on a barefoot run and then slap on your favorite Converse right after, that's OK. It's equally important to know that everyone is different. It took me six months to fully transition to barefoot shoes. But that's just me. It might take you two months or two years. Go at your own pace, and don't worry about the experiences of others.\"},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-22T13:50:00',\n",
       "   'content': 'The nostalgia behind the slogan “Make America great again” has always provoked the obvious questions of just when America was great, and for whom. Early in the second Trump administration, we are getting the answer.\\n\\nIn August, speaking with someone he believed to be a sympathetic donor, one of the Project 2025 architects, Russell Vought, said that a goal of the next Trump administration would be to “get us off of multiculturalism” in America. Now Vought is running Donald Trump’s Office of Management and Budget, and the plan to end multiculturalism is proceeding apace. Much of the chaos, lawlessness, and destruction of the past few weeks can be understood as part of the administration’s central ideological project: restoring America’s traditional hierarchies of race and gender. Call it the “Great Resegregation.”\\n\\nFrom the January/February 2024 issue: Civil rights undone\\n\\nSince taking office, Trump has rescinded decades-old orders ensuring equal opportunity in government contracts and vowed to purge DEI from the federal government, intending to lay off any federal worker whose job they associate with DEI. Yesterday evening, Trump fired the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Charles Q Brown, and replaced him with a lower ranking white official, a retired three-star Air Force officer named Dan Caine. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth had previously attacked Brown as an unqualified diversity hire based on the fact that he is Black. Trump’s Department of Justice has implied that it will prosecute or sue companies that engage in diversity outreach. Elon Musk’s DOGE is attempting to purge federal workers “that protect employees’ civil rights and others that investigate complaints of employment discrimination in the federal workplace,” the Washington Post reported. Colleges and universities are being threatened with defunding for any programming related to DEI, which the free-speech organization PEN America has noted could include “everything from a panel on the Civil Rights Movement to a Lunar New Year celebration.”\\n\\nTrump has also signed executive orders that threaten government funding for scientific research on inequality or on health issues that disproportionately affect nonwhite ethnic groups, and has imposed censorious gag orders that could block discussion of race or sex discrimination in American classrooms. During her confirmation hearing, Trump’s education-secretary nominee, Linda McMahon, said she did not know if schools could lose funding for teaching Black-history classes under the order. The legality of the order over K–12 curricula is unclear, but the chilling effects are real nonetheless.\\n\\nUnder the Trump administration, schools within the Department of Defense system that serve military families—American service members are disproportionately Black and Hispanic—have torn down pictures of Black historical figures and removed books from their libraries on subjects such as race and gender. This record, within a school system entirely under the administration’s control, offers an alarming preview—one in which a historical figure like Harriet Tubman is no longer a welcome subject in educational settings because she was a Black woman.\\n\\nAn OMB memo ordering a federal-funding freeze illustrates the ideological vision behind these decisions. The memo states that the administration seeks to prevent the use of “federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies,” Acting Director Matthew Vaeth wrote. Equal opportunity in employment is described here as “Marxist,” because it affirms what the desegregators see as an unnatural principle: that nonwhite people are equal to white people, that women are equal to men, and that LGBTQ people deserve the same rights as everyone else.\\n\\nIf the Great Resegregation proves successful, it will restore an America past where racial and ethnic minorities were the occasional token presence in an otherwise white-dominated landscape. It would repeal the gains of the civil-rights era in their entirety. What its advocates want is not a restoration of explicit Jim Crow segregation—that would shatter the illusion that their own achievements are based in a color-blind meritocracy. They want an arrangement that perpetuates racial inequality indefinitely while retaining some plausible deniability, a rigged system that maintains a mirage of equal opportunity while maintaining an unofficial racial hierarchy. Like elections in authoritarian countries where the autocrat is always reelected in a landslide, they want a system in which they never risk losing but can still pretend they won fairly.\\n\\nThe battles of the Great Resegregation are now taking place in at least three overlapping arenas. The first is politics, where right-wing legal organizations have succeeded in rolling back many civil-rights-era voting protections; they want to now fully destroy the remaining shreds. The second is education and employment, particularly at elite institutions, such as the media and academia; right-wing legal strategies have been similarly fruitful here in attacking diversity, thanks to the conservative capture of the Supreme Court. The third is popular culture, where conservatives have sought to leverage anger and nostalgia against movies, television, books, and other creative media brought to life by artists of color.\\n\\nThe term DEI, frequently invoked by the Trump administration, functions as a smoke screen. It allows people to think that the Trump administration’s anti-DEI purge is about removing pointless corporate symbolism or sensitivity trainings. Although it is easy to find examples of DEI efforts that are ill-conceived or ill-applied, some conservatives have leveraged those criticisms to pursue a much broader agenda that is really about tearing anti-discrimination laws out at the roots, so that businesses and governments are free to extend or deny opportunities based on race, gender, and sexual orientation if they so choose.\\n\\n“This is really taking us back to a kind of pre-civil-rights-movement vision of America,” Sherrilyn Ifill, the former head of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, told me in an interview last year, before Trump won the 2024 election. “A backlash is a pushback. This is really much more of a demolition effort.”\\n\\nAs the Trump State Department official Darren Beattie wrote, “Competent white men must be put in charge if you want things to work. Unfortunately, our entire national ideology is predicated on coddling the feelings of women and minorities, and demoralizing competent white men.” This analysis is perceptive in the sense that the exact reverse is true—we are now in the second decade of a years-long temper tantrum sparked by the election of Barack Obama—not to mention the failed attempts to elect a woman to succeed him—and the effect it had on the fragile self-esteem of people like Beattie.\\n\\nRead: Is there anything Trump won’t blame on DEI?\\n\\nOther MAGA figureheads have promoted similar ideas. In 2020, the conservative writer Christopher Caldwell published a book arguing that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had revoked “the de jure constitution of 1788, with all the traditional forms of jurisprudential legitimacy and centuries of American culture behind it.” Because of the Civil Rights Act, white people had fallen “asleep thinking of themselves as the people who had built this country and woke up to find themselves occupying the bottom rung of an official hierarchy of races.”\\n\\nCaldwell’s assessment has grown in popularity among prominent conservatives. The right-wing activist Charlie Kirk has described the Civil Rights Act as having “created a beast, and that beast has now turned into an anti-white weapon,” and he has attacked Martin Luther King Jr., Wired reported, as part of a “broader strategy to discredit” King and “the Civil Rights Act.” On his social network, X, the South African–born Musk, who is playing a key role in the Trump administration, regularly promotes scientific racism, the pseudoscientific ideology that holds that race determines individual potential. Some of the staffers Musk has hired to dismantle the enforcement of anti-discrimination laws seem to share those ideological predilections. One DOGE staffer resigned after the Wall Street Journal revealed he maintained a pro-eugenics social media account where “he appeared to have a special dislike for Indian software engineers.” He was reinstated after receiving public support from Trump and Vance. The problem conservatives trying to undermine anti-discrimination law seem to have with an “official hierarchy of races” is not that one exists but that, in their warped conception, white people are not on top, as they should be.\\n\\nThis ideology is apparent in the rote blaming of diversity by some conservatives for every catastrophic event—as they did following a midair collision over the Potomac River. Or a freighter crashing into a bridge in Baltimore. Or doors flying off Boeing planes.The contention, overt or implied, is always that unlike white men, whose competence can be assumed, the non-white people with desirable jobs are undeserving. The irony, of course, is that many of the white men making these assumptions are themselves unqualified. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is best-known for being a reality-television star.\\n\\nEven so, the Great Resegregation seeks not a return to the explicit racial separation of Jim Crow, but rather an embrace of ostensibly “color-blind” policies intended to sustain a de facto segregation that is more durable and less overt, one in which Black access to the middle and elite strata of American life will be ever more rare and fleeting. The numbers of Black doctors, lawyers, scientists, architects, showrunners, and generals would no longer rise. And there would be no more Black presidents. The real but fragile advancement of the Black poor into the Black middle class would be stalled or reversed. Most Black people would be confined to, as Trump memorably put it, the menial “Black jobs” they were meant for, save for those willing to sustain the self-serving fiction that they are among the good ones.\\n\\nThe demolition of multiracial democracy began a dozen years ago, when the Supreme Court’s conservative majority rolled back voting-rights protections adopted in the 1960s to enforce the rights enshrined in the Fifteenth Amendment. Those protections made America, for the first time, a democracy for all its citizens. They diversified Congress, and led to the election of the first Black president. The Roberts Court has steadily eroded those protections, insisting that they are no longer necessary, even as racist ideas once considered beyond the pale return to the mainstream. These changes have had the predictable outcome of increasing racial disparities in voting.\\n\\nThe Roberts Court has treated policies meant to rectify racial discrimination as themselves racist. The Court shut down what remained of public-school integration efforts. It overturned affirmative action in higher education. These decisions have eroded diversity in the classroom. But they’re just the beginning for the resegregators, who intend to ensure that America’s traditional racial hierarchies are persistent and stable.\\n\\nOne clear example comes in the world of higher education. Because giving all Americans equal access to elite higher education is a step toward broader societal integration, such efforts must be shut down. To this end, conservative groups are suing colleges even in states such as California, where affirmative action in public universities has long been banned, claiming that the fact that their incoming classes have become more diverse rather than less is evidence of reverse discrimination. At least two conservative justices have objected to color-blind, class-based affirmative-action programs. This approach suggests a topsy-turvy understanding of racial discrimination, in which a diverse classroom is one in which white men have been discriminated against, based on the conviction that white men are by definition the most competent possible candidates.\\n\\nRead: Donald Trump is very busy\\n\\nWhen Trump officials speak of a society that is color-blind and merit-based, they do not appear to mean meritocracy or color-blindness in the traditional sense. Instead of individual meritocracy, they seem to be advocating a racial meritocracy, in which the merit of an individual hire or admission can be assessed not by their individual accomplishments but by how well the group they are associated with fits a particular role. In this way, the Great Resegregation seeks firmer moral ground than the racial apartheid of the past. Racial disparities can be framed not as the result of discrimination, but as a fact: that white people are just better and more qualified. And by withholding federal funding from places that engage in scientific inquiry on social inequalities or offer historical instruction that could be seen as portraying America as “fundamentally racist, sexist, or otherwise discriminatory,” the Trump administration can make the causes of those inequalities illegible.\\n\\nWhat the proponents of the Great Resegregation seek is a counterrevolution not merely in law, but also in culture. The civil-rights revolution of the 1960s changed hearts and minds as well as laws, and one of those changes was that racially exclusive institutions became morally suspect. Notably, Trump officials are not willing to state their aims explicitly; they feel obligated to pay lip service to ideals of color-blind meritocracy and mislead about their intentions.\\n\\n“My view is that the diversity ethos has really sunk deep roots,” the Harvard Law professor Randall Kennedy told me. “There are a lot of people across a wide variety of ideological positions who would not like a racially homogeneous, all-white outfit. Even people who say they’re against affirmative action, they would feel somewhat nervous or somewhat embarrassed or somewhat guilty about that.” Trumpists seek to not just repeal protections against discrimination, but reverse the “diversity ethos” that has enabled America’s tenuous strides toward equality.\\n\\nAnd that progress is not only fragile but remarkably incomplete. Neither schools nor workplaces have ever been particularly integrated. Public-school integration stalled long ago. Even prior to the Supreme Court’s decision outlawing affirmative action in admissions, enrollment of Black and Hispanic students at elite universities had stalled at percentages far below their share of the student-age population. Occupational segregation has remained stagnant since the ’90s. Black workers with or without college degrees are concentrated in professions that pay less than those of their white counterparts, despite a rise in Black people obtaining college degrees. Corporate DEI efforts never made much progress on integration to begin with, in part because many of these efforts were more about branding and limiting liability than equal opportunity, and now the federal government will be dead set on reversing whatever headway was made.\\n\\n“The segregation we see in the labor market right now is three to five times worse than we would expect if race wasn’t a core factor,” Justin Heck of Opportunity@Work, an organization that advocates for workers without college degrees, told me. “We’ve seen it go down a little bit in the years leading up to 1990. But the current world looks the same as it did in 1990. It’s been stagnant or worse, or slightly worse today.” Heck is one of the authors of a 2023 study on occupational segregation published by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\\n\\nThere are perhaps two exceptions. One is the federal government, where until now, anti-discrimination laws have been strictly enforced. Trump’s cronies have tried to discredit the federal workforce precisely because it is often more meritocratic, and therefore more integrated than the private sector. “It’s harder in a federal-government job to get a position simply through an informal network,” the political scientist Ashley Jardina, who also worked on the NBER study, told me. “Whereas in the private sector, especially in building trades, for example, a lot of people are getting their jobs through their social networks, which are incredibly segregated.”\\n\\nThat is why Trumpists are so focused on “ending DEI” in the federal workforce. They see anti-discrimination and inclusion as a ladder of upward mobility for people they do not believe should have one. Under Trump, a workplace or college that is perceived as too diverse might come under legal scrutiny, effectively enforcing racial quotas. For example, Andrew Bailey, the attorney general of Missouri, is suing the coffee chain Starbucks on the basis that after adopting DEI programs its workforce has become “more female and less white.”\\n\\nThe second place where America has grown more integrated is media and entertainment, arenas highly visible to the public. This has depreciated the value of what W. E. B. Du Bois called the “psychological wage” of white racial identity—making those who once held an unquestioned hegemony over American culture feel like something has been stolen from them. And this shift helped fuel the nationwide backlash to diversity efforts that Trump rode to office.\\n\\nW. E. B. Du Bois: Strivings of the Negro people\\n\\nThe slight but substantive integration of characters in film, television, and other forms of entertainment has itself led to a visible backlash, subjecting actors, writers, and other creative workers of color to harassment whenever they participate in a high-profile project, especially in the genres of science fiction or fantasy. An integrated cast, writers’ room, or development team is deemed “woke,” by which critics simply mean integrated, and therefore suspect. A woman, LGBTQ person, or person of color in a leading role is deemed unqualified, or worthy of rejection just because of who they are. What may seem like silly internet controversies are in fact demands for a resegregation of creative workplaces.\\n\\n“I think probably part of why we observe more integration in some spaces and others also just has a lot to do with the demands that capitalism places on having a market,” Jardina told me. “It earns money for media organizations and studios to diversify their shows and their casts, because there’s a market for that, in the same way that there isn’t in a lot of industries.”\\n\\nIn other words, the exceptions to America’s persistent segregation have taken place in America’s most public-facing professions, among those assigned to interpret the world around them. What people consuming American media see, for the most part, is a mirage of a more integrated America that has yet to come into being. In virtually every other arena—the private-sector workplace, housing, schooling—America remains profoundly segregated, with opportunities limited by class and race.\\n\\nThis is why Trump’s funding freeze has targeted DEI despite no evidence that the government has lowered its standards on behalf of women and minorities. Asked to provide a real example of lowered standards in the military during his confirmation hearings, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was unable to. The U.S. military has long led the way in demonstrating how a diverse workforce yields American excellence—one reason some conservatives are fixated on its relative egalitarianism, which they deride as “wokeness.” Hegseth recently said he believed that “the single dumbest phrase in military history is our diversity is our strength.\" The Nazis and Confederates learned otherwise.\\n\\nOf course he himself is an illustration of lowered standards—Hegseth has no demonstrable expertise for the job he was given—but because he is a white man, his qualifications for the job are assumed, as a result of the Trumpist concept of racial meritocracy. This is why the funding freeze is targeting research on inequality. It is why private companies are threatened with government lawsuits and prosecutions if they seek a broader pool of applicants. It is why the Trump administration’s deportations do not target merely undocumented criminals but also immigrants on Temporary Protective Status. It is why Trump’s loyalists are dismantling any and all government programs that might conceivably even the playing field between those born with plenty and those born with little.\\n\\nFor all the big talk about putting an end to “social engineering,” the Great Resegregation is itself a radical attempt to socially engineer America to be poorer, whiter, less equal, and less democratic. Much as the old Jim Crow measures kept many southern white people impoverished and disenfranchised alongside the Black southerners they targeted, the Great Resegregation will leave wealthy white elites with a firmer grip on power and the working classes with fewer opportunities and a weakened social safety net. The only people left with more will be those who already had more than they needed to begin with.'},\n",

Education is often touted as a tool of social mobility meant to help students access well-paying jobs, but these curricula battles indicate that many adults view it as a tool for inculcating future citizens with a particular viewpoint.\\n\\nHow can an institution that carries so much of our collective expectation to equalize mankind also bear some of the marks of an indoctrination factory? On today’s episode of Good on Paper, I speak with Agustina Paglayan, a professor of political science at UC San Diego whose new book, Raised to Obey: The Rise and Spread of Mass Education, conducts a rigorous historical analysis of why public education spread.\\n\\n“The expansion of primary education in the West was driven not by democratic ideals, but by the state’s desire to control citizens,” Paglayan argues. “And to control them by targeting children at an age when they are very young and susceptible to external influence and to teach them at that young age that it’s good to respect rules, that it’s good to respect authority.”\\n\\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\\n\\n[Music]\\n\\nJerusalem Demsas: You’ve probably heard the name Horace Mann. He was a 19th-century reformer who championed the abolition of slavery, the rights of women, and, most famously, the American public-school system.\\n\\nAs Adam Harris wrote for The Atlantic, Mann “sought to mold a certain kind of student: conscientious, zealous, inquisitive.”\\n\\nAgustina Paglayan would probably add another word: obedient. Agustina is a political scientist at UC San Diego. Her new book, Raised to Obey: The Rise and Spread of Mass Education, argues that the roots of the world’s modern education systems were based not on progressive ideals but on a desire to suppress unruly populations.\\n\\nMy name’s Jerusalem Demsas. I’m a staff writer at The Atlantic, and this is Good on Paper, a policy show that questions what we really know about popular narratives.\\n\\nPublic education is largely seen as a progressive enterprise meant to provide opportunities to those who could not afford an education on their own, but its roots may have been anything but. Beginning with Prussia in the mid-1700s, Agustina looks at the curious timing of when countries invest in their education systems and finds that investment comes in response to political elites witnessing threats to their political power.\\n\\nI still believe that public education, as Horace Mann put it, can be the great equalizer of the conditions of man. But after reading Agustina’s book, I’m not sure policy makers were seeking to make it so. And troublingly, modern reformers may be more interested in indoctrination than education.\\n\\nAgustina, welcome to the show.\\n\\nAgustina Paglayan: Thank you very much, Jerusalem. I’m very happy to be here.\\n\\nDemsas: Happy to have you. So every single time I have a conversation with someone about education policy, whether on this show or in real life, I’m sort of struck by the selection-effect issues of having education conversations with policy makers and policy wonks, because, almost universally, they’re people who liked school and liked learning, and they’re people who probably, in some ways, thrived or at least managed to overcome difficulties that they had in school.\\n\\nAnd then they’re the people who then go on to have these conversations about, What’s wrong with schools these days? and, What’s going on here? I was one of those weird kids who would get FOMO about sick days. (Laughs.) I assume that you’re also in this class of people. You have a Ph.D. and, I guess, never quit school. Do you think about how your relationship to education affects your research?\\n\\nPaglayan: Absolutely. I always think not just about how my personal experience but everyone’s personal experience shapes their research. I will say your intuition is correct.\\n\\nI was a straight-A student all along. But I also had, for better or worse, the benefit of having many siblings, some of whom dropped out of high school. And so within the confines of my family, I had exposure to those inequalities that we see in society more broadly. And that inequality that I observed, even within my family, was something that was always a source of curiosity for me, particularly, as you were saying, you and I—we were straight-A students.\\n\\nDemsas: Not straight-A, but I won’t co-opt that. I liked school. (Laughs.)\\n\\nPaglayan: Okay. And I didn’t need much support to do that. But what I saw was that some of my siblings who needed more support from school in order to do well—they weren’t getting that support. And so that was always something that was a little troubling for me to try to understand: Why is it that those who get more easily distracted, those who maybe have more behavioral problems or more difficulty concentrating, they’re not getting the support they need? That’s what schools are supposed to do and who they are supposed to be helping the most. At least, that’s what I grew up thinking.\\n\\nAnd so that always was at the heart of my interest in education. I mean, the other really relevant piece of what drove me to study education, in terms of my personal experience, is just that I grew up in a family where education was the most important thing. And my mom, in particular—she sacrificed a lot to be able to afford one of the best schools in Argentina, which is the country where I grew up. We didn’t have health insurance for a while. There were a lot of different things that she sacrificed along the way. And so I grew up with this sense that education is the most important investment you can make in order to live a life that is not just a prosperous life but a life with individual autonomy, where you can pursue your dreams, if you want.\\n\\nAnd then what I started seeing as I started working on education—I worked both at the World Bank, helping with education reform in different countries, and also at Stanford University Center for Education Policy Analysis—as I started getting to know more about education systems, I started noticing, well, we have these ideas about how education is supposed to be about improving living standards, promoting individual autonomy, etcetera. But education systems worldwide are not living up to that promise.\\n\\nAnd so that was also something that led me to be further interested in education systems and figuring out this puzzle, which began as a family-specific puzzle, but then I started observing these broader patterns cross-nationally.\\n\\nDemsas: Do you still believe that education holds all those values that you did growing up?\\n\\nPaglayan: I think education certainly has the promise to accomplish that. I don’t think education systems were designed to accomplish that, and I think that’s a big part of the explanation why they don’t live up to that promise.\\n\\nDemsas: I want to situate us in the history of the rise of state-led primary education. Before reading your book, I think I hadn’t really taken in the short timeline that we’re talking about here, just over the course of, like, 200 years. I’m hoping you can talk to us—like, when did this start? Where did it start? Give us sort of a historical grounding.\\n\\nPaglayan: Yes. So you’re right. This is a 200-year history—very short in human history. Historically, what we had was that the education of children was left entirely to families and churches. And it’s in 1763 that Prussia became the first country in the world to create a compulsory primary-education system.\\n\\nAnd that sort of is the first instance of a state-regulated primary-education system. And Prussia, in that time period, also happens to transition from being a backward economy to being one of the most developed and, particularly, a military and world power. And so there are many countries around the world who are trying to figure out: What did Prussia do? How did Prussia accomplish this major transformation?\\n\\nAnd what they observed as they traveled to Prussia—and you have people from all over, from Horace Mann traveling to Prussia, to the education reformers in Latin American and in France and other parts of Europe—and what they observe when they go to Prussia is, well, the one thing Prussia has that no one else has is this primary-compulsory-education system. And so that sets off a set of reforms in other countries or, at least, debates about how, if you have a primary-education system, you can consolidate political authority if it is the government that’s in charge of regulating what’s being taught in schools and then using that regulation to ensure that children are being taught to obey the state and obey its laws.\\n\\nBut as I pointed out, it began in 1763. I would mark that as a really important date with Prussia. And then what you see progressively is the U.S. and Canada and continental Europe following Prussia successively at different points in time, followed by Latin America toward the end of the 19th century. And then much later, you see Asian and African countries sort of following suit. So the timing of the different countries varies in terms of when they push for primary education. And that’s one of the things that I examine in the book, is, Well, why are they doing it when they are doing it?\\n\\nDemsas: How did parents react to this? It seems pretty rapid, over the course of maybe a generation, where you’re not expected to have any kind of regular interaction with state institutions, to, all of a sudden, You need to send your 5-year-old to a state-run public school. How do they react to that?\\n\\nPaglayan: We don’t have a lot of evidence on how parents directly reacted. What we do have evidence on is what politicians perceived was the parents’ reaction. And the perception that politicians had was primarily that parents really did not like this, because the schools weren’t teaching their kids anything that was particularly useful. And those children were used to contributing to the household income. They worked in farms. They worked in factories. And so, suddenly, you were withdrawing a form of labor that contributed to the family’s economy.\\n\\nAnd so the parents resisted that at first. Or at least, again, that was the perception that governments had, that there was this resistance. And that’s why, then, governments passed compulsory-schooling laws, to say, Okay, even if you don’t like it, you need to send your children to school, because we have this project that we want to carry out.\\n\\nDemsas: I know we’re talking in generalities now, and I know from reading your book, you’ve collected a lot of data to be able to speak in these averages, and there’s a ton of heterogeneity that’s underlying a lot of this that I’m just going to pin for our listeners here.\\n\\nBut in general, when we’re talking about compulsory public education, are you saying that these states would send police officers to require that? Would they levy fines? How much state capacity did they really have to require this? Or was it just that people kind of just follow the law for other reasons?\\n\\nPaglayan: So as you pointed out, one of the things that I document in the book is the different sets of penalties and provisions that were put in the law to encourage parents to comply with compulsory-schooling provisions. And so in some countries, what you had was the threat of fines, and sometimes it’s just the threat itself that was sufficient to encourage low-income parents to send their kids to school. You didn’t have to really have everyone fined. It was just the existence of those fines.\\n\\nIt was the creation of school inspectorate systems that was very heavily in charge of monitoring school attendance. So states also created this monitoring tool through hiring and deploying school inspectors to monitor whether children were attending school and identify parents who were not complying. So this system in and of itself was something that encouraged parents.\\n\\nAnd then the other thing that was also used was not just fines but, for example, in the context of Prussia, if you wanted to get religious confirmation, you had to send your kid to school. Otherwise, they couldn’t get their religious confirmation. And so that was another way to induce parents.\\n\\nDemsas: So you mentioned this before, but the question under investigation is: Why did the west lead in expanding mass primary education? What were the reasons for that expansion and the motivations underlying that shift? Before we get into your explanation, I want to run through the traditional theories and talk them through, and talk through how you were able to discard those with your research.\\n\\nYou mentioned a few of them in your book: democratization, industrialization, interstate wars, assimilation of immigrants. Can you walk us through these theories and why you don’t see them holding water?\\n\\nPaglayan: Yes, so all of the theories that you just mentioned, I examine in the book, and I rule out only after looking at the evidence. And so let me start with democratization.\\n\\nSo there was a big literature that argued that the expansion of primary education in the west, and around the world, was driven by the spread of democracy—that once lower-income people became enfranchised, they wanted primary education, and governments, who now needed to win elections with votes from lower-income individuals, responded by expanding primary education.\\n\\nAnd so to test this theory, one of the things that I did was to compile information about when governments began to regulate primary education. And also, how much access to primary education was there prior to a country becoming democratic for the first time?\\n\\nAnd so the two things that I found there was, first, that the creation of state-regulated primary-education systems (as defined by the passage of the first primary-education law that regulates the curriculum, regulates when you need to attend school, regulates who can become a teacher, all of these things that are regulated by these primary-education laws), these laws are passed well before a country transitions to democracy for the first time—on average, a hundred years before. So that’s the first piece of evidence to rule out the democracy argument.\\n\\nDemsas: And what’s your data sample? What countries are you looking at, and are you just independently doing all this research, or are there data sets that already exist?\\n\\nPaglayan: No.\\n\\nDemsas: Oh, wow.\\n\\nPaglayan: Yeah. I did all of the information gathering. So I started with Europe and the Americas, and I used a collection of roughly 80 different books, dissertations, and secondary sources, primarily to locate the year when these laws were passed and then to locate the actual laws, because the book also analyzes the content of the laws, the curriculum, the teacher training-and-recruitment policies, and so on. But I started with the secondary sources first, and sometimes there’s discrepancies, so you have to sort of figure out who’s correct here.\\n\\nDemsas: A big theme of the show is just how laborious all data collection actually is and how it’s the main part of most research. (Laughs.)\\n\\nPaglayan: Yeah, it takes a little bit of an obsessive personality to enjoy the task, actually.\\n\\nDemsas: So essentially, you’re plotting this first year as, like, Year Zero and then also plotting at what year democratization happens and seeing whether those things are actually happening one after the other. And you just don’t see any relationship at all?\\n\\nPaglayan: Well, the relationship you see is that it happens way before democracy. And then the other thing that I also look at is, Okay, maybe they just passed laws, but they didn’t do much in the form of providing primary education to people. This was just paper but not much in the form of implementation.\\n\\nAnd so to get at whether that was the case, the other thing that I did was to construct a data set with primary-school enrollment rates for European and Latin American countries going very far back in time, farther back than any other previously existing data set. And what I looked at is, Okay, when you get to a country’s first transition to democracy, what was the prior level of enrollment in primary education? Are we talking 20 percent? Are we talking 30 percent? And no, we’re talking an average 70 percent enrollment. So enrollment in primary education was already very high prior to democratization.\\n\\nAnd the other thing that I also find—and this isn’t in the book; it’s in a separate article that I published—is that democratization itself didn’t lead to further increases in primary education. And this is totally consistent with theories that argue that democracy responds to a majority of people. Well, a majority of people already had access to primary education, so they didn’t want a further expansion. And you don’t see, therefore, democracy expanding primary education further, even if you still have 30 percent or 40 percent of people in some countries left out of primary education.\\n\\nDemocratization doesn’t do much. And the origins of primary education are nondemocratic origins. They preceded the arrival of democracy. So that’s one piece of evidence that the book provides.\\n\\nThe other argument is on industrialization. So here, the argument was that the transition from an agrarian to an industrial economy created a need for skilled and docile workers. And industrialists themselves were demanding that the state create this docile and skilled workforce by setting up primary school systems. And this isn’t something that I have studied on my own. There are other people who’ve studied this, and I build on their work, and some of the primary sources that I collect are consistent with these arguments. The first thing you notice is that industrialists often opposed, at first, the expansion of primary education by the state.\\n\\nDemsas: You’re taking away their workers.\\n\\nPaglayan: Exactly. [It’s] for the same reason that the parents opposed it. Children were working, and industrialists thought, Yeah, you’re taking away our workers. That’s going to reduce the size of the workforce, and that’s going to increase salaries, so we don’t want that.\\n\\nThe other thing is the timing of industrialization versus the timing, again, of these laws that are passed. And you don’t see a consistent pattern of industrialization or the beginning of industrialization preceding the creation of these systems. I think a nice example is the contrasting experiences of Prussia and England. So Prussia created, as we were talking about earlier, the first compulsory primary-education system regulated by the state while it was an agrarian country. And on the flip side to that is that England, which was the leader of the Industrial Revolution, was one of the last countries in all of Europe to create a primary-education system. By 1850, England was the country in Europe with the lowest level of access to primary schooling, even though you had already had almost an entire century of industrialization.\\n\\nDemsas: Okay, so we’ve run through democratization and industrialization, and then there’s also interstate wars.\\n\\nPaglayan: Yes, so interstate wars is, again, an argument people have made that countries developed their primary-education systems in response to military competition and, in the context of that military competition, a desire to form a large, trained, and loyal army—and also to inoculate citizens from external invasion or attempts to capture the country’s territory. So the idea is, Well, if I teach you to be patriotic, and a foreign power comes and tries to seduce you, well, I’ve taught you to be patriotic, and you’re not gonna be seduced by those attempts.\\n\\nAnd again, the evidence, if you look at what happens with access to primary education after interstate wars, you are seeing that the occurrence of interstate wars leads to an expansion of access to primary education, which is what you would expect if interstate-war arguments were correct. You don’t see that.\\n\\nWhat you see in the western world is that during interstate wars, there is a big drop in enrollment, and after the end of the interstate war, there is a recovery but not new expansion of enrollment. It’s just a partial recovery of the drop that took place during the period of the interstate war.\\n\\nDemsas: Largely, what you have done in falsifying the democratization, the industrialization, the interstate wars—and also, you talk about the idea that assimilating immigrants also does not fit with the timing. Like, you don’t see large waves of immigration coincide with the creation of expanding primary education to the masses. Largely, your objections are with ones of timing, and those are ones I think are really easy to grasp.\\n\\nBut with democratization, I have a harder time buying that you can pinpoint exactly when that begins. Of course, as you know, democratization is not a simple, binary yes or no. It’s a process that happens and exists even within very autocratic regimes. Amartya Sen had a very famous and provocative argument that democracy is a universal value. And he points to various historical examples of democratic deliberation and norms around public reason outside of the normal Greek, western tradition throughout history.\\n\\nObviously, that doesn’t prove anything about whether democratization causes education, but it makes me less certain about our ability to say, Democratization does not play a significant role in pushing for more education, because it’s possible that there were just natural reactions to the fact that people were demanding more things, or there were riots happening all the time, and that creates a response within the state to provide educational resources.\\n\\nPaglayan: Right. So I think you’re absolutely right that you could have, even within the context of a regime that is still a nondemocratic regime, a response to the masses that is driven by what we would consider relatively democratic ideals. And in order to get at whether that’s what’s going on, one of the key things that we need to do—one that I do as part of the book—is to look at: What are the political arguments that are being used by politicians when they are choosing and defending the creation of primary-education systems?\\n\\nAnd so if there was an effort to address societal demands, what you would see is that kind of language. And you don’t see that. You see language along the lines of, The masses don’t want to send their children to school, but this is something that’s going to be beneficial for the state for its own sake, for its stability and the consolidation of political authority. And so we’re going to create these systems. We’re going to force parents to send their kids to school, even if they don’t like it.\\n\\nSo you don’t see this demand. And likewise, one of the things that I look at is: Are civil wars, then, leading to an expansion of primary education? Because civil wars or, as you said, riots, rebellions—there are different types of internal conflicts that I discuss in the book. Are these episodes of internal conflict leading to an expansion of education because people are asking for it? And that’s maybe part of the reason why they’re rebelling, is they want an improvement in their living standards.\\n\\nWell, when you look at what politicians are saying after these episodes, and they’re talking about, Okay, what’s the goal of education? it’s not to improve living standards. It’s to teach obedience, to teach submissiveness to the state’s authority. And so it’s in the arguments that are being made by political elites who are setting up these systems, and it’s in the content of the laws themselves, also—What is the curriculum that’s being taught? How are the teachers being trained? and so on and so forth—that you see that the intention is not driven by democratic ideals. I think that’s the collection of evidence, in my view, that helps realize that there’s an authoritarian route in education systems.\\n\\n[Music]\\n\\nDemsas: After the break: the real roots of western education, according to Augustina.\\n\\n[Break]\\n\\nDemsas: So I think it’s a good time for you to give us your thesis, because I do think there’s a pretty-convincing refutation of many of these traditional explanations, and people are probably left wanting more now.\\n\\nPaglayan: Sure. So what the book argues, essentially, is that the expansion of primary education in the west was driven not by democratic ideals but by the state’s desire to control citizens and to control them by targeting children at an age when they are very young and susceptible to external influence, and to teach them at that young age that it’s good to respect rules, that it’s good to respect authority—with the idea in mind that if you learn to respect rules and authority from that young age, you’re going to continue doing so for the rest of your life, and that’s going to lead to political and social stability and, in particular, the stability of the status quo, from which these political elites who are using primary education benefit from.\\n\\nSo that it’s essentially a social-control argument about the origins of primary education and an indoctrination argument about the origins of these western primary-education systems. And by indoctrination, I do want to clarify that I’m following the definition from the dictionary, because the term indoctrination has all kinds of connotations, especially in the United States. But the dictionary defines indoctrination as the process of teaching someone to accept a set of beliefs uncritically.\\n\\nAnd so from that standpoint, you can teach someone to accept, uncritically, that an absolutist regime is the best thing that could happen to you. Or you could also teach someone to accept, uncritically, that democracy or republican institutions are the best form of government.\\n\\nAnd what makes it indoctrination is not the content of what’s being taught. It’s that the process of teaching these beliefs occurs without allowing, or much less encouraging, critical thinking. There’s no room for students to question, Oh, but why are you saying that republican institutions or absolutist regimes are the best way to structure political life? So there’s this emphasis on using education to instill a set of beliefs about: These are the existing political rules. This is how society is led by the state, and you should accept that as the right thing.\\n\\nThe other core argument of the book is about when exactly governments are likely to turn to education for this indoctrination and social-control and instilling obedience purposes. And that’s another key part of the book, which is to show what we were talking about earlier, that these efforts to use education as a form of indoctrination are particularly likely to intensify when political elites experience social unrest and mass protest against the status quo that these elites benefit from.\\n\\nSo these episodes of mass violence against the status quo generate a lot of fear among political elites who benefit from that status quo. And that fear is what leads political elites to then forge a coalition that supports, Okay, let’s invest in primary education, because clearly what we’ve been doing so far, whether it’s repression or trying to appease people with material concessions—that’s not sufficient. We just had this mass revolt or rebellion or insurrection or protest, etcetera. That tells us that what we’ve been doing is not sufficient. We need to do something new. And that’s when they either choose to invest for the first time in primary education or reform the existing education system that they have to better tailor it to the goal of obedience.\\n\\nDemsas: Your book is called Raised to Obey. It’s a great title, and it’s also, I think, a very apt, succinct way of describing your thesis here. But I think that the natural question that rises is, you know: There is a desire to repress the peasantry and the citizenry of countries that have largely been authoritarian for hundreds of years. What changed about the capacity or the tools that they were using in advance that made compulsory education necessary to repress the masses? Because I can imagine someone listening to this and going, Okay, so it’s another tool in order to maintain social order, but isn’t there something interesting about the fact that it all kind of just develops in a short, 200-year time span?\\n\\nPaglayan: Yes, and what happens is the Enlightenment. We have sort of this myth that the Enlightenment promoted ideas of individual autonomy and using reason to make decisions, as opposed to superstition or religion. And there’s a lot of truth in that, but during the Enlightenment, conversation and ideas that circulated around mass education, specifically, which is distinct from education for elites—the idea that took form during the Enlightenment on mass education was that mass education could be used by states to instill obedience and to consolidate the authority of the state.\\n\\nAnd so what you see is this moment of change in ideas. It’s sort of a new idea that emerges that We didn’t have, before, any notion that the state could or should be involved in the education of children. And its people like Hobbes and Locke and Rousseau and Voltaire and Kant who are saying, Well, the state has an interest of its own to educate children so that they will learn to obey the sovereign and its laws. And you get kind of these ideas in the 18th century or so becoming very pervasive in terms of circulating among elites.\\n\\nNow, the ideas on their own are not sufficient for then political rulers to implement those ideas. And that’s where the role of internal conflict and social protest against the status quo becomes a catalyst for elites to say, Oh, okay. We’ve heard that maybe we could use mass education to instill obedience, but we know that’s a costly endeavor. We have to hire a lot of teachers.\\n\\nSo they only agree to turn to education after they experience a situation that tells them, Okay, the tools you’ve been using—repression, material concessions—those are no longer sufficient. And so that diagnosis is what then leads them to education. But you’re right that this is based on a necessary condition, which is the existence of these ideas, which occur primarily around the Enlightenment.\\n\\nDemsas: Talk to me a little bit about your evidence for this here. I know you’ve talked a little bit about the research you’ve done into how elites were talking about creating public-education systems. But I assume that there were many instances of upheaval that were happening throughout hundreds of years of human history, and even over the course of this time period that we’re talking about here, when the Enlightenment ideas were in place. There were many instances of upheaval happening and concerns from elites that they were maybe losing power.\\n\\nBut not all of these countries choose to engage in expansion of primary-education systems after every single one of these things. So is there something particular about the upheavals or the rebellions that cause elites to change their minds here? Are you able to kind of code all of the specific types of rebellions that occur? How do we know that these things are causal?\\n\\nPaglayan: So there are three different things that I want to say in response to this question, which was at the heart of my concern in studying how these instances of upheaval affect or not affect education efforts by the state.\\n\\nSo one of the core concerns is, as a social scientist, you don’t want to start cherry-picking the upheavals that do lead to the expansion of primary education, because that’s just like, Yeah, you’re cherry-picking the cases that meet your theory or support your theory, but there could be all these other upheavals that also take place that don’t lead to education reform.\\n\\nAnd so what I did to get around that issue of cherry-picking is just use civil wars as a way of testing systematically whether one type of internal conflict that has been coded by other social scientists, its timing, and has been coded across countries over time for centuries—whether that type of internal conflict is associated with an expansion of primary education.\\n\\nAnd that’s what I find, is that when you look at civil wars and expansion of primary education, both before and after a civil war, what you see is that in countries that experienced a civil war, there is a rapid acceleration of primary education following the civil war that you don’t observe in countries that in the same time period did not experience a civil war. So the civil war is leading to further expansion of primary education above and beyond what you would expect in the absence of civil war. And so that’s one of the pieces of evidence that the book provides.\\n\\nThere’s also specific cases that I look at that are not using nationally aggregated data but subnational data to further look at this argument. So in the context, for instance, of thinking about the case of France or the case of Chile or the case of Argentina, what I also examine is: When you have a form of internal conflict that is followed by an education reform, is the implementation of that education reform and the construction of schools being targeted specially to those areas that are perceived by the government to constitute a threat to its social order and stability?\\n\\nAnd so, again, that’s another piece of evidence that I find, that yes, indeed, what you’re seeing in the aftermath of these episodes of social conflict involving mass violence against the status quo is that the state not only decides to create a national primary-education system and expand access to primary education, but it’s particularly targeting or specially targeting the expansion of primary education to those areas where the rebels had rebelled against the status quo.\\n\\nAnd then this brings us back to your question: Well, but maybe it’s doing that because the rebels were asking for education or asking for an improvement in their living conditions. And they’re responding by providing education for that reason, not for social control. Which is then why I have to look at, Okay, is that what the education system is designed to accomplish? And it’s not.\\n\\nAnd then the other thing that I discuss in the book considerably is: Not all kinds of internal conflict are likely to lead to the expansion of education for indoctrination purposes. So if you think, for example, of the context of England, one of the things that I talk about in the book is that England did have episodes of political instability. You had civil wars in the 17th century. You had mass strikes in the 19th century.\\n\\nBut what you have in the context of England is that—while these ideas of the Enlightenment that circulated in Prussia and continental Europe, around, States should use education for consolidating authority by instilling obedience in future citizens—in England, the ideas that exist about mass education are different. And people in England have more of a concern that if you educate people, that’s going to lead them to be more empowered and to become more rebellious, if anything.\\n\\nAnd so one of the things that the book says is that for episodes of social unrest to lead to mass-education efforts for indoctrination purposes, well, elites have to believe that education can indeed indoctrinate people. If elites believe that education is going to empower them, as they did in England, they’re not going to respond to strikes or civil wars by expanding education. And so that helps explain in the case of England, for example, why it lagged behind.\\n\\nAnd then there’s other conditions that also need to be in place. You need a minimum level, for instance, of fiscal capacity and administrative capacity to be able to roll out these plans. In the context of Mexico, for example, throughout the 19th century, there were all kinds of civil wars. And those civil wars led to a lot of laws that tried to create an education system that was focused on instilling obedience. But that could never be implemented, because there were no resources to do it.\\n\\nSimilarly, in the case of France after the French Revolution, during the Reign of Terror, there is an effort to pass laws to use education for indoctrination, but the state’s treasury is completely decimated, so they can’t implement that. So there are some conditions that need to be in place.\\n\\nThe other thing that also needs to be in place is that you need elites to come to the conclusion that the existing tools failed to contain the disorder, that a new type of approach is needed. So if you have a situation where you have a mass upheaval, but repression succeeds in quashing those rebels relatively quickly, then I would not expect that to be a situation where you turn to invest in education, because the existing tools worked. So it’s really in those contexts, where the masses are perceived as predisposed to violence and also elites believe that the existing tools are insufficient to address that violent predisposition—that’s when you turn to education.\\n\\nDemsas: I’m very persuaded by your argument. But I think there’s another theory I want to run past you.\\n\\nI’m a Protestant, and so I’m forced to ask, like, in my bones: What about Protestantism? There’s a great paper by Sascha Becker and Ludger Woessmann in QJE. They use county-level data from late-19th-century Prussia to figure out whether Protestantism led to better education and higher economic prosperity.\\n\\nThey essentially look at how close a given county was to Wittenberg. Wittenberg is where that story of Martin Luther nailing his 95 theses on the door of Castle Church happened. Apparently, whether these were nailed or pasted or even posted on the church doors is up for debate by historians, but I choose to imagine him nailing the theses to the door for dramatic Protestant effect.\\n\\nThe economists find a strong effect of distance from Wittenberg on literacy, which they say largely explains the Protestant lead in economic outcomes. Luther himself also called for boys’ and girls’ schools so they could read the Bible, have that kind of personal relationship with God that defines Protestantism against Catholicism.\\n\\nSo I can imagine a story that Protestantism, the development of Martin Luther’s ideas, and the push to develop these schools as a tool of religious education—that this sort of literacy leads to the development of schooling. And then you see the diffusion from Prussia to other countries, because, as you mentioned earlier in our episode, people were going to Prussia and going, like, Why are you so much more prosperous than us, better than us? And they are seeking to just copy things that feel distinctive. What’s wrong with that theory?\\n\\nPaglayan: I know the paper by Sascha Becker and Ludger Woessmann that you’re mentioning. I know it very well. I teach it in one of my courses on historical political economy, and I think they are definitely on to something.\\n\\nIt is the case, as you are articulating, that in Prussia, the Protestant elites played an important role, as well, in pushing for mass education. Now, what you have in Prussia is a situation where Protestants had been pushing for mass education for their own religious goals. And then what you then have is, in the 1740s and 1750s, a situation in which you have peasant revolts in the countryside.\\n\\nAnd at that point, the king says, Well, we need to do something to contain these peasant revolts and prevent them from recurring in the future. And the king’s advisers tell him, Well, we should use mass education to teach obedience to the state and its laws. And the king turns to Protestants, who have been providing mass education, to get their support on how to repurpose this Protestant education into an education that’s going to help the king’s goal of consolidating his political authority.\\n\\nAnd the Protestants, in this process, they give up some of their power to shape education. And in exchange for giving up that power, they get more resources. So for example, they get resources to fund a normal school, which is in charge of training teachers in Berlin. And the state says, Well, we’re going to give you a monopoly right over the training of these teachers, but the schools are going to be supervised by a state authority and no longer by the priests themselves. And the curriculum of the schools and the normal schools, as well, is going to be set by the state itself, not by the church.\\n\\nSo there’s ways in which the Protestant church gives up power in order to get more resources to do some of its projects and reach more people than it had in the past. Now, of course, that’s the story in Prussia. There’s other countries where you also have a legacy of Protestantism, and Protestantism doesn’t really do much there to expand primary education. But in the context of Prussia, I think you are absolutely right that it played a role, but it’s just not sufficient to explain why, then, the state took over this function.\\n\\nDemsas: This show is about questioning popular narratives, and I think that the idea that mass primary education was expanded by the west as a tool of social control—I think that’s a pretty controversial claim to a lot of people. But I’ll often gut-check my sense of what a popular narrative is with various sources. I’ll look at polling, or I’ll ask various experts in the field or, you know, read books and papers.\\n\\nOne thing I did when preparing for this interview was to just ask my fiancé, who’s not in education at all—he’s a software engineer—why he thought the spread of mass education happened first in the west. And I’m not joking—he immediately walked over to our bookshelf and pulled out a copy of Foucault’s book Discipline and Punish.\\n\\nYou mentioned this in your book, but some sociologists, like Foucault, have argued that schools are a tool of social control. The argument goes, you know, many modern institutions—like schools but also, hospitals, factories, and the military—they use confinement, and they normalize meticulous examinations of the body and routines in order to subjugate citizens to the state. Do you view your argument as essentially in line with that school of sociological thought?\\n\\nPaglayan: I do. I think that one of the contributions of the book is to reinstate that way of thinking about education. So Foucault wrote a lot, as you pointed out, on different ways of disciplining individuals, one of which, according to him, was schools. But Foucault also lost a lot of traction in sociology. There were sociologists who criticized him as providing a very cynical interpretation of history. There were also sociologists who said there was essentially no evidence, systematic evidence, whatsoever for his arguments.\\n\\nAnd so I think one of the contributions of the book is to provide a wealth of evidence that Foucault’s work didn’t have, that’s cross-national, that’s across two centuries, showing that indeed social-control goals were at the heart of governments’ efforts to regulate and expand primary education.\\n\\nAnd I think the other place where I think I depart from Foucault is in putting an emphasis, in the case of my work, in the role that the state played in creating schools for this disciplining purpose. He talks a lot about how schools discipline students, monitor their behavior, create norms of what constitutes good behavior and what constitutes deviant behavior. There’s a lot of that in Foucault, but what he doesn’t really talk much about is how this function of the school was something that the state itself created and used for its own sake of consolidating political authority.\\n\\nDemsas: I want to bring us to modern day, because I think a lot of people may find it easier to buy that this expansion of mass education happened in the 1700s, 1800s, even early 1900s as a tool of social control but may find it harder to stomach that that’s what’s happening now.\\n\\nSo much of expanding education is seen as a liberal, even progressive value. It’s seen as a way of empowering people, and even if it was the case that it was the intention hundreds of years ago, at this point, obviously, schools are a democratizing force. They’re a liberalizing force. They’re an empowering force.\\n\\nSo you cite research that talks to, you know, people in developing countries about why they want to expand education and find something that surprised me a lot. So could you tell us about that?\\n\\nPaglayan: Yes. So these days, it is absolutely true that if you ask a politician why they want to provide education, they’re going to tell you, Well, to promote economic development, to reduce poverty and inequality. In public, that’s what they’re going to say, because to say, We want to provide education to create docile and obedient citizens, would be political suicide, right? So usually that’s not what they’re gonna say.\\n\\nSo what this group of researchers at the Center for Global Development did was to try to get policy makers—they surveyed 900 policy makers across developing countries—to try to get them to reveal their true motive for providing education, without these policy makers knowing that’s what they were revealing.\\n\\nAnd so what they used was these forced-choice experiments, where they essentially gave policy makers the option to choose between two different sets of education systems. And what they had was, for example, in Scenario A, an education system that promotes 90 percent docile citizens or dutiful citizens, 10 percent skilled workforce, and 30 percent literate individuals—I don’t remember the specific details, but that’s one scenario. And then another scenario is, instead of 90 percent dutiful citizens, it’s 30 percent dutiful citizens, 90 percent literate workforce.\\n\\nAnd essentially, what you’re doing is for people to see, Okay, what do you prefer? Do you prefer 90 percent dutiful citizens or 90 percent skilled workforce? Do you prefer 90 percent dutiful citizens, or do you prefer 90 percent literate population? without them realizing that’s what they’re doing. And what they saw, by having many different pairs of comparisons and having these policy makers choose between these pairs, was that, by far, forming dutiful citizens was the goal that they prioritized over these other options.\\n\\nDemsas: I hear you talking about this, and you can’t help but think about the current education-reform movements in the United States. I think that they’re pretty cross-pressured, though, because I tried to think about how I would apply your theories to this kind of modern instantiation of it, and you see cross-pressures within the movement.\\n\\nOn the one hand, Republicans in many states have successfully pushed for decentralization efforts, like allowing the use of public dollars to send your kids to private, religious institutions, homeschooling, places where it’s actually quite difficult to, like, instill control about how people are teaching their children or what they’re learning. But then you also see this desire to eradicate certain books or reaffirm certain ideas about American history, about how racism functioned, about what it means about American identity really in reaction to, you know, the 1619 Project. You see that both in primary [education] but also throughout education, including higher education, like in Florida. How do you think about this? Do you still see this kind of education as a tool of social control?\\n\\nBecause, basically, there are two ways I can read this. One is that there’s a wing of the Republican Party that sees education as a tool of social control that they can continue to use to reaffirm certain ideas about America and what ideas people should believe, whether it’s about gender or race or other things. And on the other hand, there’s a wing in the Republican Party that believes that education is clearly a liberalizing force, and so, We need to decentralize and undermine this sort of public institution.\\n\\nPaglayan: That’s a very good point. So let me take a few steps back.\\n\\nSo the first thing I’ll say is that when I think of all of the efforts that the Republican Party has made since September 2020 with the creation of the patriotic education commission, or 1776 Commission, at that time, and then all of the subsequent state laws in Republican-controlled states to prohibit the teaching of so-called divisive concepts, such as the idea that there’s institutionalized racism, and all of the book bans that you were just describing—all of these I see as just another example of this pattern that the book identifies, which is a cross-national and a centuries-old pattern of politicians responding to mass protest against the status quo by turning to education to teach children that the status quo is actually okay. To the extent that Republicans are using public education, they want to ensure that public education is repurposed for the sake of teaching kids that the status quo is okay.\\n\\nAnd they’re doing this precisely after the Black Lives Matter protests, because that was a set of protests that were nationwide. And that sort of ignited a fear of what the country would look like if we were to reform the institutions that these elites benefit from. Now, I think you’re also right that there are some, and a not small portion within the Republican Party, who say, Well, better yet, let’s get rid of public education, and let’s try to have more education in the hands of parents and religious institutions providing education.\\n\\nBut I think there’s also a realistic sense that you can’t just get rid of public schools. So they’re doing both things at the same time to try to, in some ways, shift enrollment away from public schools but, also, reform public schools so that they serve this specific agenda. The one thing I’ll say, though, Jerusalem, is that we talk right now about how they want to use education to instill a specific set of political and moral values, and that the Republican Party wants to do this.\\n\\nBut in my view, the issue is: Liberals are also doing this. I haven’t really seen much effort on the part of liberals in rethinking education systems and saying, Hey. Yeah, we’re still teaching the Pledge of Allegiance in many states to 5-year-olds. They’re repeating, I swear allegiance to the U.S. flag and to the republic for which it stands. And these are 5-year-olds who don’t know how to write their name yet, much less know what the republic is that they’re swearing allegiance to. What does that even mean?\\n\\nSo there is a lot of continued, persistent use of education to teach a lot of norms, to teach the norm, for instance, that in the U.S., if you want to express discontent, you do it by voting. You don’t do it by protesting. And if you want to protest, it has to be a peaceful protest. That’s a norm. The idea that republican institutions are the best form of government—again, that’s an idea, but it’s not taught in a way that encourages critical thinking.\\n\\nAnd I hear a lot of liberals right now saying, Yes, and we shouldn’t teach critical thinking. We should indoctrinate for democracy. And so they’re kind of complicit in some ways. They want to teach a different set of ideas than conservatives, but they still want the education system to serve their own political agenda and teach a specific set of norms, instead of thinking, How can we use education to actually encourage critical thinking? And so that’s something that I also wanted to bring up as part of this conversation.\\n\\nDemsas: Yeah, I guess we’re coming a little bit full circle from this episode here, where, because maybe I had a unique experience of school or a less-common experience of school—I don’t know—I feel like I learned critical thinking in school. I feel like I was able to get pushback or things like that, but I think there’s a lot of people who have been doing a lot of writing in the tradition of Foucault and others about how that is not the common experience at educational institutions.\\n\\nPaglayan: Yes. Exactly. And the reality is that the lower the level of income of the student, the more the school tends to be focused on disciplining than on promoting critical thinking. So that’s the other thing, because I talked to some friends or colleagues who tell me, Yeah, but the school that my kid goes to—yeah, the school your kid goes to serves affluent people. And that’s not the group of people that politicians are concerned about disciplining: It’s the people who are at the bottom who need to be taught to stay in their place, to be happy with what they have, and so on. So that’s also relevant here.\\n\\nDemsas: Well, I think that’s a great place to ask our final question, which is: What is something that you once thought was a good idea but ended up being only good on paper?\\n\\nPaglayan: So I’ll say that, historically, I’ve been someone who was very focused on my intellectual development and thinking that my brain and my mind are crucial for my well-being. And investing in that is crucial for my well-being. And over the course of time, I’ve come to see that my body is also really important and that, oftentimes, it’s really taking care of acknowledging how I feel in my body that’s more important to figuring out what I really think for my well-being.\\n\\nAnd so that’s been sort of a bit of an evolution in trying to not to separate the body from the mind experience, and certainly trying not to prize the mind over the body, which is what I used to do.\\n\\nDemsas: I have had a very similar experience. Maybe it’s just, like, you’re getting older or whatever, but you have to get eight hours of sleep. And if you’re thinking about yourself in terms of, like, Well, I could have just continued reading. I could have continued doing more work. I could do more prep for this interview, or I could have written more.\\n\\nI also just think the research is getting pretty definitive here about things like stress and not taking care of yourself in that way having serious impacts down the line, in a way that’s really kind of conflicting with advice you get as a kid, which is just, like, Put everything you can. Sleep four hours a night. Neglect all these things about self-care in order to advance your intellectual pursuits. So I feel very similar.\\n\\nPaglayan: Exactly.\\n\\nDemsas: Yeah. Well, thank you so much, Agustina. I really enjoyed having you on the show.\\n\\nPaglayan: Thank you very much, Jerusalem.

       "   'content': 'Federal workers are scared. They don’t know who to trust. As President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have hacked away at federal agencies over the past few weeks, I’ve spoken with more than a dozen workers who have outlined how the administration is pushing a new ideology and stoking paranoia within the government’s remaining ranks. My sources work, or until recently worked, across six different agencies, including the State, Commerce, and Defense Departments and USAID; most requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak or they feared being targeted. “People are terrified,” one worker told me, “not for losing their jobs but for losing democracy.”\\n\\nThe workers described a fundamental transformation in the character of the government: Many workers say they live in a constant state of fear, unable to trust their colleagues, unable to speak freely, reflexively engaging in self-censorship even on matters they view as crucial to national security. One team that works on issues related to climate change has gone so far as to seal itself off in a completely technology-sanitized room for in-person meetings—no phones, watches, computers, or other connected devices. (Representatives for the Commerce and Defense Departments, USAID, DOGE, and the White House did not respond to my requests for comment.)\\n\\nRead: There’s a term for what Trump and Musk are doing\\n\\nThe widespread paralysis has been driven not just by the terminations and the crippling of entire agencies—which workers say has followed no apparent logic or process—but by executive orders and internal communications. Take the first diplomatic cable sent by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, on January 21, the day after the inauguration. The message, which was sent to all members of the State Department, and which outlined various priorities, takes an “Orwellian” tone, as one State Department employee described it to me. Next to a priority labeled “Stopping Censorship and Prioritizing Truth,” Rubio wrote that although the State Department has been “combatting malign propaganda from hostile states” since the Cold War, the agency has also recently worked to promote “censorship, suppression, and misinformation” targeting Americans—perhaps motivated by “an excess of zeal or misguided attempts to control discourse.” The email, a copy of which I obtained, goes on:\\n\\nThis Department will forever stand in support and defense of Americans’ natural and First Amendment rights to free speech. We will combat genuine enemy propaganda, but always and only with the truth: that America is a great and good and just country, whose people are generous, and whose leaders now prioritize our core interests while respecting the rights and interests of other nations. Above all, programs that lead or in any way open the door to the censorship of the American people will be terminated.\\n\\nMy sources were disturbed by the idea that the administration would dictate “the truth” and accuse workers of censoring Americans. (What censorship Rubio is referring to is unclear, and a State Department spokesperson, who replied to my email inquiry without giving their name, said only, “As a general matter, we do not comment on internal personnel matters.”) Those working on behalf of Trump have already hidden information and engaged in censorship themselves, deleting scientific data and prompting researchers to scrub terms related to gender and sexuality from their work, in addition to purging information related to climate change and more. Because of this, one worker said, colleagues at his agency have considered replacing the generic word including with such as in reports, given the word’s proximity to inclusion, or excising terms like vulnerable groups, which are often used to refer to children, out of concern that they could be flagged under the administration’s sweeps to eradicate anything pertaining to diversity.\\n\\nTransitions of power always lead to changes in priorities, but that is not what the workers say they are witnessing. Instead, the new Trump administration is engineering what some feel could be described only as ideological obedience.\\n\\nSecretary Rubio’s message is just one example of the many ways the Trump administration has made these red lines apparent. Many Republicans have spoken out against any group or agency that could be perceived as censoring conservative voices. Shortly after the election, for instance, the State Department’s Global Engagement Center, an operation for countering foreign disinformation and propaganda established by President Barack Obama, shut down after a Republican-controlled House didn’t re-up its funding. Federal workers I spoke with now say that neither they nor their colleagues want to be associated in any way with working on or promoting disinformation research—even as they are aware that the U.S. government’s lack of visibility into such networks could create a serious national vulnerability, especially as AI gives state-backed operations powerful upgrades. Some are even discussing whether they should revise existing technical documents to scrub references to “misinformation” and “disinformation.” As one source told me, “If this administration is dictating the truth and dismantling disinformation efforts, you can’t bring it up anymore. You just don’t want to put a target on your back. Whether it’s intended or not, self-censorship emerges.”\\n\\nFederal workers told me that this self-censorship started with issues related to DEI. On the third day of the Trump administration, the Office of Personnel Management instructed agency heads to email their employees a notice asking them to report one another for violations of President Trump’s executive order. Both the fear of being reported by colleagues and the fear of being punished for not reporting colleagues quickly led to a pervasive loss of trust and communication, my sources told me. Many employees stopped speaking openly in meetings in front of unfamiliar co-workers. Pronouns were dropped from emails; pride flags were taken off desks; references to Black History Month and promoting women in STEM were excised from office discussions, they said. Several workers told me they believed this was the intention: “Make people question what is safe—Where can I speak? Who can I speak to? How can I speak? You create a culture of chaos, fear, and confusion,” Stephie-Anne Duliepre, a former Science for Development fellow at USAID, told me. “I think that was the strategy because it was effective: wearing people out, stripping people’s will or faith that if they ever speak up they would be safe.”\\n\\nThis feeling may be by design. Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget and architect of Project 2025, said in private speeches obtained by ProPublica that “we want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected. When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.”\\n\\nSome federal workers who collect health and medical data from Americans to support a wide array of downstream research, including cancer-drug discovery, are discussing whether to continue recording if patients are transgender, or information about pregnancies and abortions, an employee told me. The absence of that information will limit the kind of research that scientists can do, like studying how a drug affects pregnant women, or gender-based health disparities. But the workers are wrestling with whether having these data will put Americans in danger of being targeted by their own government, the employee said. Although workers have often asked patients about illegal behavior in the past, including illicit drug use, this time feels different: “It’s not just because it’s illegal in some places,” the employee said, referring to abortions. “It’s because it’s political.”\\n\\nRead: DOGE has God-mode access to government data\\n\\nClimate change has become another perceived taboo, sources told me. At the Department of Defense, the direction has been explicit. On January 27, several staffers received an email from superiors, according to a copy I reviewed, stating that the director of Army staff was working to suspend any activities “associated with, but not limited to the following areas: Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, Critical Race Theory, Climate and climate change, Transgender, and Abortion policies.\" In other cases, workers are drawing their own conclusions. Some are discussing how to reframe climate-related policy documents, or even research on issues that could have downstream climate implications, into other kinds of energy and environmental issues that are more in line with the Trump administration’s priorities. (Trump signed an executive order directing agencies to pay “particular attention to oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical mineral, and nuclear energy resources,” for example.)\\n\\nFor any communications related to climate and other sensitive topics, the team that has stopped bringing internet-connecting devices to in-person meetings has also shifted from email to Signal messages, a worker in the group told me. “All I have ever wanted to do was help the American people become more resilient to climate change,” the worker told me. “Now I am being treated like a criminal.”\\n\\nDuring my conversations, many workers referred to George Orwell’s 1984, and its portrayal of a totalitarian regime through the eyes of a minor government bureaucrat, to explain the scope and scale of their experience. They referenced the Ministry of Truth, doublethink, and Newspeak as they described what was happening. Six terminated workers at USAID conveyed to me how the agency’s rapid dismantlement represented an example of the worst of what could happen in this environment: DOGE swept in, Trump froze virtually all aid spending, and Musk began blasting USAID publicly as a “criminal organization.” Agency staff were slow to grasp the full scope of what was happening and to react—they told me that they wish they’d organized protests or sounded the alarm to the outside world more quickly. Under the new regime, the staff became more afraid to talk to one another in large groups and stopped connecting their personal devices to the government Wi-Fi for fear of being surveilled. “USAID is a canary in a coal mine,” a terminated USAID worker told me. “It felt like being hunted by your own government.”'},\n",

In a tradition dating back to colonial days, leases all over the city expired precisely at that time. Thousands of tenants would load their belongings on carts and move, stepping around other people’s piles of clothing and furniture. Paintings of that day look like a mass eviction, or the aftermath of some kind of disaster. In fact, that day represented a novel American form of hope. Mobility, or the right to decide where you wanted to live, was a great American innovation. But lately, that mobility is stalling, with real consequences for politics, culture, and the national mood.\\n\\nIn this episode of Radio Atlantic, we talk with Yoni Appelbaum, a senior editor and the author of the new book Stuck: How the Privileged and the Propertied Broke the Engine of American Opportunity. Appelbaum explains how, over the decades, several forces combined to make it harder for the average American to move and improve their circumstances. And he lands at some surprising culprits: progressives, such as Jane Jacobs, who wanted to save cities but instead wound up blocking natural urban evolution and shutting newcomers out.\\n\\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\\n\\nHanna Rosin: This is Radio Atlantic. I’m Hanna Rosin.\\n\\nI have moved many times in my life: across continents, across the country, back and forth across D.C., which is where I live now. And I didn’t think much about it. I just chalked it up to restlessness—until I read Yoni Appelbaum’s new book, which is also the March cover story in The Atlantic. The book is called Stuck: How the Privileged and the Propertied Broke the Engine of American Opportunity.\\n\\nAppelbaum argues that there is and always has been something quintessentially American—and also, quintessentially hopeful—about moving. In the 19th century, Moving Day was, like, a thing—a holiday celebrated across different American cities at different times, when everybody would just up and move. To quote Appelbaum: “Nothing quite so astonished visitors from abroad as the spectacle of thousands upon thousands of people picking up and swapping homes in a single day.”\\n\\nBut moving isn’t happening so much anymore. As Appelbaum writes: “Every year, fewer Americans can afford to live where they want to.” So what happens to a country—geographically, culturally, politically, and, in some ways, psychologically—when mobility starts to stall?\\n\\n[Music]\\n\\nRosin: Can you read this from your intro, these couple of sentences?\\n\\nYoni Appelbaum: “The notion that people should be able to choose their own communities—instead of being stuck where they happen to be born—is America’s most profound contribution to the world … The fact that it is now endangered is not just a problem for housing markets; it’s a lethal threat to the entire American project.”\\n\\nRosin: Okay. Let’s start with the second half: Why is mobility the thing that defines the American project?\\n\\nAppelbaum: It is the thing that defines the American project, because it was the first thing that anyone who got here from Europe noticed. People would come to the United States and gawk. They saw this as either our greatest asset or our great national character flaw. But they were amazed at how often Americans moved. And they were particularly amazed that the Americans who were moving were not moving out of desperation, that Americans tended to be doing okay in one place and to still want something more for themselves—want something better for their children—and to move someplace else in pursuit of it.\\n\\nRosin: And you’re not just describing something geographic. You’re describing something psychological.\\n\\nAppelbaum: Yeah. I’m talking about an attitude that Americans believed that they could change their destinies by changing their address, that they could move someplace new and do better than they were doing. And also—and this is the second half of the answer—Americans believed that they were not defined by the circumstances of their birth. That was the great gift that mobility gave us. And that had really profound implications that took me a while to unravel.\\n\\nRosin: Right. Because it’s not just about geography. It’s not just about money.\\n\\nIt’s about a sense of yourself as having infinite possibilities. Like, you could just move and move. You weren’t class-bound in any way.\\n\\nAppelbaum: Here’s the thing about American individualism: We are individuals, in the sense that we have the ability to construct our own identities, but we define ourselves by virtue of the communities that we choose to join.\\n\\nThroughout the world, communities tended to choose their members. Even in the early United States, in the colonial era, if you tried to move in someplace, you could be warned out. The town had the right to say, Hey. You may have bought property here. You may have leased a building. You may have a job. We don’t want you here. And not surprisingly, they disproportionately warned out the poor. They warned out minorities. Really, American communities, for the first couple hundred years of European settlement, were members-only clubs.\\n\\nAnd then in the early 19th century, there’s a legal revolution. And instead of allowing communities to choose their members, we allow people to choose their communities. You could move someplace and say, I intend to live here, and that was enough to become a legal resident of that place.\\n\\nRosin: So just in numbers, can you give a sense of where we are now? What’s the statistic that shows most starkly the decline in mobility now?\\n\\nAppelbaum: In the 19th century, as best I can calculate it, probably one out of three Americans moved every year.\\n\\nRosin: Every year?\\n\\nAppelbaum: Every year. In some cities, it might be half. In the 20th century, as late as 1970, it was one out of five. And the census in December told us we just set a new record, an all-time low. It’s dropped over the last 50 years to one out of 13. It is the most profound social change to overcome America in the last half century.\\n\\nRosin: It’s so interesting, because if you told me that someone moved that many times in a year, I would not associate that with upward mobility. I would associate that with desperation and problems.\\n\\nAppelbaum: For a long time, that’s exactly what historians thought too. There was this guy, Stephan Thernstrom, who set out to investigate this, and thought what he had discovered, in all this moving about, was what he called the “floating proletariat,” right? Here was evidence that, in America, the American dream was chimerical. You couldn’t actually attain it. There was this great mass of people just moving from one place to another to another.\\n\\nAnd several decades later, as we got better data-mining tools, we were able to follow up on the floating proletariat and find out what happened to them. The people who had stayed in one place, Thernstrom saw—they were doing a little better than they had before. But when we could track the people who had left, it turned out, they were doing much better, that the people who relocate—even the ones at the bottom of the class structure—across every decade that historians can study, it’s the case that the people who move do better economically. And this is really key: Their kids do better than the people who stayed where they were.\\n\\nRosin: It’s like Americans are, in their soul, psychological immigrants. Like, that we behave the way we think of immigrants behaving, and the more robustly we do that, the better off Americans are. The most evocative image that you draw is something called “Moving Day,” from an earlier era. I had never heard of that. Can you paint a picture of what that is?\\n\\nAppelbaum: We’ve got these wonderful accounts of Moving Day from people who came over, more or less, just to see it. By law or by custom, in most cities and in most rural areas, all unwritten leases expired on the same day of the year. And this actually gave renters an enormous leg up in the world in most times, in most places, because it meant that an enormous number of properties were potentially available to them. They could go back to their landlord and say, If you want me to stay for another year, you gotta fix the leaky sink. Or they could try someplace better.\\n\\nAnd they would all pile their possessions down at the curb. First thing in the morning, they’d hire a cart to take them across town or down the lane, and then they would push past the family that was moving out of some other apartment or townhouse or home. As they were taking their stuff out, they’d be moving their stuff in. But between sunup and sundown, a quarter, a third, half of a city might relocate. And there are these descriptions of trash lining the gutters as things fell out of the carts or there wasn’t room for it in the new apartment, and people would go scavenging through the gutters, trying to find, out of the trash, their own treasures.\\n\\nIt was raucous and wild, and respectable Americans always looked down on it. And yet, for the people who participated in it, it was a way to have their home be kind of like an iPhone or a car: You keep the one you have for a year or two, and then you trade up for a newer model.\\n\\nRosin: So upgrades. Now, where is this happening? Is this happening in cities of a certain size, in immigrant communities? Like, who is doing all this chaotic moving?\\n\\nAppelbaum: Well, that’s one thing that really upset the upper crust.\\n\\nRosin: And who are they? Let’s define all the sides. Who are the respectable Americans?\\n\\nAppelbaum: The respectable Americans are those of long-standing stock who are trying very hard to impress the European cousins. And they are appalled that this defect of their national character—that people don’t know their place. They don’t know their station. They’re always moving around looking for something better for themselves, and they write about it in those kinds of moralistic terms.\\n\\nBut the people who are participating in it, it’s very broad. I mean, when you’re talking about half the city moving, what you’re talking about is activity that’s as much a middle-class and upper-middle-class activity as it is a working-class activity. As long as you are adding a good number of fresh new homes to the market every year, pretty much everybody who moved could move up, because the wealthy were buying brand-new homes that had just been erected.\\n\\nBut they were vacating, you know, homes that were a few years older or apartments that they were moving out of, and those became available to the upper-middle class, right? And you’d get a chain of moves. You can trace this, you know, a dozen, 15 moves, one family succeeding another, succeeding another—and everybody moving up to something a little bit better than they had the year before. And, you know, just like an iPhone or a car, they’re chasing technological innovation. One year, you move into a new apartment, and it’s got running water. And, you know, two years later, the water runs hot and cold, and it’s a miracle, right? So everybody is constantly moving up in the world as they constantly relocate.\\n\\nRosin: So there are decades of massive amounts of mobility. It’s considered respectable enough. And then, at some moment, a few forces start to slow this all down. So can you tell the story of what happens in Lower Manhattan?\\n\\nAppelbaum: Yeah. It’s sort of a sad story when you look closely at it. Lower Manhattan, the Lower East Side, is like no place that’s ever existed before or since. It is so dense. People are living in tenements at a sort of rate per acre, the way demographers measure this, that is multiples of any place in Manhattan today.\\n\\nRosin: Do you remember the numbers? Because I think they’re extraordinary. Maybe I’m just remembering this from going to the Tenement Museum, but when you actually look at the density numbers, they are just hard to get your head around.\\n\\nAppelbaum: Yeah. I think it’s, like, 600 per acre. It’s really, really, really high. There’s no place in Manhattan today that’s even a third as dense, even though the buildings are now much, much taller. So they’re really squeezed in there. And reformers are appalled. And there are real problems with some of these, you know—what they’re really appalled about, it turns out, is less the housing conditions than the presence of so many immigrants, with their foreign ways, foreign religion, foreign languages, weird foods, odd smells, right?\\n\\nThey’re looking at this, and they are not happy that this is invading their city. They’re not subtle about it. They’re quite clear that they think that apartments are themselves degrading. This is the original progressive era, and there’s a tight intertwining between the reformers and government, and they move fluidly among them.\\n\\nRosin: Wait. Like, who is the “they”? Are we talking about city planners? Just, this is a really interesting moment. So I just want to—because it’s unexpected, this part of the history.\\n\\nAppelbaum: Lawrence Veiller is sort of Mr. Tenement Reform. He’s the guy who will write most of the reports, who’ll serve on the commissions, who’ll move in as the first deputy commissioner of the Tenement Office when New York creates one. Like, he is both a government official and a reformer, and that was pretty typical. They move fluidly among these jobs. And he is the guy who really goes on a crusade against tenements.\\n\\nAnd maybe the most remarkable moment in my research was stumbling across a speech he gave at a conference, where somebody had asked, How do you keep apartments out of your city? And he says, Well, you know. The problem is: If you put it to a vote, you can’t keep them out of your city, because people actually like living in apartments. They serve a useful function. So what you have to do is solve it the way I’ve done it in New York: You call it fire-safety regulation. And you put a bunch of regulations on the apartments that make them prohibitively expensive to build. But be careful not to put any fire-safety regulations on single- or two-family homes, because that would make them too expensive. And as long as you call it “fire safety,” you can get away with keeping the apartments and their residents out of your neighborhoods.\\n\\nAnd it’s one of those moments where, you know, you just sort of gape at the page, and you think, I can’t believe he actually said it. I was worried, maybe, I was reading too much into some of the other things that he’d said. But here he is straightforwardly saying that much of the regulatory project that he and other progressives pursued was purely pretextual. They were trying to find a whole set of rules that could make it too expensive for immigrants to move into their neighborhoods.\\n\\nRosin: So we’re in a moment of just resistance to tenements and apartments and crowdedness. How does this, then, become encoded? What’s the next step they take?\\n\\nAppelbaum: You know, the problem with building codes is that, ultimately, there are ways around them. People are developing new technologies. It’s not enough to keep the apartments back. It’s not enough to pen the immigrants into the Lower East Side.\\n\\nAnd there’s a bigger problem, which is that the garment industry in New York is moving up Fifth Avenue. And on their lunch breaks, the Jewish garment workers are getting some fresh air on the sidewalks, and this infuriates the owners of the wealthy department stores on Fifth Avenue, who say, You’re scaring off our wealthy customers. And they want to push them out. They try rounding them up and carting them off in police wagons. They try negotiating with the garment-factory owners. But, of course, these workers want to be out on the sidewalk. It’s their one chance for fresh air, and it’s a public sidewalk. So there’s a limit to what they can do, and they finally hit on a new solution, which is: If you change the law so that you can’t build tall buildings near these department stores, then you can push the garment factories back down toward the Lower East Side.\\n\\nRosin: You know, anytime you step into the history of the technical and possibly boring word zoning, you hit racism.\\n\\nAppelbaum: You know, the thing about zoning, which is sort of the original sin of zoning—which is a tool invented on the West Coast to push the Chinese out of towns and then applied—\\n\\nRosin: —in progressive Berkeley! That’s another thing I learned in your book, is how Berkeley, essentially, has such racist zoning origins.\\n\\nAppelbaum: It’s a really painful story, and zoning, ultimately, is about saying there are always laws, which said there are things that you can’t do in crowded residential areas. But zoning was a set of tools, which said, Some things are going to be okay on one side of the tracks and not okay on the other. And given that that was the approach from the beginning, it was always about separating populations into different spaces.\\n\\nAnd so New York adopts the first citywide zoning code. And at first, this is spreading from city to city. The New Deal will take it national.\\n\\nRosin: And what does—the zoning code is not explicitly racist? What does it actually say in the government documents?\\n\\nAppelbaum: Well, that’s the brilliance of the zoning code. The courts have been striking down explicit racial segregation. But if you wrote your ordinance carefully enough and never mentioned race, you could segregate land by its use. You could figure out how to allow in some parts of your city only really expensive housing, or in other parts of your city, you could put all of the jobs that a particular immigrant group tended to have.\\n\\nRosin: Like the Chinese laundromat on the West Coast. Like, No laundromats. That’s the famous one.\\n\\nAppelbaum: Exactly. That’s the original zoning ordinance: We’re gonna push all the laundries back into Chinatown. And if you push the laundries into Chinatown, you’re pushing their workers into Chinatown. So there were ways to effectively segregate—not foolproof, but effectively segregate—your population without ever having to use any racial language in the ordinance, and so it could stand up in court but still segregate your population.\\n\\nRosin: Okay, so we have zoning laws, we have government complicity in kind of dividing where people live, and then we have someone who comes in as a supposed savior, particularly of Lower Manhattan. Maybe not a savior, but someone who appreciates the diversity in the city as it is, and that’s Jane Jacobs. And you tell a very different story of the role she plays in all of this, which really brings us to the modern era. So can you talk about who she is and what role she played in transforming Lower Manhattan?\\n\\nAppelbaum: Yeah, it’s a little heartbreaking sometimes to look closely at your heroes and find out that the story you thought you knew is not the one that actually played out. Jane Jacobs was a woman who saw clearly what it was that made cities great, at a time when almost nobody wanted to recognize that.\\n\\nShe saw the diversity of their populations, of their uses, the way that people mixed together as being not, as the progressives had it, something that needed to be corrected with rational planning, but as a strength that needed to be recognized and rescued and reinforced. And she stood tall against urban renewal, against the notion that the way to save cities was to knock them flat and to rebuild them with all the uses very carefully segregated out.\\n\\nAnd she wrote this brilliant book, The Death and Life of Great American Cities, that laid out these principles, and she saved her own neighborhood from urban renewal and became, in the process, sort of the patron saint of urbanism. And her great lesson that she took from all of these experiences was that you needed to empower individuals with a deep appreciation of urban life, with the tools to stop governments. And that was the gospel that she preached. And in many ways, it was necessary at that moment, at the peak of urban renewal. But what she didn’t understand at the time—maybe couldn’t have understood at the time—was that she was going to create problems that were even worse than the problems that she was trying to prevent.\\n\\n[Music]\\n\\nRosin: After the break: how Jane Jacobs inadvertently contributed to the stuckness of America.\\n\\n[Break]\\n\\nRosin: Okay, so here we have Jane Jacobs. She moves into—what street was that that she moved into?\\n\\nAppelbaum: She moves into 555 Hudson Street.\\n\\nRosin: Okay, she’s on Hudson Street. That’s an amazing place to live. What had been all around her was—who was living there at the time? It wasn’t other people like her.\\n\\nAppelbaum: No, it mostly wasn’t. She and her husband are two working professionals in Manhattan who are able to pay all cash for a townhouse on this block that is mostly filled with immigrant families. And it’s changing at the time. She’s not alone in coming in, in that way.\\n\\nBut it’s mostly been a neighborhood of immigrants, the children of immigrants. It’s got tons of street-front retail, and she writes about this beautifully, which activates the street front. The eyes on the street keep them safe during the day. She writes about the intricate ballet of the sidewalk as people dodge around each other, and people each pursuing their own tasks are able to live in harmony, in concert. She writes about this block absolutely beautifully, even as she is killing all of it.\\n\\nRosin: So if we freeze her there, then she’s a heroine of the city who appreciates it in all its diversity. So then what happens? How does the tragedy begin?\\n\\nAppelbaum: You know, I tracked down the family that was in that building before she bought it. It was a man named Rudolph Hechler. Two of his adult children and his wife were working in a candy store on the ground floor. So they were renting, living above the shop that they operated, and that shop was everything that Jacobs says make cities great. It was a place where you could go and drop your keys if you’re going to be out for a while, and your kid could come pick them up and let themselves into the house. It was a place where you could just stop and talk to your neighbors.\\n\\nIt was the kind of thing that Jacobs praised, but when she buys the building, she gut renovates it. She tears out the storefront. She turns it into a single-family home. She rips off the facade of this historic building and replaces it with modern metal-sash windows. She so thoroughly alters the appearance, presents a blank front to the street, where before there’d been a lively storefront, that when they eventually, at her urging, historically landmark the block, they find that the building that she lives in has no historic value whatsoever.\\n\\nAnd so here, you have somebody who has written this ode to the way people are living around her but buys a building within it and changes it to suit her own family’s need—which was a reasonable thing, I should say, for her to do under the circumstances—but then landmarks the block, which prevents people from building new buildings in the way that that block had always had. So there’s a couple buildings right next to hers that have been torn down and turned into a six-story apartment building before she moves in. But her changes make it so that nobody can do that again. And if you’re not building new buildings to accommodate growth, what you’re going to have in response to mounting demand is rising prices.\\n\\nRosin: So the counterfactual history with no Jane Jacobs—I understand that this is imaginary—is what? You just build bigger, taller apartment buildings that more people can afford to move into, and you maintain it as a mixed neighborhood, which is partly immigrant, partly young professors?\\n\\nAppelbaum: Yeah, the counterfactual is that her neighborhood and other urban neighborhoods throughout the country continue to do what they had done right up until about 1970, which is that they evolve. Sometimes the buildings get taller; sometimes they get shorter. I lived in a neighborhood once that had seen lots of buildings have their top stories shorn off when demand had fallen.\\n\\nCities morphed; they changed. And yes, in response to mounting demand, you would have had to build up. You have to make space for people to live in cities if you want to continue to attract new generations and give them the kinds of opportunities that previous generations have had. But she did not want that. And in fact, almost nobody ever wants that, which is a real challenge.\\n\\nRosin: And is this aesthetic? Is it just that it’s historic preservation? Is it just about: People arrive at a place, and they have an aesthetic preference, and that’s what ends up freezing change? Like, that’s what ends up preventing change?\\n\\nAppelbaum: Well, let’s go back to the beginning of the 19th century, when we get this legal change, which says, You can just move someplace and establish residence. The reason that states make that change is because they are looking around at communities, and they see that communities individually are walling themselves off to new arrivals, even though, collectively, it is in the interest of the individual states and the United States to let people move around.\\n\\nThey take that right away from communities. They recognize that if you let communities govern themselves, they will always wall themselves off. Change is really hard. It is uncomfortable. Even if a lot of changes leave you better off, while you’re going through them, you may not welcome them. And if you give communities the power to say, We’re going to pick and choose what we allow. We’re going to pick and choose who can live here, then those communities will almost always exercise that power in exclusionary ways.\\n\\nAnd this is even worse: The communities that exercise it most effectively will be the ones that are filled with people with the time and the money and the resources and the education to do that. And so you’ll separate out your population by race, by income. That’s what happens. That’s what was happening in the United States when we opened ourselves up to mobility. And we reversed that, and for a long stretch, we were this remarkable place where people could move where they wanted.\\n\\nAnd as we’ve switched that and given the tools back to local communities to make these decisions, the communities are behaving the way that local communities have always behaved, which is with a strong aversion to change and a disinclination to allow the interests of people who might move into the community to trump the interests of those who are already there.\\n\\nRosin: And I guess the communities who are less willing to see themselves that way, because it goes against their sense of themselves, or progressive communities—like people who are interested in historic preservation, who say they love cities, who are interested in urban renewal—like, those are not the same people who think of themselves as complicit. I mean, your subtitle is accusatory. It’s like, “breaking the engine of opportunity.”\\n\\nAppelbaum: It is, and it’s led to a lot of uncomfortable conversations with friends. But when I look out at the country, what I see clearly is that the people who believe that government can make a difference in the world, the people who believe that through laws and collective action, we can pursue public goods—they want government to do things like preserve history, protect the environment, help historically marginalized populations. Well, they create a set of tools to do this. They’re inclined to see government use those tools. When, invariably, those tools get twisted against their original purposes and get used, instead, to reward affluence, it is the most progressive jurisdictions where this happens to the greatest extent.\\n\\nI’ll give you a statistic from California that blew my mind, which is that for every 10 points the liberal vote share goes up in a California city, the number of new housing permits it issues drops by 30 percent.\\n\\nRosin: You talked about how this changes our framework on certain things, like a housing crisis—that we tend to say there’s a housing crisis, but that isn’t quite right.\\n\\nAppelbaum: Yeah. We talk a lot about an affordable-housing crisis, but what we’ve got is a mobility crisis. And the distinction is twofold: One, there’s a lot of cheap housing in America. It’s not in the places where most people want to live. Housing tends to get really, really cheap when all the jobs disappear. I would not recommend relocating large numbers of Americans to those communities. Their prospects will be pretty bleak. You want the housing to be where the opportunities are rich. And so if all we’re trying to do is make housing affordable, without an eye on where that housing is located, on what kinds of opportunities it opens up, we’re pursuing the wrong solutions.\\n\\nWe also often—and this is the other side of it—create solutions. If we think of it as an affordable-housing problem, you can do something like build a lot of new public housing. But we’ve never in this country managed to build enough public housing to meet demand. Usually, if you manage to get in, it’s like a winning lottery ticket. Why would you ever give that up? Which is to say that you are stuck in place. You are tied to the place where you happen to be lucky enough to get the rent-controlled apartment, to get the public-housing unit, to get your voucher accepted after months of fruitless searching. And then you’re really disinclined to leave, even if staying in that place puts you and your family at all kinds of disadvantages.\\n\\nAnd so if we have policy that’s focused on allowing people to live where they want, rather than policy that’s simply focused on affordability, we’re likely to return not just the kind of social and economic dynamism that have made America a wonderful place to live, but we’re also likely to return the sense of personal agency.\\n\\nRosin: Okay. Last thing: In reading this book and having this conversation, what struck me is that, essentially, you’re making a defense of America—its rootlessness, America’s infinite choice. And right now, those two things—our rootlessness and our infinite choice—are things which we think of as cursing us. The words we often use now are loneliness, lack of community, bowling alone—however you want to call it. We talk a lot about our spiritual collapse as related to the same mobility and rootlessness that you describe as a positive force in the book. And I wonder how you’ve talked about that or reconciled it.\\n\\nAppelbaum: If you take a graph of when Americans joined a lot of clubs—the Bowling Alone graph, right, where Americans belong to a lot of voluntary associations and when they didn’t—and you match it against the graph of when Americans have moved a lot and when they haven’t, they line up really well, and they line up in a surprising way.\\n\\nWhen we’re moving a lot, we’re much likelier to build really vibrant communities. When you leave someplace and start over, you’re gonna go to church on Sunday to try to find friends and build connections. Or if church is not for you, maybe you go to the local bar. Maybe you join the PTA. It depends on the phase of life that you’re in. But when people relocate, they tend to be much more proactive in seeking out social connection. Over the course of time, we fall into familiar ruts. We tend not to make as many new connections. We tend not to join as many new organizations. And people who have been a resident for a long time in a place—they may list a lot more things that they belong to, but they’re less likely to be attending them, and they’re less likely to add new ones.\\n\\nThe peak of American communal life comes during our peaks of mobility. When we’re moving around a lot, we’re creating a really vibrant civil society that was the envy of the world. And over the last 50 years, as we’ve moved less and less and less, all of those things have atrophied. And there’s one other side, too, which is: It’s not just about measuring the health of voluntary organizations. If you’re moving a lot, you’re giving yourself a chance to define who you want to be, to build the connections that are important and meaningful to you, as opposed to the ones that you’ve inherited.\\n\\nWe know something about how that works psychologically. People who are trapped in inherited identities tend to become more cynical, more embittered, more disconnected over time. People who have the chance to choose their identities tend to be more hopeful. They tend to see a growing pie that can be divided more ways, and therefore they’re more welcoming of strangers and new arrivals. They tend to be more optimistic. And if you restore that dynamism, it doesn’t mean that you’ve got to leave behind your inherited identities. It means that committing to those inherited identities becomes a matter of active choice too.\\n\\nAnd so the United States, traditionally, was a country that was much more religious than the rest of the world, because people could commit to those faiths that they were adopting or sticking with. Americans were expected to have a narrative of, like, Why do I go to church? It wasn’t something which was really comprehensible to somebody who came from a country where everybody had the same faith. You didn’t have to ask yourself, Why am I Muslim? Why am I Catholic? In America, you always did.\\n\\nAnd so our faith traditions tended to be particularly vibrant. So it’s not some sort of assault on tradition. I’m not advocating that we dissolve our social ties and each new generation negotiate new ones. I’m saying, the thing that has made American traditions very vibrant, the thing that often made American immigrants more patriotic than the people in the lands they left behind, and American churchgoers more religious than they had been in the old world was precisely the fact that they got to choose.\\n\\nAnd even committing to your old traditions and your inherited identities became a matter of active choice, and something that was much more important to folks. And so you got the vibrancy both ways—both the new affiliations that you could create, the old traditions that you chose to double down on. But it all stemmed from individual agency. You have to give people the chance to start over so that their decision to stay is equally meaningful. If you choose to stay, that’s great. If you feel like you’ve got no choice, that’s really terrible.\\n\\nRosin: All right. Well, thank you, Yoni, for laying that out and joining us today.\\n\\nAppelbaum: Oh, it’s a pleasure.\\n\\n[Music]\\n\\nRosin: Thanks again to Yoni Appelbaum.

Sign up for it here.\\n\\nThey arrived casually dressed and extremely confident—a self-styled super force of bureaucratic disrupters, mostly young men with engineering backgrounds on a mission from the president of the United States, under the command of the world’s wealthiest online troll.\\n\\nOn February 7, five Department of Government Efficiency representatives made it to the fourth floor of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau headquarters, where the executive suites are located. They were interrupted while trying the handles of locked office doors.\\n\\n“Hey, can I help you?” asked an employee of the agency that was soon to be forced into bureaucratic limbo. The DOGE crew offered no clear answer.\\n\\nNearby, a frazzled IT staffer was rushing past, attempting to find a way to carry out the bidding of the newcomers.\\n\\n“Are you okay?” an onlooker asked.\\n\\n“This is not normal,” the staffer replied.\\n\\nSimilar Trump-administration teams had moved into the U.S. Agency for International Development the previous weekend to, as DOGE leader Elon Musk later wrote on his social network, feed the $40 billion operation “into the woodchipper.” A memo barred employees from returning to the headquarters building but made no mention of the other USAID offices, allowing some civil servants one last look at their desk before the guidance was revised.\\n\\n“Books were open, and things had been riffled through,” one USAID staffer told us.\\n\\nA second USAID employee said she had the same experience, finding signs “of activity overnight.” Her brochures and folders had been moved around. Panera cookie wrappers were left on her desk and in the trash can nearby, she said.\\n\\n“It’s like the panopticon,” one USAID contractor told us, recalling a prison designed to let an unseen guard keep watch over its inhabitants. “There’s a sense that Elon Musk, through DOGE, is always watching. It has created a big sense of fear.”\\n\\nThe contractor said that she had placed her government laptop in her closet at home, underneath a pile of clothes, in case DOGE was using it to listen to her private conversations. She said that other colleagues were so paranoid, they had discussed stowing their laptop in their refrigerator.\\n\\nOver at the Department of Education, the new strike force invited sympathetic witnesses to cheer their arrival. Christopher Rufo, a conservative activist who had been appointed by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis as trustee of a Florida college, posted photos like a soldier on the front: the door of the building, a picture of the secretary of education’s office. “Such a cool vibe right now,” he wrote. “And everyone is waiting for the opening moves.”\\n\\nDonald Trump wanted to act fast upon his return to power. He was determined to fundamentally change the institutions that had so effectively constrained him during his first term. “I am your retribution,” he had promised on the campaign trail. This time he would be seemingly everywhere at once, the only public notice coming in unverified claims made by social-media accounts overseen by Musk and through leaks by the workforce that bore the brunt of the assault.\\n\\nUndefined and hard to track, DOGE has claimed to be a new government department but operates more as a disembodied specter. Some of its emissaries, including Musk, have insisted that they don’t work for DOGE at all, but for the White House directly as “special government employees.” Much of the cost savings that Musk has touted as DOGE victories on social media have been carried out by other appointees.\\n\\nOver the first month of Trump’s new term, patterns have nonetheless emerged as a small crew of Musk’s young technologists work their way through the federal workforce. This new unit has trained its initial attention on the keypunchers who make the government work, executing Musk’s belief that by controlling the computers, one could control the entire federal bureaucracy. They’ve mapped systems, reworked communication networks, and figured out the choke points. Instead of taking command of the existing workforce, Trump’s new team has pressured them to disperse, firing those who were probationary, offering buyouts to others, and subjecting many others to 15-minute interviews in what many felt were juvenile tests of their worth.\\n\\nThe full impact of the blitz will not be known for months, when the courts and Congress decide where to push back—if at all. But the scale and speed of the transformation now taking place across the executive branch are likely to leave a deep mark. The civil service is built on the caution that comes from layers of rules, with the knowledge that the American people directly depend on the services provided. Reliability, however creaky, is typically paramount. Musk’s broader operation started from the opposite premise: Radical action was the only responsible course. The improperly fired could be rehired. The confusing memo could be withdrawn and replaced. The courts might overturn their actions, but that is a problem for another day. Make change happen, and rebuild the smashed shards later, if necessary.\\n\\nThis story is based on interviews with more than 25 current and former government workers, most of whom requested anonymity to avoid retribution or public targeting. They told the story of a chaotic few weeks when DOGE and its allies infiltrated their offices, with an endgame that is still being written. The first month of Trump’s second term may be the start of a government transformation on par with Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal, fundamentally remaking the powers of the president under the emerging authority of digital data systems. Or it could be the start of a constitutional crisis and the fracturing of the government systems upon which Americans rely.\\n\\nThe White House maintains that the DOGE transformation is being done securely, in full compliance with the law. “DOGE has fully integrated into the federal government to cut waste, fraud, and abuse,” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told us in a statement. “Rogue bureaucrats and activist judges attempting to undermine this effort are only subverting the will of the American people, and their obstructionist efforts will fail.”\\n\\nPushback within the government has already started to emerge. A top GSA engineer resigned this week when faced with orders to turn over root access to Notify.gov, the system that government agencies use to send text messages to citizens, because the file contained personal information, according to an internal message we obtained.\\n\\nOutside observers have been watching with increasing anxiety, worried that the rush for change and the blunt-force methods will break something important that will hurt people who need services and take years to put back together.\\n\\n“You are controlling technology pipelines, which is the modern-day equivalent of blocking the highway. You are controlling any in and out flow,” Ayushi Roy, a former technologist at the General Services Administration who now teaches digital government at the Harvard Kennedy School, told us. “You have to know where the breaker is and what the right order of switches is to turn the thing back on. I don’t know that they know where all the breakers and the mains are for this house yet, and they are letting go of all the people who do know.”\\n\\nDemocrats like to call him “President Musk”—following polling that shows the world’s richest man is less popular than Trump, and holds powers that even one in five Republican voters disapprove of. But White House officials, who lionize Trump for a living, dismiss the attack as a fundamental misunderstanding.\\n\\nMusk is not the architect of the plan, they say, but its executor. Conservatives spent decades fantasizing about shrinking government down to the size at which it could be drowned in the bathtub. Musk’s big innovation is finding ways to get that done.\\n\\nRussell Vought, a co-author of Project 2025 and the new director of the Office of Management and Budget, laid out the mission shortly after the election, back when Musk was still getting used to his guesthouse at Trump’s private Mar-a-Lago club. Vought called for a return to a pre-Watergate mindset—“a radical constitutional perspective to be able to dismantle that bureaucracy in their power centers.” There would be three prongs of the attack, he told Tucker Carlson during a November 18 podcast.\\n\\nFirst, “the whole notion of an independent agency should be thrown out,” Vought said, giving the president complete control of the executive branch to impose his will. Second, the courts must be provoked to smash the idea that Congress directs spending. “Congress gets to set the ceiling. You can’t spend without a congressional appropriation, but you weren’t ever meant to be forced to spend it,” Vought said, dismissing the 1974 Impoundment Control Act, which basically decrees the opposite. Third, the protections of the civil service must end, making nearly all of the federal workforce at-will employees.\\n\\nThis is where Musk entered under the banner of cost reduction, a useful side effect of the larger project. His major contribution, repeated to Trump and his advisers down at Mar-a-Lago, was to reject thinking about government as a lawyer would—a collection of institutions bound by norms, laws, and rules, and controlled by policy and decree. The bureaucracy does not easily bend to white papers. “The government runs on computers” soon became a mantra repeated by Trump’s advisers, who found themselves in awe of his enthusiasm and speed, even as they expressed annoyance at having to constantly clean up his messes, according to two people familiar with the discussions.\\n\\nMusk began wearing a T-shirt around the White House that said Tech Support to drive home the point. “One of the biggest functions of the DOGE team is just making sure that the presidential executive orders are actually carried out,” Musk told Fox News in a joint interview with Trump on Tuesday.\\n\\nHis team focused on accessing the terminals, uncovering the button pushers, and taking control.\\n\\n“He is kind of going after the nerve center of government,” said Amanda Ballantyne, the director of the Technology Institute at the AFL-CIO. “It looks like he’s using data and IT systems as a backdoor way to gain considerable discretionary power without normal, legal oversight.”\\n\\nMusk recruited loyalists. They started with the data sets, the programs deep in the bowels of the government. They abided by no official hierarchy, and many of his employees worked out of a large conference room in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, their backpacks strewn about. Steve Davis, DOGE’s unofficial chief operating officer, was a former SpaceX engineer who once owned Mr. Yogato, a D.C. frozen-yogurt shop where customers could win discounts by singing a song.\\n\\nThe targets of DOGE takeovers were often among the most obscure outposts of the federal government. But each had something that Musk’s allies needed. In previous changes of government, the employees of the Bureau of Fiscal Service, the paymaster of the federal government, had waited months for the new administration to even discover their existence. Now they found themselves fielding questions from Musk’s team during the transition about how things worked.\\n\\nThe General Services Administration, long thought of as the government’s landlord, took on new importance as the repository of massive data sets—about grants, contracts, even the personal identity-verification cards that control access to federal buildings and workstations. The DOGE team sought access to the Integrated Data Retrieval System at the IRS, a point of entry for the tax-record master file and similar systems at the Social Security Administration.\\n\\nTechnologists who watched the work from the inside wondered if Musk had plans to impose new AI tools on the federal machine. They speculated about plans to create a massive “data lake” that connected the disparate bits and bytes of the federal government into one giant system. New Trump appointees tried to gain access to a U.S. Treasury system to stop payments from USAID, rather than simply ordering the agency to stop spending—a test case, perhaps, for mastering 23 percent of the U.S. GDP, the scale of the federal government, from a single keyboard.\\n\\nThomas Shedd, a former Tesla engineer recently appointed as director of Technology Transformation Services at GSA, suggested a broader plan in an all-hands meeting on February 3 that was recorded and later shared with The Atlantic. “We want to start implementing more AI at the agency level and be an example for how other agencies can start leveraging AI,” he said, providing AI-powered coding assistants and federal contract analysis as examples. The ambitions raised security concerns. Government systems are hardened against outside attack but remain vulnerable to insider threats, veteran federal employees warned. Centralizing data could raise the risk.\\n\\n“At present, every hacker in the world knows there are a small number of people new to federal service who hold the keys to access all US government payments, contracts, civil servant personal info, and more,” one recently departed federal technology official wrote in draft testimony for lawmakers. “DOGE is one romance scam away from a national security emergency.”\\n\\nWithout a master AI at hand, the Trump team has worked agency by agency. One of the first tasks when they arrive is to get a full list of its contracts and grants, a person familiar with the process told us. “They are kind of like freelance henchmen,” observed the departed technologist who has been speaking with current officials directly interacting with DOGE. “They are going on little missions that Elon and Steve Davis are telling them to go on.”\\n\\nTrump appointees have sometimes asked agency leaders for a one-line description of every contract, as well as who is responsible for it. Then they go through the list, highlighting contracts that they think might contradict one of Trump’s executive orders or require additional scrutiny. Those singled out then get put in different batches, by category, before ending up on the secretary’s desk, for a final determination.\\n\\nThe process is error-prone. Employees at CFPB warned the newcomers that the telephone hotline for consumer complaints, operated by a contractor, was mandated by law. But for one day last week, it went offline, infuriating people on the inside of the frozen agency. It was reinstalled a day later. In other cases, the cuts sparked congressional backlash from key Republican members, forcing reconsideration.\\n\\nAt the Treasury Department, one of the Trump team’s first steps was simply to print out Government Accountability Office reports and go through them line by line, implementing the GAO’s recommendations for cutting spending and more, said a person familiar with the methods. The new team could also search whole contract data sets for supposedly “woke” words such as equity and diversity to target their cuts.\\n\\nBut the promise of digital supremacy can go only so far. Trump’s advisers encountered systems of what the incumbent engineers called “spaghetti code,” the product not of any grand design but of decades of revisions under new administrations and legal edicts.\\n\\nMultiple agencies have as many as 20 to 30 different versions of code, sometimes decades old, a person familiar with the process told us. So even when one of Musk’s allies masters a system, the team cannot simply replicate it across the government. Musk has expressed disbelief at some of the government’s antiquated programs and the challenge of centralizing command and control. Speaking in the Oval Office last week, he described the process of manually retiring government employees using paperwork stored in an old limestone mine in Pennsylvania, marveling that the “time warp” system restricted how many bureaucrats could retire each month.\\n\\nGovernment veterans, who have spent decades toiling in the mines of government data, looked on knowingly. “If they are targeting the computer systems, when are they going to realize that the computers don’t work?” a veteran federal technologist asked us. “There are so many systems strapped together or held together by duct tape or literal humans. There are limitations to what you can do with a systems-first approach.”\\n\\nSome of the engineers at the U.S. Digital Service, a strike team of technologists where Musk embedded his new operation, dared to harbor initial optimism that Musk could build something better. On January 20, USDS had projects running in at least 15 different federal agencies, including improving online passport applications and helping the Department of Veterans Affairs upgrade its app.\\n\\nBut it soon became clear that they were not invited to this new party. There would be two teams, the newcomers and those already there.\\n\\nWithin weeks of Trump’s arrival, the new technology leadership was telling federal employees to consider a modest buyout offer that arrived in an email titled “Fork in the Road,” an echo of a similar offer Musk had written to staffers when he took over Twitter.\\n\\n“In recent years, priorities have shifted from efficiency to ideology, and the agency has strayed from its mission,” Stephen Ehikian, the acting director of the GSA and a former Salesforce executive, wrote in an email to staff on Inauguration Day. Under his leadership, GSA could expect a “return” to “making government work smarter and faster, not larger and slower.”\\n\\n“It was different in tone from anything I’ve heard from a government official,” one GSA worker told us. “It was very much: ‘You all have been slacking off, and we’re going to stop that.’”\\n\\nProbationary employees, including veterans of government service who had just taken new roles, were targeted as the easiest to dismiss, in many cases regardless of their qualifications. In at least one instance, a federal technology employee never received notice of apparent termination, the person said. The official’s computer and email were disabled. A supervisor thought initially that there might be an IT glitch. The word from human resources was to wait. Then the paychecks stopped.\\n\\nFederal coders and product managers found themselves called into 15-minute interviews with the Musk newcomers, who were sometimes young enough to be their children and had a fraction of their experience. Employees received calendar invites to virtual meetings with nongovernment email addresses, were given only hours’ notice, and some were first asked to fill out a form describing recent “wins” and “blockers.”\\n\\nThe questions hit the same points across agencies, typically with variations on the wording—a request for a greatest-hits list of what employees had done, a probing of their capabilities. “Like, what’s your superpower?” a young Musk acolyte asked in an interview with one GSA employee, according to a recording obtained by The Atlantic. Some got quick coding tests. Others reported hearing questions that sounded like loyalty tests about what they thought of DOGE.\\n\\nThe uncertainty and chaos has left thousands of federal employees wondering what comes next and whether it will make more sense.\\n\\nLast Wednesday, when a U.S. District Court judge’s ruling allowed the “Fork” buyout program to proceed, Department of Energy employees received an email at 7:18 p.m. alerting them of the ruling and saying they had until 11:59 p.m. that evening to make a decision about whether to resign, according to a copy of the email provided to us.\\n\\nAt approximately 8 p.m., Energy Department staff received another email saying that “the Deferred Resignation Program is now closed” and that any resignations received after 7:20 p.m.—just two minutes after the initial email went out—would not be accepted.\\n\\nOne Energy Department employee told us that he’d been on the phone with fellow department staff, everyone agonizing over what to do, when the second email came in saying that, despite the midnight deadline, the window had already shut. He later told us that resignations had, in fact, been accepted until midnight.\\n\\nThe amateurish errors caused unnecessary chaos and scrambling in an already uncertain time, leaving many government employees wondering if casual cruelty was as much the point as the government overhaul itself.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'is a senior technology correspondent at Vox. He’s spent 15 years covering the intersection of technology, culture, and politics at places like Gizmodo, Vice, and the Atlantic.\\n\\nThe software we need to stop spam texts is being outpaced by the software used to generate them.\\ufeff Getty Images\\n\\nAs soon as I sat down to write this, I got a text that simply said, “Hi.” In another era, I may have been intrigued by the mysterious message from an unknown number. Maybe I would’ve been curious about who wanted to say hello, and texted back. But this is not my first time playing this game.\\n\\nScam texts are a growing multibillion-dollar industry. As robocalls become less common — thanks, in part, to a 2009 law that forced phone companies to do more to stop them — complaints about text scams increased 500 percent from 2015 to 2022. While it’s hard to nail down an exact number of spam messages sent in a given day, the problem is getting worse. It’s not just that you’re getting bombarded with more text scams than ever. The texts are also starting to get really sophisticated.\\n\\nVox Technology Dispatches from senior correspondent Adam Clark Estes about how technology is changing the world — and how it’s changing us. Email (required) Sign Up By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice . This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\\n\\nI’d like to say I’ve never clicked on a link in a spam text, but I’d be lying. Maybe it was about an issue with a mysterious package or an unpaid parking ticket or some political thing — it doesn’t really matter. With so much of our personal data now appearing online and with the help of AI, text scams are getting smarter, more targeted, and more dangerous. The software we need to stop spam texts is being outpaced by the software used to generate them, which does not bode well for our ever-evolving relationship with technology.\\n\\nSo that’s the bad news and the worse news. The good news is that humans are, so far, smarter than the machines. With a combination of savvy and software, you can reduce your exposure to text scams or, at the very least, your likelihood of actually becoming the victim of a scam.\\n\\nRobocalls don’t seem so bad in retrospect\\n\\nAnother text scam I got this week involved an alleged unpaid toll, with a link to pay and a friendly sign-off (“The Toll Roads team wishes you a great day!”). As it happens, I probably do owe somebody money for an unpaid toll, but it’s not “The Toll Roads team.” The link in the text, which ended in “.world”, was the biggest red flag. I did not click this link, but if the text had been more personalized — perhaps by using my name or mentioning that the toll was in the state of New York, where I live — maybe I would have.\\n\\nThis is where we’re heading. Common scams, like those involving unpaid fines, job recruiters, the IRS, and undelivered packages, can become exponentially more dangerous if they include your personal details, including your email and home address. And following years of data breaches, a growing amount of data about you is available for scammers to leverage. Meanwhile, generative AI makes it easy for bad actors to craft convincing, typo-free messages on a massive scale. Sometimes all you have to do is read the text to give the scammer more leverage.\\n\\nCommon scams, like those involving unpaid fines, job recruiters, the IRS, and undelivered packages, can become exponentially more dangerous if they include your personal details.\\n\\n“Depending on what your read receipts are like, then the bad guy might know that you opened the text,” Teresa Murray, a consumer watchdog at the US PIRG Education Fund, told me. “And then, God forbid, if you click on any links or anything like that, or call the number that’s on the text, then it’s off to the races.”\\n\\nThere are multiple ways for scammers to win here. If you click a link, you could be tricked into giving them money or misled into giving up more personal information, which is its own currency in the fraud marketplace. Many text scams are also phishing schemes, and the links point to a webpage designed to steal your login credentials. At best, clicking the link proves to bad actors that you’re alive and willing to go along with the scheme.\\n\\nRelated Gen Z falls for online scams more than their boomer grandparents do\\n\\nThe total amount of money lost to phone scammers in 2024 was over $25 billion, which works out to an average of about $450 per victim. Older adults are actually less likely to fall for certain scams, mostly because they’ve learned not to pick up their phones. The vast majority of Americans over 65 say they don’t answer if they don’t recognize the number, and 57 percent of the same group have put their names on the national Do Not Call registry — a database run by the Federal Trade Commission since 2003 — according to a recent report from the call blocking service Truecaller.\\n\\nYounger Americans have it worse. The same report found that people between the ages of 18 and 44 are three times as likely as older Americans to fall for phone scams, including spam texts, and 25 percent of that group have reported being a victim more than once. Only 30 percent of them say they’re on the Do Not Call registry.\\n\\nWhat you can and can’t do to escape text scams\\n\\nBecause it was designed to stop unwanted calls from telemarketers, the Do Not Call registry doesn’t do too much to cut down on spam texts. Furthermore, many of those texts come from abroad, and without an international phone police patrolling the lines, a scammer running a SIM farm in Southeast Asia can blow up your phone with alerts about undelivered packages to their heart’s content.\\n\\nSIM farms, also known as phone farms or SIM banks, are systems equipped with multiple SIM cards that can send large numbers of texts or place calls simultaneously, and cost just a few hundred dollars to set up. It’s virtually free for scammers to acquire phone numbers, and unlike robocalls, which happen in real-time, spam texts get sent in big batches in a split second. If a number gets blocked, the scammer can just start using a new number and keep spamming. Now, they can also use generative AI to craft more convincing, personalized messages.\\n\\nMeanwhile, phone companies face fewer regulatory requirements to protect their customers from these spam texts. The TRACED Act, which was implemented in 2021, gave the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) tools to prevent robocalls, including a caller ID verification framework called STIR/SHAKEN. But it wasn’t until 2024 that the FCC enacted its first rule specifically targeting spam texts.\\n\\nYou’d think that stopping spam texts should be as easy as using a spam filter, like email providers have been doing for decades. But text messages are not nearly as sophisticated as email technology. The basic technology — SMS, or Short Message Service — dates back to the 1980s and is hardly secure.\\n\\n“SMS lacks built-in security controls, such as email authentication protocols,” Adam Meyers, head of counter adversary operations at the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, explained in an email. “While phone carriers and software makers implement filters and blocking mechanisms, adversaries constantly evolve their tactics.”\\n\\nThe challenge is to filter out the unwanted messages, without blocking legitimate ones. That means distinguishing texts from your friends, your bank, your DoorDash driver, or your new friend who’s not yet in your contacts list from spam texts.\\n\\nMany companies and organizations also do send legitimate messages in bulk, using short codes — five- or six-digit numbers that must be registered with the CTIA, the wireless industry’s trade association, which also governs how people can interact with these texts.\\n\\nPro tip: Don’t delete trusted messages You probably get tons of automated messages from trusted sources, like your pharmacy, bank, or food delivery service. That also includes verification codes if you use your phone number for two-factor authentication as well as texts from short codes, including political campaigns. Don’t delete these messages right away. This way, if you get a new message from a trusted source, it will likely show up in the same thread and spare you the stress of wondering if it’s the real deal. “Even better: Go ahead and put a label on it, put it in your contacts,” said PIRG’s Teresa Murray. “And then if you get what looks like a verification code from XYZ bank, but it’s not coming from the saved contact, then that could be a red flag for you.”\\n\\nUnfortunately, scammers don’t care much for laws or rules, and phone companies will only do so much to combat the never-ending torrent of spam texts. It costs money to build filters that can attempt to keep up with the scammers’ methods, and some carriers include those tools in the cost of their service. Others charge for better tools. Verizon, for instance, offers basic filters for free, and “plus” filters for an extra $4 a month.\\n\\n“It’s real work to do this. There’s a significant amount of analysis,” Alex Quilici, CEO of the call-blocking service YouMail, told me. “I’m sympathetic, but carriers have a fairly hard problem.”\\n\\nWhen it comes to avoiding text scams, you have options. In addition to whatever your carrier offers, there are apps like Truecaller, TextKiller, RoboKiller, and Hiya.\\n\\nI’ve never paid for one of these services, so I can’t say how well they work. I can say that not answering your phone continues to be a solid way to avoid robocallers — and a great way to miss a call from your doctor’s office. Caller ID can be easily spoofed, so don’t pick up if you’re not expecting a call. If in doubt, skip the call, and call the legitimate number back.\\n\\nThe most important thing to do is not engage with scammers. Even if they’re saying “Hi” and seem friendly, responding to or even reading a spam text just tells the bad actor that you’re a real human and a target. For now, know that you’re smarter than the AI, and ignore it.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has put the decades-old debate over water fluoridation back on the table. As President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for Health and Human Services secretary, he might become the most powerful public health figure in the US who believes we should take fluoride out of our water. Currently, it’s up to municipalities to set their own water fluoride doses — most of them set them around 0.7 milligrams per liter of water — so it’s unclear whether a federal agency will be able to change course on water fluoridation in the US. About 63 percent of Americans have fluoridated water. Millions of Americans also drink water that is naturally fluoridated at even higher levels.\\n\\nThe video explains how this renewed attention on water fluoridation is happening at a time when new science is emerging on the topic. Historically, water fluoridation has done wonders for combatting tooth decay, primarily in children. But scientists are looking into whether it’s still having the same effect today, given how widespread topical fluoride and regular dental care is now.\\n\\nThere is a growing scientific debate about whether the doses we are exposed to in the US are safe for developing brains.\\n\\nPart of the difficulty of the science on fluoride is that when it comes to studying fluoride’s risks, there has never been a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study — the gold standard in science for proving causation. All of the studies we mention in the video are observational. This lack of study is typical in epidemiology when researching something that could be harmful in some doses. But surprisingly, there’s never been this kind of trial on the benefits of water fluoridation, either. However, the University of North Carolina is currently conducting the first-ever trial of this kind on the benefits of water fluoridation.\\n\\nIt’s worth noting that this video talks about studies that look at the link between childhood IQ and high fluoride levels. These types of studies are done on a population level — so, averaging IQ across a large group. The study of IQ is problematic in some scenarios. But one expert I spoke to explained why it’s the best tool epidemiologists have for doing this type of research.\\n\\n“Historically, there have been concerns about how IQ is racially biased,“ Bruce Lanphear, a professor of health sciences at Simon Fraser University, told me. “But in fact, probably of all the different measures we use for brain function broadly, IQ is the optimal one we use. In contrast with some of the behavioral scores … which are most typically based upon parent report. And those are valuable and they’ve been validated. But IQ is not only validated, it’s been shown to work consistently, at least within homogeneous groups.”'},\n",

But not all those ideas and communities are benevolent. It can be hard to separate harmful movements from aspirational ones, but it’s easy to exploit those who mistake one for the other.\\n\\nThroughout tech culture, this exploitation frequently generates dogmatic thinking and rigid adherence to a leader or idea — on the most extreme end, you have a group like the “Zizians,” followers of a “post-rationalist” leader named Ziz. The cultlike Zizians are allegedly responsible for a string of violence across the country: at least six confirmed deaths — three within the last month alone — two alleged suicides, and one disappearance. Just last week, Ziz and another group member were arrested in Maryland, charged with multiple minor offenses. Larger indictments seem likely to follow.\\n\\nRationalism is a centuries-old philosophical belief that elevates reason over intuition or faith. Modern-day rationalists are often fixated on how we prepare for the Singularity — the moment when, in theory, AI will gain sentience — and it’s in this sense that rationalism has profoundly influenced Silicon Valley. Rationalism takes a fundamentally optimistic, if limiting, approach toward human co-existence with AI.\\n\\nPost-rationalists, by contrast, tend to think an evil, world-destroying AI is inevitable. A post-rationalist leans into contrarianism, spiritualism, and preparing for the worst. This bleak cocktail has proved heady for the Zizians, encouraging them to embrace grandiose moral frameworks alongside self-destructive ideas like sleeping with half your brain.\\n\\nIt’s also led the group to a headline-making spree of bizarre crimes and murders, all with an elusive leader at the center.\\n\\nA boat, a blog, and a post-rationalist dream\\n\\nZiz LaSota joined the rationalist community through its lodestar online forum LessWrong in 2012, when she was in her early 20s. She attended at least one workshop hosted by the Center for Applied Rationality (CFAR), a rationalist offshoot that some have accused of being cult-like itself, and which in 2014 faced backlash as part of unproven, anonymous child sex-trafficking allegations against its parent group, the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI). In 2016, Ziz moved to the Bay Area from Alaska and gathered a small community to live on boats in the San Francisco Bay to avoid paying rent. The boats were short-lived; the community — most of whom were vegan and trans like Ziz — and what grew out of it, persists in some form to this day.\\n\\nShe soon started a niche but attention-getting blog (since deleted but mirrored here) where she divided people into categories like “living,” “vampire,” and “zombie.” She was obsessed with willpower, seemed to view psychopathy as liberational and aspirational, and claimed mind control. “Sometimes cops harass me for wearing my religious attire as a Sith,” she wrote, referring to wielders of the dark Force in Star Wars.\\n\\nOn her blog, Ziz peddled “unihemispheric sleep” (UHS), a real but very unhealthy practice in which people attempt to rest only one half of their brain at a time. Sleep deprivation is a tactic religious cults have long used to render their followers psychologically vulnerable; in this case, it tied into Ziz’s theory that the left and right brain separated people into two different identities.\\n\\nAccording to Ziz, humans could exist as two entirely different people, even entirely separate genders with different states of awareness and capacities. (This is very similar to the TV show Severance and a lot like the “two wolves” meme brought to life.) Ziz claimed that these divided inner selves had different cores that were either “good” or “nongood.” The likelihood of a person’s two cores both being good, or “double good,” was infinitesimal. Naturally, she herself was double good.\\n\\nIn her comment section, people now seriously debated the merits of Ziz’s ideas. Some had taken workshops through CFAR, but often directed negative attention their way now. Many commenters were highly educated and working in tech; one was building future-prediction apps and algorithms.\\n\\nYou might not think this sounds rooted in rationalism at all — or even post-rationalism, with its renewed interest in intuition and “woo stuff.” But in fact, modern-day rationalism cultivates all types of wild thinking. On top of having been popularized in its current incarnation through a Harry Potter fanfic, the belief system abounds with fantastical thought experiments, like Roko’s Basilisk — in which a vengeful future AI punishes those who did not help to create it.\\n\\nZiz frequently extrapolated these lines of thinking, weaponizing them into potentially dangerous mindsets. “Zizians do not think it is ever valid to surrender,” one pseudonymous ex-Zizian wrote. “Giving in is choosing a strategy that gets coerced into surrender.”\\n\\nHow a protest about child sex-trafficking upped the stakes\\n\\nBy 2019, Ziz and a handful of her acolytes had transitioned from houseboats to living in an RV lot in Vallejo, another city in the Bay Area, owned by an elderly landlord named Curtis Lind. A nebulous cluster of dedicated followers who had found her through her blog continued to interact with her and the other community members online.\\n\\nThat year, Ziz began claiming that the allegations against MIRI were true and that higher-ups had been blackmailed into a payout. This all led to Ziz shutting down a CFAR alumni reunion in Occidental, California, “to protest the coverup of child molestation” by CFAR attendants, according to court documents. Ziz and followers showed up to the retreat wearing robes and Anonymous-style masks and blocked the entrance. A SWAT team later detained them amid disputed reports that protesters were armed.\\n\\nThese arrests, and the stacked charges that accompanied them, opened a new chapter — one in which her followers drowned in attorneys’ fees and she dodged court hearings as her notoriety spread. By this point, rationalists had begun posting warnings to the community, describing Ziz as dangerous and cult leader-like and referring to her followers as “Zizians.” The growing perception that her influence was toxic may have been boosted by the deaths of former members, including Maia Pasek, who allegedly died by suicide in 2018 while intensely practicing UHS. Ziz later wrote a long blog post alleging that Pasek was “nongood” and had been performing UHS incorrectly.\\n\\nThen there was Jay Winterford, an ex-Zizian who rounded-up testimonials against Ziz. Winterford died in 2021, reportedly by suicide, after which Ziz wrote a comment generally believed to be about Winterford, saying she had spent “7 months, most of every day in a desperate (and mutual) mental battle, of trying to get in [Winterford’s] head.” Ziz also allegedly weaponized her own followers. A follower named Jamie Zajko appeared to claim that Ziz had pressured her for weeks to murder another ex-Zizian. “I’m writing this, so if Alice and I die or vanish, everyone knows who is responsible,” Zajko wrote.\\n\\nWhen the pandemic hit in 2020, the Vallejo Zizians allegedly stopped paying rent. (Ziz later wrote that paying rent was “bad praxis.”) Lind began a years-long eviction process, during which the Zizians allegedly took over the property. Meanwhile, Ziz skipped court. In August 2022, lawyers representing Ziz and a long-time follower named Gwen Danielson in a countersuit over the CFAR incident filed motions claiming Ziz had died after falling overboard earlier that month, and that Danielson was believed to have died by suicide (though prosecutors were skeptical). Ziz’s obituary was released under her birth name.\\n\\nShe wouldn’t remain dead for long.\\n\\nA standoff in California — and a double murder in Pennsylvania\\n\\nIn the wee hours of November 13, 2022, the dispute between Lind and his Vallejo tenants erupted. The Zizians were due to be evicted in two days, and claimed Lind had been harassing them. According to a friend of Lind’s, several tenants lured him outside his home. Those present included Zizians Suri Dao, Somni Leatham, and Emma Borhanian. A prosecutor later claimed Ziz was also there, “alive and well.”\\n\\nIn one version, when Lind stepped outside, the tenants attacked. In another, Lind started shooting, unprovoked. What’s undisputed is that someone stabbed Lind repeatedly with a samurai sword, ultimately blinding him in one eye, and that he also shot two of the tenants, seriously injuring Leatham and fatally shooting Borhanian.\\n\\nPolice charged Dao and Leatham with the murder of their friend and Lind’s attempted murder; they’re still in detention and have each repeatedly attempted to escape.\\n\\nOn the other side of the country, Jamie Zajko — the follower Ziz had allegedly pressured to commit murder — was also facing police scrutiny. In early January 2023, her parents, Rita and Richard Zajko, were shot to death in their home in Chester Heights, Pennsylvania, around the same time as an argument during which neighbors’ surveillance allegedly captured screams of “Mom!” Police interviewed Jamie Zajko’s roommate, a man named Daniel Blank, in connection to the crime. Shortly after, Ziz was found hiding in a hotel with Blank and Zajko and detained on a $500,000 bail in connection with obstruction and disorderly conduct charges, but then released. Police failed to find enough evidence to bring indictments against any of the trio.\\n\\nBy this point, the group was in disarray. One Zizian, Borhanian, was dead; one, Zajko, was on the lam; and two more were missing. Blank had dropped out of contact with friends; his profile was uploaded to the national missing persons database in 2023. Danielson had allegedly faked her death, but she, too, had fallen off the public radar around the same time as Blank. The last known contact with her was reportedly with family over the holidays in 2024; her father told the San Francisco Chronicle that she broke away from the group and went into hiding, and he fears for her safety.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Dao and Leatham were still in detention, their trial still looming. Because evidence was scarce, Lind’s testimony at trial would be vital to the case.\\n\\nThree new Zizians, three new deaths\\n\\nEnter three more Zizians living in the same neighborhood in North Carolina — a genderfluid woman named Teresa Youngblut, who also went by Milo; their partner Maximilian Snyder, who also went by Audere; and Ophelia Bauckholt, who moved to the US from Germany around the time of the Zajko murders. Like many in the group, they were highly intelligent: Snyder studied philosophy at the University of Oxford while Bauckholt was a successful Wall Street stock trader. (Zajko has a degree in bioinformatics and had been a research intern at a Philadelphia hospital studying, ironically, sleep deprivation.)\\n\\nOver several days in early January 2025, witnesses noticed a person in all black looming around Lind’s Vallejo residence. On January 17, Lind was killed. Snyder was arrested on January 24 and charged with the murder in a stabbing death, with the criminal complaint alleging Lind was killed to prevent him from testifying.\\n\\nShortly before Lind’s death, Youngblut and Bauckholt traveled to Vermont. The pair drew attention by dressing in all black and carrying a handgun. (Officials believe Zajko, still dodging authorities, gave them firearms she’d purchased the year before.) Authorities reportedly surveilled the duo for days as they visited Newport, Vermont, and looked at property in the area.\\n\\nRelated 9 wild cult stories to get lost in\\n\\nFinally, on January 20, things came to a head: Approached by a border agent named David Maland, Youngblut allegedly pointed a Glock at him and fired it at least twice. In the ensuing shootout, Youngblut was shot, and both Maland and Bauckholt were killed. Authorities later described finding a weapons cache in the car the pair were driving, as well as “48 rounds of .380-calibre jacketed hollow point bullets, a ballistic helmet, and night vision equipment.”\\n\\nYoungblut was promptly arrested and is facing federal charges. On February 16, Ziz, Zajko, and Blank were all apprehended by authorities in Maryland. The trio were arrested on charges including trespassing and obstructing law enforcement. Blank’s arrest marked the first time he had been located since being reported missing, according to a lawyer at a pretrial hearing in which all three were detained without bail. Ziz told the judge, “I haven’t done anything wrong.” The death toll seemingly associated with Ziz and her followers now stands at six.\\n\\nHow are we supposed to think about all this bloodshed?\\n\\nIt might seem that Ziz masterminded all this mayhem, but it’s unclear how much direct involvement she had. Is this, as the Daily Mail has proclaimed, a “trans death cult”? Are the Zizians simply loosely connected murderous individuals? Something in-between?\\n\\n“There’s no organization, there’s no centralization. It’s not like we all have Ziz on speed-dial and ask her what to do every day,” a Zizian called Octavia Nouzen said in an interview she gave to a podcaster who goes by Uncle Kenny, who has extensively investigated the Zizians. “It doesn’t take a mysterious cult leader with infohazards and brainwashing and all this spooky stuff to make these bad things happen — there’s other contingent circumstances.”\\n\\nThe Zizians are far from the only extremist thought community that’s embedded itself within tech culture.\\n\\nOne major factor in the Zizian radicalization seems to be the way rationalism and post-rationalism encourage adherents to adopt ever more arcane, fantasy-infused worldviews which can easily turn dangerous. “At the time, my left hemisphere was a revenant and my right hemisphere a lich; and yeah my phylactery shattered, but what ended up happening was that part of me started fading towards zombiedom for many months, before rebuilding a phylactery and restoring lichdom,” goes a typical comment on Ziz’s blog; this one happens to be from Danielson before she disappeared.\\n\\nIn the middle of a passionate defense of the Vallejo tenants, one supporter breaks away to invoke the modern rationalist ur-text Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, declaring, “You know that scene from HPMOR where Harry does everything he can to save Hermione, but she dies anyway? This was like that, but so much worse because it really happened.”\\n\\nThe Zizians are far from the only extremist thought community that’s embedded itself within tech culture; some are arguably even influencing high-level decisions that are being made about humanity’s near- and long-term future. We have yet to fully grapple with the darker implications of this much obscure ideology impacting our societal development, as well as the immediate effects at an individual level. It’s heartbreaking to read Maia Pasek’s alleged suicide note and see her using the framework of rationalist decision theory to posit her own existence as a question of simple logic or non-logic.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Government websites have undergone massive changes since President Donald Trump returned to office.\\n\\nSome of the changes are routine — like swapping out the current president and vice president for their predecessors on the White House’s official site.\\n\\nBut other changes go much further. Several sites — like USAID.gov, ReproductiveRights.gov, and the Spanish-language version of WhiteHouse.gov — have gone offline. Remaining sites have been scrubbed of certain data and terminology in order to comply with Trump’s executive orders targeting “gender ideology” and DEI.\\n\\nIt’s an acceleration of a problem known as digital decay — or linkrot. Large quantities of the internet are disappearing as media outlets go under, companies upgrade their web infrastructure, or organizations take down information they believe is no longer valuable or relevant. A recent Pew Research Center study found that 38 percent of webpages that existed in 2013 are no longer available. Because so much of our culture now happens online, losing those pages means losing part of the record of ourselves.\\n\\nToday, Explained Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins. Email (required) Sign Up By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice . This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\\n\\nMark Graham, director of the Wayback Machine, joined Sean Rameswaram on Today, Explained to talk about digital decay, what his team is doing to combat the problem both generally and during Trump’s second term, and why internet preservation is so important.\\n\\nBelow is an excerpt of the conversation, edited for length and clarity. There’s much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Stitcher.\\n\\nFor people who have maybe stumbled upon your website but don’t really know what you do, can you give them a sense of the things that you guys have saved in 30 years?\\n\\nWhere do I begin? It’s like walking into a very large library and saying, “Show me your favorite book.”\\n\\nLast year, there was a big news story that MTV News was shut down. The founding editor wrote about it on LinkedIn, and there were a lot of other editors talking about it: “My God, all of our articles are gone. They’re missing.” And I just casually waded into the conversation and went, “Hi, um … check the Wayback Machine.”\\n\\nThey were like, ‘Oh my God, you guys got it all. What did you do?’ We didn’t do anything when the site went down because we’ve been doing our job all along. We’ve been working to archive the public web, as it’s published, on an ongoing continuous basis. If we have to start paying attention to something after it’s gone down, that means we screwed up.\\n\\nSo what are you guys doing in advance of these sites going down to make sure that people can find out what Everlast was singing about in 2004?\\n\\nWe set our web crawlers and archiving software out on a mission every day to identify and to download web pages and related web-based resources. We bring in millions and millions of URLs every day that are signals of where new material is being published on the web. And we make sure that we archive all of those URLs and all the web pages associated with those URLs.\\n\\nThen, we look at those pages, and we identify links to other pages. And then we go to those pages and we archive them. That’s where you get this metaphor of crawling like a spider throughout this web.\\n\\nThe net result of it is that we add more than a billion archived URLs to the Wayback Machine every day. This material that’s added to the Wayback Machine is indexed and it’s immediately available to people who go to web dot archive.org and enter in a URL. They are then able to see a history of archives that we have of that web page that was available from the URL at any given time.\\n\\n“That’s where you get this metaphor of crawling like a spider throughout this web.”\\n\\nI want to talk about government websites, because that’s the reason we’re having this conversation today. I think most people probably think the government will take care of archiving government websites. But here we are in a new administration and websites are disappearing, coming back online, and people are worried. When you — an archivist of the internet — see this happening, how do you react to that? Is it better or worse than regular, non-governmental websites going offline?\\n\\nWell, as an American, my tax dollars help pay for some of this stuff and much of it is a benefit to people. Certainly my first reaction is: That might not be such a good thing.\\n\\nI do want to underscore that the National Archives and Records Administration does do archiving as well, and the Library of Congress. So it’s not like we’re the only game in town. But for whatever reason, we seem to be one of the main players in the space of trying to archive much of the public web, including — and right now, especially — US government websites and making those archives available in near real time.\\n\\nWere you caught off-guard when you saw the new administration removing web pages, removing websites?\\n\\nIn some respects, this is normal and expected. It’s what’s happened, frankly, for each administration in the time that we’ve been working on this effort. I mean, look, it’s under new management, right? You wouldn’t expect the WhiteHouse.gov website under any new presidential administration to be the same as it was before. You’re going to see the bios of the people that are part of the current administration, the news of that administration. We go out of our way to try to anticipate the frequency in which web pages should be archived so that we have a pretty good shot at getting those changes.\\n\\nYou’re saying that the WhiteHouse.gov site obviously changes administration to administration. I think to some degree people understand that: Joe Biden’s administration probably wouldn’t have been posting trolly Valentines about immigration to their Instagram account a year ago. But what we’re seeing here is websites that people need — websites that record public health information going offline — briefly, permanently, what have you.\\n\\nIs that a different degree of erasing the historical record — or messing with the historical record — than we’ve seen?\\n\\nThat’s true. It is. It’s different. It’s certainly different in terms of the number [of changes] — seemingly! We’re still in the early stages of this administration, but yeah, I’d say on the face of it, you’re right. Historically, we haven’t seen major US government websites taken offline like we did, for example, with regard to USAID. But I’m going to leave that kind of analysis to others, and really just focus on trying to archive the material.\\n\\nThe Wayback Machine and the Internet Archive are mostly funded through donations: the generosity of people, institutions, even governments. Is that going to be enough to archive the internet to the extent that future generations will want and need?\\n\\n“Enough” is a very subjective term. As an archivist, for me, it’s never enough. I don’t know, and no one knows, what is going to be of use, value, importance in the future — maybe even the near future of tomorrow, much less the very far-off future. Since millions of people use our site on a daily basis, we get a lot of feedback from them. It motivates us, but it also helps direct us and inspires us to continuously try to do a better job at being the best library that we can be.\\n\\n“As an archivist, for me, it’s never enough.”\\n\\nYou guys have been at this for nearly three decades. Certainly, you’ve saved a lot of stuff. Certainly, a lot of stuff has fallen through the cracks. I wonder, is there something that slipped through the cracks that might suggest to our audience what is lost when we can’t archive to the extent we want to, or need to?\\n\\nOkay, I got one! This is just in recent history. Apparently there was a page up on the CDC website about bird flu last week that was only up for a few minutes, and no one got it.\\n\\nAnd by losing that fleeting web page, that one maybe minor, maybe major web page about bird flu on the CDC website, what are we losing?\\n\\nWell, we’re losing part of the story, right? We’re losing part of our understanding of the evolution of arguably a significant health issue. We don’t know where this is going to go. I guess that’s the other point, right? You don’t know now what is going to be very important in the near or longer term.\\n\\nIn the time of Martin Luther, there were raging debates. Much of that debate took the form of things that were written on pamphlets. The pamphlets at the time were considered of little value: People read them and they shared them, but they didn’t necessarily save them. So today, a scholar of that time — or someone like me, who is strangely curious — what I would give for a collection of those pamphlets.\\n\\nYou are comparing, in a way, a CDC website to the Protestant Reformation. But I think you mean it, don’t you?'},\n",

       "   'content': 'One of the big challenges of reporting on the new administration is that it’s hard to figure out who’s really calling the shots. Take AI. In his comments to world leaders at the AI Action Summit in Paris last week, Vice President JD Vance laid out one view of where the Trump administration should go on AI: “This administration will ensure that American AI technology continues to be the gold standard worldwide and we are the partner of choice for others — foreign countries and certainly businesses — as they expand their own use of AI.”\\n\\nHe specifically spoke about the importance of America having its own advanced semiconductor design industry. Right now, there’s a desperate scramble in the AI industry to source enough of the advanced computer chips on which AI systems run. They’re an essential technology, and building them in America is a reasonable priority whether you’re concerned about the capabilities of advanced AI, conventional war with China that would dampen semiconductor imports, or reshoring manufacturing.\\n\\nVance’s speech was bullish on AI: Based on his remarks, I expected that while many features of Biden administration-era AI policy, like concerns about AI-generated misinformation, were probably on the outs, the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act — which encouraged the development of an advanced American semiconductor industry, and restricted exports of advanced semiconductors — was here to stay. And so far the CHIPS project has been going quite well. So I expected the administration to stick with it or even double down.\\n\\nThis story was first featured in the Future Perfect newsletter. Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.\\n\\nTrump officials might still do so. But it’s now hard to tell, because of the actions of a different arm of the new administration: DOGE. As you’ve surely heard by now, Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency is across many government departments systematically firing all probationary employees — that is, broadly anyone who was hired or promoted in the last year. That includes most of the people in the government who have been hired to work on AI, including a majority of the staff working on implementing the CHIPS Act, Axios reported this week, citing conversations with sources familiar with the decision. Per Axios, “74 postdocs, 57% of CHIPS staff focused on incentives,” and “67% of CHIPS staff focused on R&D” were slated to be fired. (It appears the cuts haven’t happened yet, so it’s still very possible the admin will reverse course or limit their scope.)\\n\\nTo be clear: This isn’t a targeted cut. It’s not that the administration has decided to reverse course on CHIPS. It’s just that, in the course of firing every single recent hire across broad swathes of the government, Musk’s team may by accident fire all of the recent expertise that has been accumulated around AI.\\n\\nAI moves fast\\n\\nAt the start of the Biden administration, almost no one outside Silicon Valley was talking about AI. Even by the 2022 midterm elections, we were still pre-ChatGPT. It is only in the past two years that AI has begun to turn the world upside down.\\n\\nFirst there was ChatGPT, and then the scramble from every other major tech company in the US to produce a competitor: DALL-E 2 and then Midjourney, and a flowering of other open-source AI art generators, drove artists out of business and transformed the visual content available on the internet. Then came DeepSeek and other AI models that can “reason,” and now Deep Research, which many people have said can essentially replace research interns.\\n\\nBecause it has all happened in the space of two years, all of the government hires focused on grappling with our new AI-powered world are new hires — including not just the ones working on CHIPS, but also everybody at the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s AI Safety Institute, which does AI research and tests the risks and capabilities of commercial AI models. And that means most of them are probationary hires who are likely to be impacted by DOGE’s rampage through the federal government.\\n\\nThis is an extremely stupid problem to have. If the administration wants to give up on an advanced semiconductors industry in the US, that’s one thing. But if the administration wants to have an advanced semiconductors industry to remain competitive on the most important technology of the 21st century, as Vance said it does last week, it is absurd to give it up because it so happens that we hired most of the people who work on it quite recently.\\n\\nOne of the ways that AI poses an unprecedented challenge for the government is just how fast it moves. It’s hardly the first technology to obviate lots of jobs, or to dramatically change the way other jobs work. But the faster those transitions happen, the more lives they can damage in their wake, and the harder it is for democratic mechanisms of oversight and regulation to function. If AI were going to happen slowly, gradually changing the way we live and work over the next 30 years, I’d be fairly optimistic that we’d have plenty of time to course correct, learn, and design appropriate laws.\\n\\nBut AI is happening very fast, and the US government — which is not generally very good at doing things fast — has been continually on the back foot. And DOGE looks liable to make that a lot worse — not even through malice, but through inattention. Firing people is a lot faster than hiring them; freezing funding is a lot faster than figuring out where it can be put to best use. But with AI, we need to be able to accumulate expertise quickly, act on it quickly, and stay abreast of the pace of change in the private sector. DOGE was originally conceived as an agency that would make that easier. But so far, they’re making it harder.\\n\\nIt seems very likely to me that world-transforming AI will arrive during the current administration, technology that may replace tens of millions of jobs overnight, that will represent a massive change in concentration of power in our society, and that experts warn could go fatally wrong. Vance isn’t wrong about the upsides. Musk, who believes there’s a very real chance that AI will destroy humanity, isn’t wrong about the downsides. But they’re both going to have to get serious if they want their administration in a position to make this go well.'},\n",

Previously, she wrote for the Daily Beast and contributed to several publications, including Vulture, W Magazine, and Bitch Media.\\n\\nKim Kardashian’s career has been one big guessing game. Since founding the extremely successful shapewear company Skims in 2019, the reality-star-turned-lifestyle-influencer has embarked on a number of surprising if not totally puzzling ventures, from trying to become a lawyer to starring in a poorly rated season of American Horror Story to filming an eerie “Santa Baby” music video. Thanks to her recent Instagram activity, though, her followers have already started to suspect her next move.\\n\\nThe theory is that Kardashian is making a rightward turn, cozying up to those currently in power as she continues to grow her economic empire and align herself with the world’s most powerful business leaders. While not a foregone conclusion, it’s all in the tea leaves. Let’s back up.\\n\\nEarlier this month, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted a cheery photo of himself on Instagram wearing a hoodie that read “Kim is my lawyer” with the caption “My only appropriate hoodie.” Kardashian commented with “Hahaha I love it!!!” before sharing the selfie on her Instagram Stories.\\n\\nIt still isn’t clear what inspired Zuckerberg’s shoutout. Did family momager Kris Jenner, who’s tagged in the caption, send Zuckerberg the hoodie? Was this some sort of poorly executed promotion for Kardashian’s upcoming Ryan Murphy legal drama All’s Fair? Will Kardashian, not actually a member of the bar, be representing Zuckerberg in his next lawsuit?\\n\\nJust a few years ago, the queen of selfies having a virtual giggle with a fellow billionaire like Zuckerberg wouldn’t have raised many eyebrows. However, Zuckerberg has spent the past year publicly ingratiating himself to President Donald Trump: altering Facebook’s speech policies in his favor, donating to his inauguration fund, and attending the ceremony in January.\\n\\nAlong with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Zuckerberg has been labeled a member of the “broligarchy,” a moniker for several tech billionaires trying to curry favor with the Trump administration with the hopes of influencing deregulation policies or attaining government power. Musk has already torn through the federal workforce with his Department of Government Efficiency.\\n\\nShe’s even broadcast her affinity for members of the Trump family. In addition to her well-documented friendship with Ivanka Trump, she shared a caption-less photo of first lady Melania Trump on her Instagram Stories the day of the inauguration. All these pointedly apolitical but public interactions with Trump’s family and associates have Kardashian’s followers wondering if she’s preparing to go all in on the president himself.\\n\\nIn contrast to Trump’s first term, it’s become more common to see popular celebrities interact with the Trump administration or, at the very least, withhold critical opinions. A slew of rappers, including the previously anti-Trump Snoop Dogg, performed at one of Trump’s inaguruation galas. When asked about Trump attending the Super Bowl this month, Kansas City Chiefs’ Travis Kelce had nothing but polite words to offer.\\n\\nNevertheless, the Calabasas influencers rose to power on the internet in the 2010s, around the same time that social movements like Black Lives Matter and Me Too were resounding online and demanding the engagement of celebrities. The family’s proximity to Black culture, whether through their romantic partners or their affinity for Black beauty trends, also put them in the position of being pressured to speak on racial issues and called out when they didn’t. Arguably, these were opinions we didn’t actually need to hear.\\n\\nNotably, she’s the only family member to fold social justice work into her brand, specifically around criminal justice reform. Beginning in 2018, she successfully advocated for the release of Alice Marie Johnson and Chris Young from prison. She also helped persuade the Trump administration to sign the First Step Act, aimed at changing sentencing laws and decreasing prison populations. Since then, she’s advocated for the clemency of multiple prisoners on death row and other incarcerated people, including the Menendez brothers.\\n\\nFrom left, Jared Kushner, Kim Kardashian, and Ivanka Trump at a 2019 White House event for criminal justice reform. Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nAs witnessed by her prison-reform efforts, she hasn’t been afraid to do direct business with Trump to advance her own causes. As much good as Kardashian may have done for the pardoned inmates, the clemency deal also just happened to redirect attention from her ex-husband’s comments about slavery and bring some goodwill to the Kardashian brand.\\n\\nThe world’s most famous business leaders are also making what feels like a unified move to the right — and being regarded as a serious player in the business world has long been a concern for Kardashian. On her Hulu reality show The Kardashians, she’s discussed her obsession with proving herself as a businessperson and her desire to be seen as a corporate disruptor on the level of a Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs.\\n\\nIn an episode of season 2, Kardashian says: “All of the big banks and VCs — everyone says, ‘Apple, Nike, Skims.’ We’re in that conversation, and it just makes me really proud.”\\n\\nFor a high-powered billionaire like Kardashian, it is perhaps only a matter of time before she kisses the ring, much the way her techier brethren have.\\n\\nIt’s not evident that Kardashian personally aligns with the views of MAGA. Her attendance at a Black business gala earlier this month suggests that she’s probably not in support of Trump’s sweeping anti-DEI agenda. Her own businesses have relied on the support and compliance of Black and nonwhite celebrities and models, who are often featured in her Skims and KKW beauty campaigns. Plus, it arguably still wouldn’t be the smartest move for a reality star trying to earn their stripes in Hollywood to start donning a red cap.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'is a senior correspondent and editor for Vox’s Future Perfect, covering global health. He has reported on health policy for more than 10 years, writing for Governing magazine, Talking Points Memo, and STAT before joining Vox in 2017.\\n\\nElon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) underlings are powering his takeover of the government with a “hardcore” work ethic that sacrifices sleeping for around-the-clock grinding.\\n\\nMusk boasted that they are working long hours, even over weekends because their “opponents” take that time off. They moved sofa beds into the Office of Personnel Management and other government agencies. One seller of trendy “sleep pods” generously sent their product to Musk and his team, hoping to help them catch some precious zzz’s.\\n\\nIt is an old-school Silicon Valley mentality, which values an absolute time commitment above everything else. The image of Musk hunkering down in a federal office building evokes the tales of him sleeping on the Tesla factory floor. The hustle culture of Silicon Valley is replete with these legends of company founders and their minions sleeping at their desks for days on end trying to crack an important problem on their way to glory. This is a culture that has sought for years to “hack” sleep — something they view as a woeful inefficiency — by, for example, the practice of breaking sleep into bite-sized portions throughout the day rather than one big chunk at night.\\n\\nSome House Republicans have suggested that Capitol Hill, the entire federal government, and the country in general have something to learn from this zealous work ethic. The pandemic-driven heyday of remote work is over; corporate executives across different industries are increasingly pushing workers to recommit to coming to the office and generally prioritizing work above all else, a more Muskian ethos.\\n\\nBut the fetishization of this hardcore, no-sleep mentality chafes against what the vast majority of research advises: We need more sleep — not less. The modern world makes it hard to get a good night’s rest. A lack of quality sleep affects not only our short-term cognitive and physical capabilities, but also the longer-term prognosis for deadly diseases like heart disease and cancer.\\n\\nThe medical research here is clear: We are not better off subsisting on five or six hours of sleep while we grind away — we need more.\\n\\nThe challenge is figuring out how to get those eight hours, no matter whether you are overhauling the federal bureaucracy or just trying to be your best self.\\n\\nWhy our brains need sleep\\n\\nThe modern eight-hour standard took shape in parallel to the Industrial Revolution, when more people started working clearly delineated schedules, i.e., the famous 9-to-5 shift. Electricity also became more common, untethering people from the sleep schedule that had been dictated by natural light. Medical professionals began to recognize the value of a long, consistent sleep.\\n\\nMore recent research has added some nuance, indicating that some people get enough rest from seven hours of sleep and others may need more like nine because of natural genetic differences. But the standard had been set. And that naturally left an emerging group of sleep scientists wondering what happened if people did not get enough rest.\\n\\nWilliam Dement started recording brain patterns during sleep in the 1950s, unlocking the approach that has allowed researchers to see the changes in brain activity that could explain why sleep and its absence had different effects. He attended an attempt to break the Guinness World Record for the most time spent without sleep in the early 1960s (it was for 11 days). As the head of the first professional medical society dedicated to sleep science, he oversaw foundational studies that evaluated sleep deprivation and the behavioral changes that it caused.\\n\\nDement helped to identify REM sleep patterns and their value, as well as sleep apnea, or periods of interrupted breathing that can disrupt sleep. He and other scientists began to document that people who were sleep deprived would slip into what later became called “microsleeps” — brief periods of unintentional sleeping that contribute to workplace accidents and errors.\\n\\nHere in the 21st century, researchers have discovered the biological mechanisms that could explain these effects. Studies have shown that lack of sleep causes reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex (which is responsible for decision-making) and the hippocampus (where our memories are stored).\\n\\nOne small study of novice software engineers found their coding suffered with less sleep. A physician who ran a mobile clinic for tech workers told Fortune that he had found many of his patients had biological ages decades beyond their actual age, which could be linked to the grind lifestyle.\\n\\nPeople who don’t get enough sleep are also worse at controlling their emotions, have worse moods, and are less capable of relating to others, according to research published over the past decade. Neurological exams have found that there is increased activity in the amygdala (which processes emotion) when people are sleep deprived.\\n\\nThe rest of your body also needs the rest. Medical researchers have linked heart disease to insufficient sleep. When I interviewed oncologists last year to hear their best hypotheses about why more young people are developing cancers, several of them cited lack of sleep as a risk factor that needed to be better understood. In general, we already know a lack of sleep makes our immune system less efficient.\\n\\nYou need your sleep!\\n\\nElon Musk himself acknowledged that those infamous sleep habits weren’t good for him and said he was trying to get more like six hours a night these days because his old routine gave him “brain pain.” Unfortunately, his reported use of drugs, including ketamine, which is associated with bad sleep, and his tweeting patterns give us reason to doubt he is suddenly getting more sleep. The grind continues, now in DC.\\n\\nFor a crew that boasts about their sleep schedules, it’s fair to wonder if that’s having an impact. DOGE’s 120-hour work week literally does not leave enough time for eight hours of sleep.\\n\\nWhether it’s incompetence, fatigue, or something more nefarious, other outlets have already reported sloppy operational security, the inadvertent disclosure of classified information, and the firing then quick rehiring of critical government staff who were working on issues as important as nuclear safety and the bird flu crisis. In one laughable case, DOGE claimed to have saved $8 billion for the American taxpayer when they had actually saved $8 million — all because of what should have been an easily caught mathematical error. The DOGE crew is seemingly stacking the deck for further risks to ensue. The latest? The Trump administration is laying off thousands of IRS workers right as tax season kicks into gear.\\n\\nBringing a bunch of sleep pods into the White House was, in a way, an admission that a long uninterrupted sleep cannot be hacked. Think of the name of the AI-powered sleep pod company — Eight Sleep — that provided $4,600 beds to Musk and his team. Eight hours of sleep is still the goal. Mark Zuckerberg and life hacker extraordinaire Bryan Johnson are also fans of those pods. Jeff Bezos, who has also nudged closer to this inner circle of Trump tech bros, has long advocated for good sleep as an important ingredient to success.\\n\\nIt’s telling that this culture that once thought it could take a shortcut around a full night’s sleep is evolving instead to simply try to achieve those eight hours as efficiently as possible. And these pods have also, I should note, received a rave review from my colleagues at the Verge: “Smart sleep is worth the cost.” Because sleep is really that valuable.\\n\\nIt’s harder than ever now to get those eight hours on our own, which is the problem the pods are trying to solve. The light pollution from our devices makes us sleep worse; that artificial light disrupts our circadian rhythms. The doomscrolling we tend to do on those devices is also bad for our sleep. What a surprise.\\n\\nThat is not to say we all need to buy a $4,600 bed, though. There are simpler steps you can take to achieve a better night’s rest. Develop a set routine — which should include putting your device away well before you try to close your eyes. Don’t eat or drink too much before bed and definitely avoid any stimulants. We’ve even got tips on buying a mattress here at Vox. And recently, Jonquilyn Hill spoke with Jade Wu, a sleep psychologist, on the Explain It to Me podcast. Wu emphasized in particular committing to a set routine as being important to getting quality sleep and, in the morning, trying to expose yourself to lots of light to start your circadian clock.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'is a news editor with Vox’s politics and policy team. He’s helped cover elections, Congress, and both the Biden and Trump administrations. Previously, Sean was Vox’s weekend editor.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump waits outside of the West Wing before welcoming King Abdullah II of Jordan to the White House in Washington, DC, on February 11, 2025. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nThe spate of federal firings that stretched throughout last week escalated last Friday, and continued through the holiday weekend.\\n\\nNearly all of those fired were “probationary” employees, a status usually conferred on new workers, those that switch agencies, and the recently promoted, that provides fewer protections against removal.\\n\\nReports have been unclear about exactly how many people were fired and where. However, we do know some details:\\n\\nThe Trump administration has argued these cuts (and more) are needed to slash federal spending, and to shrink a bloated bureaucracy.\\n\\nHowever, the latest reduction in force is unlikely to provide taxpayers with major savings, and could jeopardize the government’s mandate to protect its citizens.\\n\\nTake, for instance, the VA’s claim that its terminations will save $98 million per year. That is a lot of money to me, but it represents only 0.00145 percent of the $6.75 trillion the federal government spent in the 2024 fiscal year. Celebrating that cut is like me jumping for joy because I managed to save a tenth of a penny by foregoing something at the grocery store. Sure it’s money saved, but not really an appreciable sum.\\n\\nThe point is — and it’s a point others have made — the US will need to make massive cuts, on the trillion, not million, dollar scale if it really wants to appreciably tighten its belt. To do that, it would need to slash spending on expensive programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and the defense.\\n\\nNow to the other claim: that the government is too big.\\n\\nMuch like with the VA’s savings, those let go represent a fraction of the federal workforce. If you combine the latest round of layoffs with previous rounds — and even with the roughly 75,000 people who took the government’s buyout offer — then just under 4 percent of the government’s 2.4 million person workforce has been cut.\\n\\nThat means the government is still pretty big. The good news about that is it means government services are unlikely to keel over tomorrow. The worry is about the day after tomorrow.\\n\\nWe’re not out of fire season, and fire experts and Forest Service workers are expressing great concern that they won’t have the manpower to keep communities safe.\\n\\n“It’s just going to be a disaster for the wildfire response this season,” one Forest Service firefighter told Stateline.\\n\\nSpring break and summer travel season are coming in fast too. The FAA was clear that it didn’t fire any air traffic controllers, but, as you read in this newsletter a few weeks ago, aviation experts believe our flight systems are seriously overtaxed.\\n\\n“Right now, flight operations are like a rubber band,” the University of North Dakota’s Daniel Adjekum told me recently. “And we keep pulling it.”\\n\\nAnd it’s not just a matter of fire or flying: a disaster could happen at any time requiring FEMA’s full attention; the CDC might need to be called into action over a new pandemic — federal agencies were already struggling to get bird flu under control.\\n\\nIt’s impossible to tell you right now what the effects of these cuts will be, and if things will go as badly as some now claim. But the worry is, if things do go south due to lack of personnel, it will be too late — avoidable tragedy will have struck.'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-24T11:45:00',\n",
       "   'content': 'is a senior correspondent at Vox. He covers a wide range of political and policy issues with a special focus on questions that internally divide the American left and right. Before coming to Vox in 2024, he wrote a column on politics and economics for New York Magazine.\\n\\nElon Musk might be the most powerful man in America.\\n\\nDonald Trump has put his patron in charge of the federal bureaucracy, allowing Musk to tailor the administrative state to his whims, which are far-reaching and almost certainly unconstitutional. The tech mogul has shuttered a government agency in defiance of Congress’s will, orchestrated mass layoffs at myriad other bureaus, and threatened to cancel payments that he deems illegitimate.\\n\\nMusk lacks Trump’s official powers, of course. But his vast wealth — and the primary challengers it could fund — strikes fear into the hearts of Republican lawmakers, and threatens to upend key state-level elections. Meanwhile, through his control of X, Musk is driving news cycles in nations the world-over.\\n\\nAll this invites the question: What motivates Musk’s pursuit of personal power, and his apparent contempt for constitutional constraints upon it?\\n\\nOn some level, this query is unanswerable (no one can know with certainty what motivates Musk, not even Musk). On another, the answer may seem straightforward (Musk is not shy about broadcasting his grandiose ambitions to colonize Mars, save America from the “woke mind virus” etc.).\\n\\nBut as I’ve been forced to contemplate Musk’s worldview in recent weeks, I’ve found myself thinking a lot about another man who despised social justice movements, evinced disdain for liberal democracy, and dreamed of reorganizing government with a cabal of likeminded, tech-savvy elites: Joshua N. Haldeman, a prominent 20th-century chiropractor, aviator, politician, conspiracy theorist and anti-Semite — who was also Musk’s maternal grandfather.\\n\\nHaldeman’s belief system shifted markedly over the course of his life. But throughout his political evolution, he gravitated toward a few core premises — a set of hateful and anti-democratic ideas that bear a striking (and disconcerting) resemblance to those of his grandson.\\n\\nIn saying this, I do not mean to assert that Musk’s views are identical to Haldeman’s, nor even that the billionaire’s ideology was necessarily influenced by that of his grandfather. Such influence is conceivable: Although Haldeman died when Musk was a child, he has spoken reverentially of his grandfather and was close with his maternal grandmother, Winnifred Haldeman. And Musk’s father has suggested that she shared some of her husband’s extremist views. This said, there’s no direct evidence that Musk ever took an interest in his grandfather’s politics.\\n\\nNevertheless, I think the similarities between Musk’s political ideas and his grandfather’s are worth noting, if only because they illustrate the timeless appeal — an enduring dangers — of their peculiar brand of conspiratorial elitism.\\n\\nMusk’s grandfather once wanted to replace democratic government with a benevolent dictatorship of engineers\\n\\nToward the tail end of the Great Depression, Haldeman joined a radical — and radically strange — political movement called Technocracy Incorporated.\\n\\nThe brainchild of the eminent engineer Howard Scott, Technocracy Incorporated argued that both democracy and market capitalism has grown obsolete. As the group explained in its 1939 pamphlet, “Technocracy in Plain Terms,” a citizen’s vote “has positively no effect on the actual operation of the country, for the country is not run by politicians anyway.” Yet in the name of this fraudulent democracy, society was allowing incompetent politicians to grossly mismanage the economy.\\n\\nMeanwhile, capitalism had been rendered inoperative by its own development. Technology was rapidly condemning workers to permanent unemployment — and rendering businesses unprofitable — by exponentially increasing productivity and output. At one point, Scott warned that “computers” were soon “going to do away with your accountants and your engineers, and it is also going to do away with your executives, as well as the blue collar and the white collar.”\\n\\nNeither the electorate nor the price system was fit to govern economic life in this new world. Together, they were propelling humanity toward catastrophe.\\n\\nAnd yet, the Technocrats argued, if we simply entrusted governance to a small group of tech-savvy elites — led by “the Great Engineer” — the people of North America could immediately know untold abundance, while working only part-time and retiring by age 46.\\n\\nScott’s organization married this utopian economic vision to bizarre internal aesthetics and practices, reminiscent of both futuristic fiction and contemporary fascism. Members of Technocracy Incorporated wore identical gray uniforms, drove gray cars, and saluted each other as though fellow soldiers. They also referred to one another by number instead of name (one went by “1x1809x56”).\\n\\nHaldeman, a man of science fascinated by novel technologies, took to Technocracy enthusiastically, adopting the moniker “10450-1,” and quickly becoming the leader of the organization’s Canadian branch (Musk’s decision to name one of his children “X Æ A-12” is reminiscent of Technocracy’s practices). In 1940, he warned his fellow technocrats that the “smashup” of society was imminent and that all must prepare for the “New Social Order.”\\n\\nAs World War II drew to a close, however, Haldeman abandoned Technocracy for a similar but distinct — and decidedly more hateful — political party.\\n\\nIn the 1940s, Haldeman embraced a more anti-Semitic brand of technocracy\\n\\nThe Social Credit Party shared many of Technocracy Incorporated’s defining characteristics. Both were founded by engineers who wished to revolutionize government amid the ravages of the Great Depression. Both argued that technological progress had made shared prosperity possible, if only experts were given more sovereignty over the economy. And both contended that representative democracy was hopelessly corrupt and dysfunctional.\\n\\nIn the estimation of Social Credit’s founder, C.H. Douglas, voters weren’t competent to make judgments about economic policy, and so authority over such matters needed to be transferred to the experts who actually ran productive enterprises, whether government agencies or private businesses. Elected officials would hold these experts accountable for delivering results, but only after giving them free reign to maximize output as they saw fit.\\n\\nThis made Social Credit’s brand of expert-rule a bit less authoritarian than Technocracy Incorporated’s. Yet the former party’s indictment of conventional democracy was markedly more fascistic.\\n\\nTo Social Credit, the problem with traditional republican government wasn’t merely that voters lacked elite engineers and managers’ tech savvy and expertise, but rather, that the public’s ignorance enabled “international Jewish finance” to dominate government through its control of the bureaucracy. “The Jew has no native culture and always aims at power without responsibility,” Douglas explained in Social Credit’s magazine in 1939. “He is the parasite upon, and corrupter of, every civilisation in which he has attained power.” Only Social Credit’s novel system of government could save Christian civilization from the Jewish bankers’ plot and deliver economic utopia.\\n\\nFor Musk’s grandfather, Social Credit’s virulent anti-Semitism seems to have been a feature not a bug. Haldeman became the head of Saskatchewan’s Social Credit Party in 1945, and ascended to its national chair a year later.\\n\\nIn 1946, the party’s Quebec branch received widespread criticism for publishing excerpts of “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,” a forged document purporting to detail a Jewish conspiracy for world domination. As Joshua Benton reported in The Atlantic, Haldeman swiftly rallied to his party’s defense. In a series of letters to a Saskatchewan newspaper, Musk’s grandfather argued that whether The Protocols were a forgery was beside the point since “the plan as outlined in these protocols has been rapidly unfolding in the period of observation of this generation.”\\n\\nHaldeman ran for both provincial and federal offices under the Social Credit banner and lost every election in a landslide. By 1949, he resigned from the party’s leadership. Within a year, he would fall in love with a different utopian political project, one that had just managed to actually secure state power — South African apartheid.\\n\\nHow Elon Musk’s Canadian grandfather fell in love with South African white supremacy\\n\\nIn 1949, Haldeman had a conversation with an Anglican minister in Toronto that would change the course of his life. In Haldeman’s own account, that holy man persuaded him that South Africa would “become the leader of white civilization in the World.”\\n\\nMusk’s grandfather evidently decided that he wished to be a part of that glorious project.\\n\\nHaldeman moved his family to Pretoria in 1950, the same year that South Africa’s government required all residents to register their race with the state and segregated urban housing. Shortly thereafter, in a letter to a Canadian newspaper, Haldeman made his enthusiasm for apartheid plain. He wrote that Black South Africans were “quite clever in a routine job, but the best of them cannot assume responsibility and will abuse authority,” and “The present government of South Africa knows how to handle the native question. They are endeavoring to make the natives as independent and self-supporting as possible.” In Haldeman’s assessment, “talk of a native uprising in Africa is purely Communist wishful thinking.”\\n\\nA decade later, in the face of just such an uprising, Haldeman’s defense of apartheid grew more conspiratorial. In response to growing international condemnation of the apartheid regime, he penned a short tract entitled, The International Conspiracy to Establish a World Dictatorship and the Menace to South Africa. As the New Yorker’s Jill Lepore has documented, that booklet read in part, “Every day the brain-washers repeat and emphasize the things they want us to believe. As examples ‘The Natives are ill-treated,’ ‘underpaid,’ ‘underprivileged,’ ‘separate development is wrong,’ ‘apartheid is un-Christian.”\\n\\nFor Haldeman, the brainwashers consisted of a cabal of Jewish bankers, intellectuals, and philanthropies, which were puppet-mastering the uprisings in South Africa and plotting “an outside invasion by hordes of Coloured people.”\\n\\nAbsent the agitations of this “international conspiracy,” Black South Africans would be well-reconciled to apartheid, Haldeman argued, because they had heretofore recognized that the white minority was more competent at managing the economy and facilitating innovation. “The facts of history show that the White man has always developed the country he inhabits to the benefit of all concerned,” he wrote, while the “Black people of Africa have been in close contact with civilization from the earliest times but, on their own, built nothing and discovered nothing, not even the wheel.”\\n\\nHow Elon Musk’s political ideas resemble his grandfather’s\\n\\nHaldeman’s politics clearly evolved over time. But there are a few core premises that Technocracy Incorporated, The Social Credit Party, and his brand of pro-Apartheid evangelism held in common. All three:\\n\\ndeemed conventional democracy hopelessly corrupt and defective (Social Credit and Haldeman’s pro-apartheid tracts both attributed democracy’s woes specifically to the ignorance of the masses and malevolence of the Jewish financers who manipulated them);\\n\\ninsisted that power should be concentrated in the hands of an intellectually superior minority (master engineers, scientific experts, and businessmen in the case of Technocracy and Social Credit, white South Africans in the case of Apartheid evangelists), on the grounds that this elite was best qualified to deliver economic progress;\\n\\nand believed that the stakes of allowing this elite to rule were extraordinarily high: If governance were entrusted to conventional democracy, then either economic ruin (in the vision of Technocracy Incorporated and Social Credit) or the collapse of “white Christian civilization” and establishment of a “world dictatorship” (in the view of Haldeman’s pro-apartheid tract) would follow. By contrast, in all three belief systems, the sustained leadership of the intellectual elite promised to deliver awe-inspiring economic progress, if not utopia.\\n\\nI believe that Musk’s recent words and deeds reflect all three of these thought patterns.\\n\\nTo be sure, now that Musk has assumed extraordinary authority over government through the electoral process, he regularly proclaims his commitment to democracy. But before the 2024 election’s outcome was certain, he repeatedly suggested that the machinations of Jewish financiers — and the mass immigration of credulous “illegals” — were on the cusp of rendering American democracy irrevocably corrupt and dysfunctional.\\n\\n“The Dems have imported massive numbers of illegals to swing states,” Musk posted on X in October. “Their STATED plan is to give them citizenship as soon as possible, turning all swing states Dem. America would then become a one-party, deep blue socialist state.”\\n\\nIn other remarks, Musk has described the conspiracy against America in terms evocative of his grandfather’s warnings about the plot against South Africa. In November 2023, an X user lamented that “Jewish communities” had been pushing “hatred against whites,” and flooding Western countries with “hordes of minorities.” Musk replied, “You have said the actual truth.”\\n\\nMusk proceeded to justify this claim by asking, “Does the public realize that Soros wants open borders?” an apparent reference to the far-right conspiracy theory that Soros seeks to “replace” America’s white majority with masses of easily manipulated nonwhite immigrants.\\n\\nIt seems clear then that Musk’s anxieties about democracy’s vulnerabilities to conniving financiers and credulous, nonwhite hordes resemble those of his grandfather.\\n\\nWhether he shares the younger Haldeman’s enthusiasm for technocracy is less obvious. Certainly, in his present role, Musk portrays himself as fighting to take power away from the administrative elite, and return it to the people.\\n\\nYet in actual practice, Musk has claimed for himself and his small-team of expert coders the authority to override or subvert laws duly passed by the people’s representatives. Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has sought to fire civil servants, block spending, dissolve government agencies, and bribe federal workers into resigning, all in defiance of Congress’s will.\\n\\nFurther, Musk’s downsizing of federal agencies threatens to transfer power away from a democratically accountable government and toward private sector firms run by tech-savvy elites, on an autocratic basis. After the Federal Aviation Administration laid off workers responsible for air safety this month, the government announced that Musk’s SpaceX rocket company would be helping the administration “envision” a new and improved air traffic control system.\\n\\nAnd Musk is emphatic that increasing the authority of both DOGE and his personal companies would bring extraordinary technological progress — while limiting the power of his genius engineers, or allowing his political opponents to win democratic elections would mean national bankruptcy and the end of civilization, if not of humanity itself. As Musk put the point in September, “The Department of Government Efficiency is the only path to extending life beyond Earth.”\\n\\nIt is not hard to get from these premises to the conclusion that ensuring the power of Musk and similarly brilliant elites is more important than democracy or the rule of law. Judging by Musk’s actions, he may have already reached that determination.\\n\\nMusk’s ideas aren’t the same as his grandfather’s, but they present similar dangers\\n\\nNone of this is to say that Musk shares all of his grandfather’s beliefs. For all of his outbursts and illiberal actions, he has never forthrightly endorsed white supremacy or authoritarian rule, as Haldeman did.\\n\\nOne reason for doubting that Musk inherited his penchant for right-wing authoritarianism is that he came by his extremism only recently. A decade ago, Musk was, by his own account, a moderate Democrat. It’s plausible that, like so many other Americans, he was simply radicalized by the combination of Covid, culture wars, and social media addiction.\\n\\nYet the overlap between Musk’s current outlook and his grandfather’s is notable, even if the latter did not shape the former. Either way, the similarities indicate that, across generations, a certain kind of man —- intellectually gifted, tech-savvy, and maniacally ambitious — can be vulnerable to hateful and authoritarian ideas.\\n\\nDemocracy’s flaws are real. And it is easy for self-assured, technically proficient elites to look at those flaws — and then at humanity’s unrealized technological potential — and conclude that their society could achieve utopia, if only people like themselves were liberated from the tyranny of the credulous masses (and the bad elites who manipulate them).\\n\\nBut Haldeman’s example illustrates the folly of such thinking. In reality, elites who seek authoritarian power are rarely as competent as they claim, or believe themselves to be. Scott, the genius engineer who wished to bring Technocracy to America, was in actuality not a brilliant scientist, so much as a serial fabulist. Douglas, the founder of Social Credit, also seems to have fabricated his sterling professional credentials. Meanwhile, the apartheid government’s claim that it governed in the interests of all residents — and that Black South Africans welcomed their subjugation — is now almost universally recognized as an abominable lie.\\n\\nMusk is doubtlessly a gifted business executive. But his purported expertise about the federal bureaucracy, and how to increase its efficiency, is utterly fraudulent. And the hazards of concentrating power in the hands of an arrogant pseudo-expert are increasingly apparent; in recent days, DOGE has accidentally fired (and then hastily attempted to rehire) workers responsible for ensuring the safety of America’s skies, nuclear weapons, and food.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'is a senior reporter for Vox’s Future Perfect and co-host of the Future Perfect podcast. She writes primarily about the future of consciousness, tracking advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience and their staggering ethical implications. Before joining Vox, Sigal was the religion editor at the Atlantic.\\n\\nYour Mileage May Vary is an advice column offering you a new framework for thinking through your ethical dilemmas and philosophical questions. This unconventional column is based on value pluralism — the idea that each of us has multiple values that are equally valid but that often conflict with each other. Here is a Vox reader’s question, condensed and edited for clarity.\\n\\nI grew up with a mother who was very frequently angry and completely willing to show it in tone of voice and facial expression, with no concern for others’ emotional needs. My dad was the opposite — rarely angry, easygoing, affectionate, fun. As a child I argued with my mom a lot, but when I was about 13 I made up my mind that I did not want to be an angry person like her. I wanted to be like my dad. With the help of religion, I did a lot of introspection and learned a level of anger self-control that I didn’t previously have.\\n\\nHowever, all my life I’ve occasionally “lost it,” reverting to the early patterns I learned from my mom rather than the later patterns I copied from my dad. On such occasions, which happen about once a year when I’ve found someone’s behavior outrageous, I end up feeling really guilty afterward. I feel that I have polluted the world with my outburst, my willingness to give in to reactivity. This guilt goes on for a while, and then, after I’ve apologized for the intensity of my reaction and the person I yelled at and I have discussed the aggravating situation more rationally, I feel a little better. But not completely better.\\n\\nI told a good friend about all this, and he suggested that I could address the painful lingering guilt by meditating a little while. I appreciate meditation, but I wonder if it’s a bad idea to meditate away or shrug off the feeling of guilt. It seems risky to the goal of being a moral person to get in the habit of transcending guilt. And yet … guilt clearly can get all out of proportion at times. With both anger and guilt, how can we tell when these emotions are justified and useful, and when they’re excessive and unnecessary?\\n\\nDear Angry at Anger,\\n\\nAround 2,500 years ago, the Ancient Greeks put on an amazing play that gets at the heart of your question. I’m talking about The Eumenides by the playwright Aeschylus, and I’m going to tell you its story because I think it can help you.\\n\\nIn the play, the goddess Athena swoops into Athens to see what’s got everyone so riled up. Turns out there’s been a murder, and the Furies — walking, frothing embodiments of anger in Ancient Greek mythology — want to exact revenge. They argue that it’s necessary: If we don’t stick up for people who’ve been wronged, wrongdoers will feel emboldened to keep harming others. But Athena thinks blood vengeance is no way to run a civilization.\\n\\nSo the goddess initiates two transformations. First, she replaces the Furies with a court of law to judge the defendant fair and square. But, recognizing that the powerful Furies can’t just be dismissed, she offers them a place to live beneath the city, where they’ll be revered by the citizens as long as they accept the constraints of the law. In other words, anger is not to be banished — only contained.\\n\\nBut this deal doesn’t fully satisfy the Furies: They feel dishonored, like animals in a cage. So in the second transformation, Athena does something radical: She honors them. “You’re holy, honored here, and you’re my guest,” she says. And she invites them to stop identifying with anger and start identifying with kindness instead. In fact, she asks them to bless all the Athenians. They like this idea of themselves as noble benefactors, so they willingly change their identity — and even their name. They go from “the Furies” to “the Eumenides,” which means “the kindly ones.”\\n\\nHave a question you want me to answer in the next Your Mileage May Vary column? Feel free to email me at sigal.samuel@vox.com or fill out this anonymous form! Newsletter subscribers will get my column before anyone else does and their questions will be prioritized for future editions. Sign up here!\\n\\nSo why do I think this play can be helpful to you? For one thing, it reminds us that anger is an innocent emotion: It’s just trying to help us. It’s an indicator that something is off and needs to be dealt with. Remember, the Furies’ initial goal was to stick up for people who’ve been hurt and stave off the threat of more hurt. That’s a good goal! The problem is not the anger itself — it’s a certain behavioral response to the anger that needs reform.\\n\\nFor the Furies, and for lots of us humans, the behavioral response is often to seek revenge or lash out. That’s why a long line of Western philosophers — from Seneca in the first century to Martha Nussbaum in the 21st — argued that anger is pretty much always irrational and destructive. But as women of color scholars like Audre Lorde and Myisha Cherry have pointed out, the behavioral response to anger doesn’t have to be destructive all the time. It can be constructive. This “Lordean rage,” as Cherry calls it, doesn’t seek liberation for an oppressed group by trying to beat down the oppressor; instead, it tries to bring everyone onto equal footing, insisting that no one is free until everyone is free.\\n\\nYour mom, from the sounds of it, had a behavioral response to anger that was destructive. She wasn’t bad for feeling anger, but it was deeply unfortunate that she expressed it the way she did. You’re right to want to try to avoid expressing anger in that same way.\\n\\nAnd this is where meditation can actually be helpful: not after an angry outburst, as your friend suggested, but before it.\\n\\nOver time, mindfulness meditation can train you to notice an emotion as it’s arising — and get curious about it. If you feel rage rising within you, but you can tell it’s the constructive Lordean rage, use it to motivate action. But (and this is much more often the case, at least for me) if you hear a certain story forming in your mind — “He’s wrong, I’m right! I’ll put him in his place!” — that’s probably the destructive kind, and it might be better to give yourself an adult time-out by saying, “I need a little time to process this. Let me get back to you later.”\\n\\nIt sounds like you’ve already practiced this to some degree, and you usually manage to apply it in the moment, which is awesome. You’ve achieved Athena’s first transformation — the one where she respectfully offered the Furies a home, while insisting that they live within certain constraints.\\n\\nBut. But, but, but. You’re human, my dear, so I can pretty much guarantee that you won’t manage to achieve this every time. There will be the occasional outburst. So the real question is, how can you handle that without stewing in endless guilt?\\n\\nYou wrote, “It seems risky to the goal of being a moral person to get in the habit of transcending guilt.” But it’s also morally risky to stay in guilt mode: That doesn’t actually help anyone, and it can just keep your attention resignedly centered on yourself.\\n\\nInstead, guilt — like anger — is meant to be a useful indicator. It’s there to tell you when you’ve acted out of line with your values. But like other indicators in our lives (think: the smoke alarm), it’s counterproductive or even harmful to just sit with it too long. The point is to change your behavior: Make amends! Run out of the burning house!\\n\\nI suspect guilt about angry outbursts is sticky for you, though, because of the family mythology you developed growing up. At age 13 — an age when we can’t easily differentiate between the emotion of anger itself (innocent) and a particular expression of it (problematic) — you came to the conclusion that you didn’t want to be like your mom. That’s super understandable. It’s common for us to develop family mythologies where we talk about ourselves or our siblings as being “like mom” or “like dad.” But those mythologies can inadvertently do us a major disservice. I’d encourage you to revisit yours now, as an adult.\\n\\nYou specify that to you, being “like mom” means being “an angry person.” But is there such a thing? The truth is, all humans get angry. In fact, all mammals experience reactive aggression; it’s part of the mammalian response to a perceived threat or stressor — the “fight” part of the “fight or flight” response. From the point of view of the nervous system, there’s no “justified” versus “unjustified” anger; a threat is perceived, so anger arises. While some people may have less impulse control or be less skilled at managing their behavioral response to anger, these things are on a spectrum and they’re alterable. Anger is not a person’s fixed essence.\\n\\nA cornerstone of Buddhism — the idea of anatta — is instructive here. Anatta means that a person has no permanent fixed essence. There is no static “me.” My self is always changing because it’s subject to different causes and conditions in the environment: whether my family says encouraging or hurtful things to me, whether I experience a traumatizing war or live in peacetime, whether I have enough nutrition or not, and so on. Same for your mom, and same for you.\\n\\nIf we look at anger through this lens, we see it not as some irrational madness that suddenly takes possession of an individual (à la Seneca and other Western philosophers), but as a response to the conditions in the person’s life. Maybe they’ve endured trauma and, as an adaptive response, they developed a hair-trigger reaction to any perceived threat, making them quick to anger. Maybe they were exposed to aggression at a young age and that diminished their brain’s capacity for impulse control. Maybe they haven’t had an opportunity to learn more skillful ways of expressing their feelings.\\n\\nViewing anger this way, we naturally feel an upswelling of compassion. That’s not to say we excuse the behavior, but we understand a bit more where it’s coming from, so we’re less likely to demonize the other person or be angry at them in turn.\\n\\nThe beauty of this is that we’re also less likely to demonize ourselves when we have an angry outburst. We know that we, like all other humans, get angry because we’re humans and we have certain conditions acting upon us. That doesn’t mean we get to be complacent and give free rein to anger when it arises. But it means that we don’t stew in guilt, or in fear of being “an angry person.” If anything, we stew in compassion.\\n\\nAnd this, to me, is Athena’s second transformation. It’s the realization that we can actually use anger as a doorway to a really radical compassion, turning “furies” into “kindly ones.”\\n\\nBy all means, keep practicing the first transformation — the mindful constraining of how you behaviorally express anger. But in those inevitable moments when you slip up and get reactive, can you recognize that as evidence that you’re a human animal who is affected by her inner and outer environment? Smile compassionately at your anger and say: Yep, still human!\\n\\nBonus: What I’m reading\\n\\nIf only every philosopher wrote as clearly as Agnes Callard! This week’s question prompted me to read her short piece “ Angry Forever ,” in which she argues that being angry, and even staying angry, is actually very rational.\\n\\nSpeaking of Callard, she’s got a new book out called Open Socrates Writing about it for the New Yorker , Joshua Rothman notes that the internet gives us the illusion of free speech and real thought, but it’s just that — an illusion. Everyone can publish their contrarian opinions, but, as Callard writes, “free speech is achieved neither by debate nor by persuasion” — it’s achieved when you can discuss your deep questions with someone you consider your equal, someone who is listening to you sincerely and willing to have their own opinion changed in the process.\\n\\nI recently read the philosopher Susan Wolf’s essay “ The Moral of Moral Luck .” She describes what she calls “the nameless virtue” — a virtue that involves recognizing that none of us is a separate and independent self: “we are beings who are thoroughly in-the-world, in interaction with others whose movements and thoughts we cannot fully control, and whom we affect and are affected by accidentally as well as intentionally, involuntarily, unwittingly, inescapably, as well as voluntarily and deliberately.” Though it might be nameless in Western philosophy, I think this virtue does actually have a name: It’s the Buddhists’ anatta!\\n\\nThis story was originally published in The Highlight, Vox’s member-exclusive magazine.

       "   'content': 'The main coalition of advocacy groups that have helped resettle Afghans who aided American forces during the war is ramping up its pressure campaign on President Donald Trump to reverse course after he closed the door on an estimated 200,000 people.\\n\\nThe coalition of more than 250 groups, known as #AfghanEvac, is calling on veterans of the global war on terror to rally against the Trump administration for blocking the relocation of Afghans in danger of retaliation from the Taliban for working with the U.S. government.\\n\\n“This is worse than the chaotic withdrawal in August 2021. Because now, we know better. Because this time, it is not an accident,” Shawn VanDiver, a Navy veteran and founder of #AfghanEvac, wrote in an open letter to veterans Monday. “It is not an oversight. It is a choice. It is an intentional betrayal of those we swore to stand with and an insult to the veterans who led this fight.”\\n\\nWithin hours of taking office, Trump issued an executive action that indefinitely halted all refugee admissions and foreign aid, including cancelling flights for Afghans who were already vetted and who had booked flights to come to the U.S. Trump’s actions effectively denied nearly all pathways forward for Afghans who helped the U.S. military over the course of the 20-year war.\\n\\nThe letter, provided first to PBS News, calls on veterans to speak up and call their representatives in a push to convince the Trump administration to reverse course. VanDiver also placed blame on some of Trump’s top advisers.\\n\\nRead the full letter.\\n\\n“We believe this decision comes directly from the White House, specifically from Homeland Security Advisor and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller. We don’t know if Secretary [of State Marco] Rubio, or even President Trump himself, are aware of the implications of this shut down,” VanDiver writes. “We are certain that National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, does not support this action, because he has vocally and publicly worked for the last several years to ensure an immigration pathway is available for the Afghans he served alongside.”\\n\\nWaltz, a green beret who served two combat tours in Afghanistan, has staunchly supported resettling Afghans to the U.S., warning often that the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan after the withdrawal put the lives of Afghan allies at risk. Miller, one of Trump’s longtime advisers, fervently supported dismantling the country’s refugee system during the campaign — one of the legal pathways available to immigrants — even as Trump attacked President Joe Biden over the Afghanistan pullout.\\n\\nThe White House and the National Security Council did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nIncluded in the 200,000 Afghans estimated eligible for resettlement as refugees or through a special immigration visa are 3,000 family members of active-duty U.S. military. And tens of thousands of Afghans who were ready to travel to the U.S. have been stranded in Kabul and Pakistan.\\n\\n“It’s hard for my brain, or our brains, to understand that he would be such a hypocrite.”\\n\\nPressed on why he thinks Trump himself is unaware of the actions of his own administration officials, VanDiver said, “Because it’s hard for my brain, or our brains, to understand that he would be such a hypocrite.”\\n\\n“It’s too hard for my brain to comprehend that he would know that this was happening and just leave these people behind,” VanDiver added in a phone call with PBS News.\\n\\nThe pressure campaign comes as Trump’s administration is now drafting plans to completely shut down the State Department office that oversees the resettlement of Afghans to the U.S., known as the Office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts, or CARE. The move would mean a complete end to official efforts to protect and relocate Afghans who aided or worked directly for the U.S. government and their relatives.\\n\\nThe relocation office, created in the aftermath of the chaotic 2021 pullout under the Biden administration, was recently funded for another three years by Congress. Then-Rep. Waltz, now Trump’s national security adviser, and then-Sen. Rubio, now Trump’s Secretary of State, voted for that funding in December.\\n\\n“You may hear, ‘We don’t know who these people are.’ That is a lie,” the letter states. “You may hear, “This is just a temporary pause.” That is a lie. Trump’s State Department is making permanent plans to dismantle the relocation infrastructure that we built, brick-by-brick, through sheer grit and unwavering force of will.”\\n\\nA State Department spokesperson acknowledged the administration is considering the future of the Office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts, but said no decisions have been made at this time. They added that the program continues to provide support to Afghan allies currently at overseas processing locations.\\n\\nThe State Department spokesperson did not respond to questions about AfghanEvac’s push for the administration to reverse its decision.\\n\\nProcessing of special immigrant visas for the thousands of Afghans stuck in Qatar or Albania means nothing, VanDiver said, if all funding and flights are cancelled. To date, some 200,000 Afghans have resettled in America since 2021.\\n\\nThe State Department is expected to review a plan this week that would shutter the program entirely by April — potentially leaving 200,000 Afghans stranded and some separated from their loved ones.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'They’re all living out their Newsmax fantasies, and the rest of us are just along for the ride. The acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia is a guy named Ed Martin, a pure Trumper down to his viscera. Martin first made news as the organizer of the “Stop the Steal” rally that ended up in an insurrection on January 6, 2021. He went on to defend the insurrectionists in court. Now, rewarded for those efforts by the president whose rhetoric inspired the violence, Martin has the power to act out his Xwitter fantasies on real people in the real world. From Reuters:\\n\\nInterim U.S. Attorney Ed Martin said in an email seen by Reuters that the probe was inspired by a conversation with an employee of billionaire Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE—an entity created by Republican President Donald Trump. DOGE has triggered a wave of layoffs across the federal government. “Late last night I took a call from a senior DOGE staffer. We spoke about some pressing tech issues and then he told me about threats against DOGE workers. It is despicable that these men and women are being threatened,” Martin said in the email.\\n\\nDeath threats are bad. Don’t make death threats. Don’t be like Ed Martin’s client base.\\n\\nThis assumes that a) Martin is telling the truth, and that b) the DOGEling is telling Ed Martin the truth. However, stand back and watch U.S. Attorney Martin go off the diving board completely.\\n\\nMartin named the initiative “Operation Whirlwind,” saying that Schumer, the top Democrat in the Republican-led U.S. Senate, is the subject of a threats investigation. Schumer spoke out against Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh at a 2020 abortion-rights rally by saying: “You have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price.” “I reached out to Senator Schumer to investigate his threats,” Martin said. “He has not yet responded to me.”\\n\\nAttorney Ed is now saying that Schumer may be guilty of using a metaphor publicly that resulted almost five years later in a death threat against an anonymous staffer who may well have been desperately trolling for a prom date when Schumer said what he said. This is completely bananas.\\n\\nSchumer’s comments have become a conjuring spell on the Right. It is used to summon the dark spirit of Both Sides whenever anyone points out that El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago incited sedition on January 6. (Brief Historical Aside: No police died or were injured by Chuck Schumer’s remarks.) And Attorney Ed is nothing if not a loyal acolyte of the Compendium of Wingnut Magic.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, the top prosecutor in Martin’s office overseeing criminal cases resigned after she said Martin pressured her to investigate a contract awarded during President Joe Biden’s tenure and freeze the assets of the contract’s recipient, even though there was not enough evidence to do so. In his email on Wednesday, Martin said that his office has been “flooded with threats against those who helped free the January 6 prisoners.” However, Martin failed to mention the threats that federal prosecutors, FBI agents and judges are continuing to receive online from January 6 defendants after Trump granted them clemency on his first day back in office.\\n\\nYes, funny, that.'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-19T18:36:00',\n",
       "   'content': '(Optional Musical Accompaniment to This Post)\\n\\nLate Tuesday, the president signed yet another executive order. This one was the equivalent of Napoleon, his new historical BFF, putting the crown on his own head in Notre-Dame de Paris in 1804. Except Napoleon had the actual power to do it, while El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago is relying on smoke, mirrors, and the cowardice of other people. From Politico:\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday signed a sweeping executive order bringing independent agencies under the control of the White House—an action that would greatly expand his power but is likely to attract significant legal challenges. It represents Trump’s latest attempt to consolidate power beyond boundaries other presidents have observed and to test the so-called unitary executive theory, which states that the president has the sole authority over the executive branch. And it reflects the influence of Russ Vought, Trump’s budget chief, one of several conservatives in his orbit who have called for axing independent arms of the executive branch.\\n\\nLook. He can sign an executive order declaring himself the Emperor of the Moon, but there is no basis in either the Constitution or in the enabling legislation establishing, say, the Federal Trade Commission or the Federal Election Commission that allows him to control them all. The legitimacy of this move, and of the other EOs, is based always on whether the rest of the branches of government accept them. As for the alleged constitutional basis of this power grab, it is complete moonshine.\\n\\nThe theory was long considered fringe, and many mainstream legal scholars still believe it is illegal, given that Congress set the agencies up specifically to act independently, or semi-independently, from the president. These include the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which enact regulations and can impose hefty fines on businesses that violate the rules.\\n\\nThe unitary executive theory was a fringe idea for decades. Back then, presidents thought being seen as a dictator was not necessarily politically advantageous. But gradually, a little at a time, like so many authoritarian ideas, through the endless network spawned by wing-nut welfare, the unitary executive oozed slowly toward the mainstream. It took the carefully manufactured conservative majority on the Supreme Court to open the sluice way back in 2021. From David Driesen (for the American Constitution Society):\\n\\nYet, the Supreme Court has embraced the unitary executive theory, which maintains that the President has sole control over the executive branch of government. In Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Court held that the Constitution gives the President the power to fire the sole director of the CFPB for political reasons and that a statute only authorizing for-cause removal was unconstitutional. The Court opined that this power to fire officials arbitrarily helped the President “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” The Seila Law Court, however, stopped short of overruling precedent accepting for-cause removal protection for members of independent multimember commissions performing quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial functions. At the same time, it eroded that precedent by only endorsing commission independence when the commission performs no executive functions. Just last month, however, the Court may have further undermined that earlier precedent in Collins v. Yellen, by declaring the nature of the power an agency exercised irrelevant to the constitutionality of for-cause removal protection.\\n\\nI am not optimistic about what happens when this power grab reaches the Nine Wise Souls again. Writing with what appears now to have been very rosy optimism in Federalist 76, Alexander Hamilton said that future presidents would be careful in their appointments because of the congressional oversight mixed in with executive power in the design of the Constitution.\\n\\nIt will readily be comprehended, that a man who had himself the sole disposition of offices, would be governed much more by his private inclinations and interests, than when he was bound to submit the propriety of his choice to the discussion and determination of a different and independent body, and that body an entire branch of the legislature. The possibility of rejection would be a strong motive to care in proposing. The danger to his own reputation, and, in the case of an elective magistrate, to his political existence, from betraying a spirit of favoritism, or an unbecoming pursuit of popularity, to the observation of a body whose opinion would have great weight in forming that of the public, could not fail to operate as a barrier to the one and to the other. He would be both ashamed and afraid to bring forward, for the most distinguished or lucrative stations, candidates who had no other merit than that of coming from the same State to which he particularly belonged, or of being in some way or other personally allied to him, or of possessing the necessary insignificance and pliancy to render them the obsequious instruments of his pleasure,\\n\\nCall me crazy, but this president seems notably unashamed and unafraid of bringing forward the obsequious instruments of his own pleasure.'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-19T18:15:00',\n",
       "   'content': 'While President Musk giggles like an evil toddler on his platform about the policy of mass deportation, it should be noted that it’s being carried out in the same reckless, meat-ax, half-assed fashion as anything else this administration does. Which means that innocent people are being tormented somewhere down the line that begins behind the Resolute desk. From The New York Times:\\n\\nThey arrived at the United States border from around the world, hoping to seek asylum. Instead, they were detained, shackled and flown by the U.S. military to a faraway country, Panama. They were stripped of their passports and most of their cellphones, they said, and then locked in a hotel, barred from seeing lawyers and told they would soon be sent to a makeshift camp near the Panamanian jungle. At the hotel, at least one person tried to commit suicide, according to several migrants. Another broke his leg trying to escape. A third sent a plaintive missive from a hidden cellphone: “Only a miracle can save us.”\\n\\nThe people in question are from Iran, Afghanistan, China, and other garden spots. Their main offense seems to be that they were here. That they are in Panama is no accident.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, U.S. officials began flying hundreds of people, including people from Asian, Middle Eastern, and African countries to Panama, which is under intense pressure to appease Mr. Trump, who has threatened to take over the Panama Canal.\\n\\nLeverage, my good man. Leverage.\\n\\nNow it will be Panamanian officials who decide what happens to them. Because the deported migrants are no longer on U.S. soil, Washington is not legally obligated to make sure they are treated humanely or have the chance to seek asylum.\\n\\nCynicism, my children, Cynicism.\\n\\nCosta Rica announced on Monday that it would also receive a flight from the United States, carrying 200 deportees from Central Asia and India. Panama and Costa Rica have said that the operations would be supervised by United Nations agencies and financed by the United States.\\n\\nThis would assuage some of my concern if this administration’s word could be trusted any further than one could throw a burning Tesla. My guess? These sponsoring countries and the United Nations are going to find out what some Atlantic City landscapers learned long ago.\\n\\nMuzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, called the Panama plan part of “a totally new era of enforcement,” in which Washington is coercing other nations into becoming part of its “deportation machinery.” … Lawyers in Panama say it is illegal to detain people without a court order for more than 24 hours. Yet roughly 350 migrants deported by the United States on three military planes have been locked in a soaring, glass-paneled hotel, the Decapolis Hotel Panama in Panama City, for nearly a week, while officials ready a camp near the jungle.\\n\\nAnd conditions in Hotel Hell have taken on a taste of luxury living in suburban Leavenworth, Kansas.\\n\\nArmed guards prevent any of the deportees from leaving the hotel. Several of them are children.… The Panamanian government has barred journalists from visiting the migrants. But The New York Times managed to interview several people inside the hotel, all of whom said they were asylum seekers being held against their will. In one window visible from a sidewalk below the hotel, a woman clawed at a latchless glass pane in an attempt to escape. When she noticed journalists below, she held up a piece of paper that read “Afghan.” She made hand motions that indicated an airplane, then her head falling off. The message seemed to be clear: A flight home meant death.\\n\\nA migrant from Iran, Artemis Ghasemzadeh, 27, wrote “Help us” in lipstick on one window. The Times, which was able to contact Ms. Ghasemzadeh and other deportees by cellphone, conducted interviews with her, several other Iranian deportees and a migrant from China. Many of the deportees wanted only their first or last names used out of fear that they would suffer reprisals if returned to their countries.\\n\\nIt was Ms. Ghasemzadeh who told a reporter “only a miracle can save us.”\\n\\nShe left Iran in December, she said, hoping to build a new life in the United States. She knew that Mr. Trump was deporting migrants, she added, but thought, “I’m not a criminal, I am educated, I will show them my qualifications, my conversion to Christianity papers.”\\n\\nAnd she wound up in a hotel in Panama, wondering if she will be held in a jungle detention camp or sent back to Iran with a death sentence on her head. Or both, because elections, my fellow citizens, and consequences.'},\n",

       "   'time': '2023-11-27T12:00:00',\n",
       "   'content': 'Mark Peterson/Redux\\n\\nDonald Trump won the 2020 election,” Steve Bannon pronounces. “Of that there is not even a question.\"\\n\\nObviously you expect me not to agree with you, I say. “Of course I expect you not to agree with me,” he says. “And I’m also not looking for you to agree with me. And I also don’t give a fuck who in the mainstream media agrees or disagrees with me.”\\n\\nAnd so off we go—about this and about Covid (the Bannon view: “It’s 100 percent a bioweapon—fucking not even a question”) and about vaccines (“I would never in ten million years get this vaccine,” Bannon says, and asks if I would; I simply hand him my vax card, which he looks at with apparent amazement: “I’ve never . . .”) and about what I view—but naturally Bannon doesn’t—as his incessant anti-Semitic dog-whistling. At one point, he rhapsodizes about the range of information available to people these days.\\n\\nOr misinformation, I say.\\n\\n“A wide range of information,” he counters. “One man’s misinformation may be somebody else’s Holy Grail, right?”\\n\\nI hardly agree—this seems a terrifying equivalence to me—but he’s already on to something else.\\n\\nWe are sitting out back of a home Bannon has near Tucson on the last day of July. The conversation is interrupted by a call on his cell. Here, for the record, is how Bannon says hello: “What the fuck don’t you understand about one o’clock?” The caller is Peter Navarro, who worked in the White House on economic issues throughout the Trump administration. Navarro went missing for this morning’s prerecorded episode of Bannon’s mouthpiece TV show and podcast, War Room, when Bannon was expecting him to pick apart Ron DeSantis’s new speech on economic policy. Bannon’s soon making nice but, as he often does, led with the loud.\\n\\nCall over, he’s soon back in the flow. When I ask him what he wants people to think of him, he offers up the manifesto of a valiant, tireless warrior.\\n\\nMark Peterson/Redux Asked about the potential for history to judge him wrong about everything, Bannon said, “That will be impossible.”\\n\\n“I don’t care,” he replies. “Whatever they think. You’ve got so much time in this vale of tears, right, to use your agency. And you’ve got to be able to look in the mirror every day and just say, I’m leaving it all on the field, and I’m nonstop, all that. And whatever they think, they think. Remember, as much as I’m hated by—and/or dismissed by—the mainstream media or the Left, I’m much more hated and dismissed by the Republican establishment. Hated. Hated. So I don’t care. History is going to be the judge. Remember, over time history judges things very differently. There are people today that are heroes that were looked at as goats. I mean, look at Oppenheimer. It changes over time. So I think you just got to do what you have to do and let the cards fall where they may. I can look at the results. I can see what’s happening. I see how we’re changing American political history. We’re ascending. We’re getting bigger.”\\n\\nAnd what if history decides you were wrong about everything?\\n\\n“That will be impossible.”\\n\\nWe continue this back-and-forth, which somehow seems both necessary and futile, for more than three hours, then take a break for the day. As for what happens later that evening, how you choose to interpret it may depend on how you feel about science and meteorology and the vagaries of energy flow; on how you feel about chance and numbers and the random play of improbable events; on how you feel about the existence or nonexistence of God and His interventionist tendencies; on how you feel about fate and symbols and auguries. And, of course, on how you feel about coincidences.\\n\\nThese, anyway, are the facts:\\n\\nBannon goes to bed early. Around eight o’clock in the evening, he is awoken by what sounds like an explosion. (“Dude, I’m telling you, we thought the house had blown up. I’ve never had, even on my Navy ship—I’ve never been that direct a hit.”) Right outside the front door of Bannon’s house, just to the left as you enter—and precisely above War Room’s makeshift Arizona studio—stands a date palm, maybe forty feet high. A lightning bolt had hit the palm’s trunk, just above the height of the roof, and flames are now climbing both upward to the fronds and down the trunk.\\n\\n“That entire beautiful palm was literally lit up like a torch,” Bannon tells me. “It was raining fire.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOne problem with hating pretty much everything Steve Bannon says and everything he stands for is that it might be exactly what he wants. “I hope they say I’m a devil,” he’ll tell me. “I hope they say I’m a fucking demon. I could give a fuck less. All I want to do is win.” Another is that maybe such dilemmas are a distraction, masking more crucial questions. For instance: Is Bannon truly someone forever playing the game several levels above and ahead of the rest of us, his every ambiguous zig and zag calculated to further a majestic master plan? Or is he actually just one more big-talking huckster, brazenly improvising whatever he can with whichever tools he can muster, making it all up as he goes? Or—maybe the most chastening possibility of all—might it be that in our modern-day runaway world of increasingly fractured and divided truths, there’s no longer a meaningful difference between the two?\\n\\nBannon’s past offers contradictory clues. He launched himself into most people’s consciousness as the unkempt, take-no-prisoners agitator who took over Donald Trump’s faltering presidential campaign in August 2016. After Trump defied most predictions by winning the election that November and Bannon was appointed chief strategist in the White House, a notorious Time magazine cover story suggested that Bannon might be the second-most-powerful man in the world. The implication was that Bannon—“the great manipulator,” as Time’s cover line proclaimed him—was pulling the strings of the first. Six months later, in circumstances that remain disputed, Bannon was gone. Since then, he has hovered hazily in the middle distance. Looked at through one lens, he is the radical Right’s great ideologue, propagandist, and strategist, orchestrating both overtly and covertly a global agenda that is currently focused on bringing Donald Trump back to the White House before fundamentally reordering American society. Looked at through another, that’s exactly what he needs people to think as he wages the endless uphill battle for relevance and influence.\\n\\nWhatever he is, he’s not lazy. War Room typically broadcasts live twenty-two hours a week, preaching a version of America crafted to horrify anyone not swept along with its relentless presentation of a country at the precipice’s edge, time running out unless enough good people inform themselves of the truths being hidden from them, then organize themselves to resist. To an outsider’s ears, it is not just the supposed truths, and the cavalcade of what are presented as supporting facts, that can seem at best unfamiliar, at worst poisonously inaccurate. This is a world with a whole disorientating language of its own. Here—to get a sense of both the substance and cadence of this upside-down world—is a selective glossary:\\n\\nThe Keebler Elves: Bannon’s disdainful collective term for the other candidates running against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination. Bannon, as an all-in Trump advocate, agitates against what he depicts as a pointless competition, a needlessly divisive distraction, and a waste of resources given that, in his way of seeing, the end result is already inevitable.\\n\\nMark Peterson/Redux Bannon often embraces harsh criticisms—that he’s “a cancer,” for example, or that he has no conscience—as a kind of proof of purpose.\\n\\nThe Biden crime family: It is an article of faith in this world not just that Hunter Biden’s international business relationships embodied an extensive, calculated corruption and criminality, one that has been systematically covered up by the Democratic and judicial establishments, but also that President Biden and other members of his family knowingly participated in, and received large sums of money from, these relationships, and that the president is consequently compromised in his dealings with sundry foreign powers.\\n\\nJudas Pence: Another inviolable article of faith in this world is that the 2020 election was stolen. For those who believe this, pretty much everything that ensued was part of a valiant fight for truth, a fight in which they were betrayed on January 6, 2021, by Vice President Pence’s supposed failure to prevent the certification of the 2020 vote.\\n\\nLawfare: A further article of faith is that all of the current legal proceedings against Donald Trump are coordinated charges that have been concocted to prevent his return to power, and that in this the judiciary is controlled and steered by the Democratic establishment in what amounts to an act of warfare by putatively legal means, i.e., lawfare.\\n\\nThe Uniparty: Bannon expresses as much, if not more, disdain and hate for the Republican establishment as for Democrats. In his vision, the two share so many common interests in the status quo that they resist in lockstep the kinds of radical changes Bannon believes are needed, effectively operating in the shadows as a single united party (an idea, Bannon points out, once explored in the writings of Gore Vidal).\\n\\nTV for stupid people: Bannon’s routine term for his hated Fox News, which he considers “an insidious cancer inside the conservative movement.”\\n\\n“No coincidences”: A phrase regularly invoked in reference to a sign in Bannon’s Washington studio that reads, “There are NO conspiracies, but there are NO coincidences. Stephen K. Bannon”—a convenient rhetorical back door to what often seems exactly like conspiratorial thinking.\\n\\nThe sunlit uplands: The term Bannon often throws out—generally, as with all these terms, without explanation—to denote a happier place we will eventually find ourselves at the end of the necessary turmoil he aims to instigate. The phrase is borrowed from a famous speech given by Winston Churchill in 1940 to inspire the British people in their fight against Hitler.\\n\\nThat is the sound of War Room. There are often, however, soft words about one particular subject. “We’re getting the best Trump right now,” Bannon told his audience this morning. “I can tell you, having had the honor and privilege of working with the president since 2016, when you meet, when you see him now in private, this is the best Trump we’ve ever had: on point, focused, on fire, take-no-prisoners, understands exactly what the task and purpose is.”\\n\\nLater, Bannon and I retire once more to his Arizona back patio for further conversation. A fountain burbles behind us; hummingbirds flit around. Lizards skitter across the ground. At one point a hawk flies by. “They keep the rats away,” he says, “so God bless them.” He continues where he left off on the show: “Here’s why I tell people, donors and all these guys. I said, You’re missing the point. You may hate Trump. You’re stuck with Trump. There’s nobody, while Trump’s breathing, that they’ll vote for.”\\n\\n\\n\\nEngaging in discourse with—and writing about—someone like Steve Bannon presents a peculiar challenge.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLast year, in The Atlantic magazine, Jennifer Senior wrote an extensive and compelling profile that forensically unpicked the ways she saw Bannon “attempting to insert a lit bomb into the mouth of American democracy.” Senior referred to his “industrial-grade bullshit” and “straight up megalomania” and to his War Room show as “a mighty river of ordure.” In her story, a chorus of former colleagues fingered Bannon as “a con man” and “a cancer,” someone who “stumbled into the MAGA movement as a way to make money and to get fame and fortune” and who “may well be mentally unstable, in a frightening, disturbing kind of way,” even someone who could be legitimately compared—“we have seen his sinister form before”—to Hitler. Though the article also respectfully strained to convey something of the world as Bannon sees it, I presume that most Atlantic readers consumed it as a devastating takedown.\\n\\nThough, as it turns out, not all of them.\\n\\n“I thought that was terrific,” Bannon tells me. “I thought it was a great piece.”\\n\\nIt’s hard not to let it get into your head, this imperviousness. It’s not just that Bannon seems impervious to the most obvious lines of attack; it’s that he seems to relish and feed off them. Here is CNN’s Jake Tapper speaking of this world: “And where do people like that go to share the big lie? MAGA media. . . . I wish, I wish in my soul, that any of these people had a conscience.” And why am I so familiar with this quote? Because it is part of the montage that begins every episode of War Room, a montage that is generally followed by fresh media snippets from the previous twenty-four hours, frequently showcasing full-on, pointed—and often, to my ears, effective—mainstream eviscerations of the latest events and tendencies in what we might call Bannon-Trump world. You might expect the targets of such critiques to ignore or sidestep them; instead, Bannon leans into them, as though he considers them testimonials, as proofs of purpose. For instance, one day in August he’ll play a long clip from Morning Joe of Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski taking apart the duplicitous logic of the Right, culminating in Scarborough saying, “They know it’s a lie. They really do. They know it’s a lie. They know the game they’re playing. . . . They can never just say, ‘It’s wrong that he stole nuclear secrets and no president or former president has ever done that in American history.’ ‘It’s wrong that he tried to overthrow a presidential election.’ ” And then the broadcast cuts to a clearly delighted Bannon, smirking. “This was a gem,” he tells his audience. “They’re just in full meltdown.” The front Bannon presents, whether as astute tactics or bluff, is: Agree with us and we fly. Attack us, deride us, scorn us, demean us and we soar.\\n\\nThis article appeared in the Winter 2023 issue of Esquire\\n\\nsubscribe\\n\\nNot long after Bannon left the White House, he was contacted by the documentarian Errol Morris. Back in 2003, Bannon had attended the American premiere of The Fog of War, Morris’s artful (and Oscar-winning) interrogation of Robert McNamara’s role in the debacles of the Vietnam War, at the Telluride Film Festival. “It’s one of the things that motivated me to really want to be, eventually, a documentary director,” says Bannon. (One of the many strands of Bannon’s earlier career—sometimes depicted as a triumphant restless visionary journey through a dazzling array of disciplines, sometimes as a textbook example of how a man who talks the right kind of game can keep failing upward—is his role as the maker of ambitious proselytizing right-wing documentaries.) “The nonlinear way he told the story just blew me away. Plus the fact that McNamara still didn’t quite get it, right?” Later, Bannon saw The Unknown Known, Morris’s 2013 film about Donald Rumsfeld: “I thought that was a disaster for Rumsfeld. I thought it exposed all the things that people had thought about him, of how he’s so certain on stuff—just like McNamara—and it’d get you in these horrible situations, right?” As Bannon remembers it, Morris now proposed making a film about Bannon that would be the third in this series, and Bannon’s response was this: “I said, Look, Robert McNamara and Rumsfeld, those guys are world historical figures. I’m some schmendrick that ran a little news site”—before taking over the Trump campaign in 2016, Bannon had been in charge of the right-leaning website Breitbart News—“and I spent a couple months at the White House. There’s no film there. And he goes: Let me determine that.”\\n\\nOn the surface, the strangest thing about Bannon’s account of this film’s genesis is his apparent lack of worry about being the third panel of a triptych, slotted in alongside Morris’s coruscating portrayals of McNamara and Rumsfeld. The resultant film, American Dharma, was anchored around excerpts from fifteen or so hours of Morris interviewing Bannon. “I made the movie ultimately because I was interested in Steve Bannon—or, if you like, the nature of Steve Bannon’s evil,” Morris tells me. “I’ve always been interested in difficult characters, in morally compromised characters, and Bannon didn’t seem to me in any way outside of that interest.” To its maker, it was perfectly clear what the movie showed. “American Dharma, properly considered, is a warning,” Morris says.\\n\\nBannon’s reaction to the film will, by now, come as little shock. “I thought it was fantastic,” he tells me. “If you look at Rumsfeld and McNamara, you come out and understand how they got us into these debacles and still don’t understand what they did. Well, I think there’s no doubt in that film Stephen K. Bannon fully understands exactly what he has helped wrought and is quite comfortable taking 100 percent accountability for that.”\\n\\nPerhaps more surprising—and perhaps a bellwether of the increasingly intolerant ways in which storytelling around divisive and controversial subjects is nowadays judged—was how many commentators saw American Dharma as sympathetic to Bannon, and unacceptably so. For whatever it was worth, in the interviews Morris gave to promote the film he allowed less room for doubt, talking of “Bannon’s sadism” and “almost diabolical destructiveness,” his “smokescreen of bullshit” and “world of real nastiness.” Morris warned that Bannon “is not a moron but he is a cynical bastard, and no one, absolutely no one, should turn their back on him” and noted that he might be “one of the most dangerous men in the world.”\\n\\nBannon tells me that he considers these last two observations compliments.\\n\\nThe morning after the lightning strike, Bannon stands outside his house, surveying the damage, alongside a man who has come to work out what should be done about it. The fire department arrived last night in about six minutes, extinguishing the flames, but the top half of the trunk is blackened and embers litter the ground. The palm tree, Bannon is told, is dead and must be removed. Bannon asks whether they can replace it with one of the same height.\\n\\n“Maybe a little bit shorter?” the man proposes. Bannon seems disheartened by this suggestion. The man points out that, in time, the new tree will grow.\\n\\n“Okay,” says Bannon, “but how long does it take to grow that high? I won’t be around that long.”\\n\\nBrent Stirton/Contour Photos/Getty Images Bannon was in the orbit of the January 6, 2021, insurrection—he spoke with former president Trump that morning and evening—but he hasn’t elaborated on his involvement.\\n\\nWhen we return to the back patio—the temperature will peak at 102 today, but Bannon is in his usual two collared shirts over a T-shirt—we further discuss Donald Trump. From the outside, his alliance with Trump has sometimes looked less than straightforward. Bannon concedes that he was not an easy fit with what was required in his abbreviated time in the White House. “Look, I’m incredibly headstrong, I got that,” he says. “And I want you to be a partner if you kind of agree with where we ought to go.” Immediately after his departure, he and his former boss remained in contact—when Bannon gave a high-profile interview about his experiences to 60 Minutes, Trump called him and was, says Bannon, “very positive.” A schism became apparent a few months later, in January 2018, when Michael Wolff’s book Fire and Fury, an intimate account of the Trump presidency’s early days, was published. Bannon appeared to be a key source, and his views of Trump and others around him were not always flattering. Trump put out a statement denouncing Bannon—“when he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind”—then followed up with a tweet referring to “Sloppy Steve Bannon, who cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad!”\\n\\n“That’s a great line,” says Bannon when I cite the “cried when he got fired” sentence. “It’s a great line. I’ve got an older brother, so I know how people say things. I think if you asked President Trump today, he would say that was quite an exaggeration.”\\n\\nDid you cry?\\n\\n“No. God no. I resigned. I wasn’t fired. I resigned.”\\n\\nBannon argues that he has always been a loyalist. He points out that after January 6, 2021, most people peeled away, assuming that the Trump era had come to an end, but Bannon never did: “I had a lot of people call me, say, ‘It’s over, and you’re a smart guy, and you can help drive this into a positive way.’ I said, ‘That’s not a positive way. You’re just surrendering. I’m never going to stop. You scratch me and you just get a hardheaded mick.’ ” (Bannon often refers to his Irish family heritage in this way, usually in the context of resilience, hotheadedness, and stubbornness.) “ ‘It’s just the way I’m built. And we’re not going to stop. And I can see, if we hold, that Trump’s going to return to the White House.’ People fucking laughed at my face.”\\n\\nTwo and a half years later, with Trump the presumptive Republican nominee, that laughter has subsided. And as for his actual relationship with Trump now, Bannon says this: “I don’t want to talk about the specific conversations, but we speak pretty frequently, yeah. . . . It’s normally about what’s happening on the show and the clips and the poll numbers and what’s happening at the rallies.”\\n\\nGiven those words, and also bearing in mind the impression of personal intimacy with Trump I’ve heard Bannon convey to his War Room audience, what I will now relate might be taken as evidence of just how strange and unconventional the deep bond running between Trump and Bannon is. Though it could also, if you are so minded, be used to question its nature, or even its very existence.\\n\\nOn April 28, 2023, Bannon filmed a live episode of War Room from the library of Mar-a-Lago, a special to promote the vainglorious new coffee-table book Letters to Trump. The broadcast began with Bannon speaking with the book’s publisher, Sergio Gor. About fifteen minutes in, well ahead of the agreed schedule, Trump appeared off camera and greeted Bannon. “He starts smiling: ‘My Steve!’ ” Bannon recounts. The show cut to an ad break, and when it returned, Trump was in the interviewee seat, answering Bannon’s questions.\\n\\nAll very unremarkable, you might think, except for one astonishing aspect: By Bannon’s own account, this moment was the first time he and Trump had met in the flesh since Bannon left the White House in August 2017, almost six years earlier.\\n\\nBannon fills me in on how things proceeded that day. How afterward Trump invited him to stay for dinner, and though at first Bannon demurred, Trump insisted. And how they were then joined by Melania. Bannon describes the ensuing reintroductions: “He goes, ‘Steve . . . Melania.’ I go, ‘First Lady, so great to see you again. Haven’t seen you in a long time.’ She goes, ‘I always liked you, Steve.’ And I go, ‘I know, Melania, you and I, we hate the same people.’ And she laughed. A very knowing laughter.”\\n\\nI ask Bannon whether he wants to give me a list, assuming he’ll sidestep, but he doesn’t entirely.\\n\\n“Listen,” he says, “it’s no doubt we had some hard feelings with Jared and Ivanka and others. . . .”\\n\\nAt dinner, he says, they all talked, and sitting there at the table, Trump DJed from his iPad.\\n\\n“He knows Melania hates it when he’s DJing,” Bannon notes.\\n\\nThere has since been a second meeting between Bannon and Trump, on July 19, before a screening of the movie The Sound of Freedom at Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Bannon says that he spoke with Trump for about twenty minutes beforehand and also had a long conversion with Jared Kushner, one he presents as a rapprochement.\\n\\nOne day, we go on an outing. The many twists of Steve Bannon’s early career have been well-documented but are nonetheless littered with curiosities, and the site of one of these lies a half hour or so north of where we are. Biosphere 2 was completed in 1991, a self-contained, domed system of different environments in which a group of people would be enclosed for extended periods of time and studied as they tried to subsist. At the time, what seemed like a weird futuristic experiment was an object of intense media coverage and some controversy, and in 1993 an investment banker was brought in to rationalize parts of the operation. This was Steve Bannon, who ended up running the project for about two years, along with a team including his younger brother Chris.\\n\\nChris is still involved, and today the three of us are heading up there. Steve has lost his glasses, so Chris drives. In the front, they talk about sharing a bedroom in their home in Richmond when they were young and reminisce about the local band they loved to see all the time, Steel Mill—“played at my high school, at the prom,” says Bannon. Steel Mill being Bruce Springsteen’s band before he had a recording contract. (This tracks. In his autobiography, Born to Run, Springsteen describes how Richmond became Steel Mill’s second home, where they built up a following and even “got hired for school events.” It was, Springsteen wrote, “one of the two places where we could make a buck.”) And then Bannon’s off, talking about seeing the Dead in ’73 and New Riders of the Purple Sage. On the Biosphere 2 property, before Chris Bannon gives me a tour (the Biosphere itself, part research site, part tourist attraction, is now run by the University of Arizona), we first go to the ranch house where Steve Bannon lived for two years in the 1990s—without, as he notes, air conditioning—and continue our conversations. I’ve told Bannon I want to talk to him about Michael Wolff’s books. Over a series of publications—2018’s Fire and Fury, 2019’s Siege, 2021’s Too Famous (and, to a lesser degree, 2021’s Landslide)—Wolff could be seen as the great chronicler of Steve Bannon, though perhaps not always of the man Bannon would now wish people to see.\\n\\nThe discussion gets puzzling right from the start. When I ask Bannon when he first met Wolff, his response is “After I left the White House? I don’t remember.” When I press that Wolff was clearly around him before that, Bannon offers a second, very specific date—that it was when Wolff and Kellyanne Conway did an onstage interview about the first hundred days of the Trump administration, which was on April 12, 2017. This perplexes me, but for now I decide not to challenge him further on it. Likewise, when I read Bannon a summary Wolff has written of their interactions—“We logged hundreds of hours of conversation together in Trump Tower, the White House, the frat-style accommodations he occupied on Capitol Hill, the luxury suites he favored when he was in New York, during a trip to Europe we took together, and over dinners at my house in Greenwich Village”—Bannon says, “Ridiculous,” adding, “I have ex-wives I haven’t spent hundreds of hours with.” (Bannon has been married three times—his eldest daughter, Maureen, works mostly behind the scenes at War Room—but says that these days he has no ongoing romantic relationship. “I’ve directed my chakras in a different direction,” he says. “I’ll be seventy shortly. I got a window here to have an impact.” In this regard, he mentions something that I can’t get out of my head. He tells me that even years ago, when he’d interview people for his own firm, his second or third question would be about their personal life. He says that it didn’t matter what they actually said: If they spoke for more than sixty seconds in response, they wouldn’t be hired.)\\n\\nAs Bannon tells me that he has read none of Wolff’s books, I quote to him some relevant passages. I do so less in the expectation that the 2023 version of Bannon is likely to reaffirm the opinions that Wolff reports he once had and shared, more in trying to understand how his present role and his relationship with Trump may—or may not—transcend this material. For instance, there’s this passage from Siege: “But Bannon also believed that if you could get around Trump’s repellent character, intellectual deficiencies, and glaring mental health issues, you ought to be able to see that Trump was being savaged—with the powers that be trying to run him out of office—for doing much of what he had been elected to do. Trumpism, in fact, was working.”\\n\\n“I haven’t heard these,” Bannon responds, “and I think the reason that you haven’t heard these is that people realize it’s nonsense. It’s just Wolff trying to sell books. Is anybody out there in the media right now, anybody out there in the Republican staff, anybody out there, either lovers of Trump or haters of Trump, that don’t understand that I am Trump’s closest ally?”\\n\\nJared Siskin // Getty Images Author Michael Wolff has written extensively about Trump. When Bannon appeared to be a key source in Wolff’s 2018 book Fire and Fury, about the early days of the Trump presidency, Trump took to calling his former advisor “Sloppy Steve Bannon.”\\n\\nAt one point, as I read him a series of further examples of how Bannon was said to have, as Wolff summarized in 2021, “conducted a riotously entertaining monologue about Trump and his family’s stupidity, avarice, incompetence, and corruption,” Bannon protests that if all this were true, “Why would Trump and I be this close today?” Which is, indeed, in all kinds of ways, the question.\\n\\nThe most explicitly damning material comes from the later books, but it was Fire and Fury that drew Trump’s “Sloppy Steve” pushback and so whose contents Trump presumably has some knowledge of. One passage—which I also read back to Bannon—strikes me as particularly relevant, again not so much for what it says about Trump’s capabilities (a debate that has its own life out in the world) but for how Trump might feel about someone who has questioned them like this: “Steve Bannon was telling people he thought there was a 33.3 percent chance that the Mueller investigation would lead to the impeachment of the president, a 33.3 percent chance that Trump would resign, perhaps in the wake of a threat by the cabinet to act on the Twenty-fifth Amendment (by which the cabinet can remove the president in the event of his incapacitation), and a 33.3 percent chance that he would limp to the end of his term. In any event, there would certainly not be a second term, or even an attempt at one. ‘He’s not going to make it,’ said Bannon at the Breitbart Embassy. ‘He’s lost his stuff.’ ”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No,” Bannon tells me. “I don’t remember saying that.”\\n\\nI mention other sources I’ve come across that seem to echo, and attribute to Bannon, something of the same idea. One is a quote I read in an interview with the 60 Minutes producer Ira Rosen, promoting a book he had written, referring to how Bannon had told him about Trump showing signs of early-stage dementia and raising the genuine possibility that because of this, Trump might be removed from office by the Twenty-fifth Amendment.\\n\\n“Nonsense,” says Bannon when I relay what Rosen said. “Total nonsense. And I’ve never talked to Rosen, ever, except for the 60 Minutes interview, ever.” Bannon further argues that for that 60 Minutes interview, he had agreed to answer questions on anything—if he had said this to the show’s producer, why didn’t they ask about it in the interview? “No, I certainly never had that opinion. I don’t ever remember expressing it. President Trump—look how sharp he is today. I don’t remember anybody ever questioning his ability to perform the office.”\\n\\nI ask him how he feels, if so, about a story like this being out there.\\n\\n“It’s irrelevant. Nobody talks about it. Trump knows it’s bullshit. I didn’t even know he’d written a book. Have you heard anybody talk about that? Listen, I sell books—just the mention of Bannon and you can make whatever. . . . This is why, if I had to chase down every . . . remember, I’m an anti-Semite, I’m a white nationalist . . .”\\n\\nAnd, for now, we talk of other things.\\n\\nWhatever Bannon did or didn’t once say about him, his proximity to Trump and his ideas has certainly had marked legal consequences. Bannon was somewhere in the orbit of the events of January 6, 2021. He was part of strategic Washington hotel discussions in the days before and spoke to Trump both in the morning and evening of January 6, but beyond that he has refused to clarify much further. Whether out of abstract principle or contrariness or because he had secrets he didn’t want to tell, Bannon refused to comply with a subpoena to testify before the select committee investigating January 6. He was subsequently charged with contempt of Congress, found guilty, and sentenced to four months in prison, a verdict he is appealing.\\n\\nBrandon Bell Bannon at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in 2022. He routinely fosters the notion among his followers that he is close with former president Trump.\\n\\nThat is not the only legal peril he has been facing. In August 2020, Bannon was one of four men accused of diverting funds from a nonprofit, We Build the Wall, established to raise money for the private construction of barriers on the U. S.–Mexico border. If Bannon expected support from a president neck-deep in reelection maneuverings, none was forthcoming. “I didn’t like that project,” said Trump when the news of Bannon’s arrest broke. “I thought that was a project that was being done for showboating reasons.” (Bannon blames others for this: “That’s what Jared had told him. . . . Knowing the facts as he knows them now, he’s, I think, very supportive.”) Bannon’s three codefendants are now in jail. And Bannon? On Trump’s final day in office, he was pardoned.\\n\\nI ask Bannon how he got the pardon.\\n\\n“I have no idea,” he avers. “It was just him.”\\n\\nYou must have advocated for it.\\n\\n“No, never.”\\n\\nReally?\\n\\n“No. Never advocated.” Bannon adds that he believes Rudy Giuliani may have brought it up “of his own volition.”\\n\\nBut you must have been pleased for it to happen?\\n\\n“Sure. Definitely. There’s no doubt about that. I think that’s President Trump. I think he can think these things through.”\\n\\nWhy do you think he did it?\\n\\n“I think he did it because he knows I’m an honest guy.”\\n\\nNot that the whole affair is behind him. In September 2022, Bannon was indicted on state charges, which are unaffected by a presidential pardon, related to the same events. He claims to be unworried. “I have no doubt I’ll be exonerated at trial,” he says. “I never took one penny from this.” Likewise, when it comes to the four-month sentence he already faces, he professes to be “100 percent confident” that he will never serve any time. He talks about all these legal matters as though they’re just bothersome, minor paperwork errors that will be corrected in due course. It’s hard to determine how much of this is smart strategic thinking and clearheaded analysis, how much is unanchored self-belief, and how much is pure bluff.\\n\\n\\n\\nThose things Bannon told me in Arizona, when pushing back against people who had reported comments he had made in earlier times about Trump . . . afterward, I can’t figure them out. Did he think I wouldn’t check further? Had he really reshaped the past in his memory to better fit the present? Does he genuinely think none of it really matters? Or did he just think that handling these questions as he did was the best tactic, however strong or weak his hand?\\n\\nEither way, much of what he said that was checkable seems to have been wildly far from the truth. First, Michael Wolff. Bannon had eventually indicated to me that his initial contact with Wolff came in April 2017, in the first hundred days of the Trump presidency. Many of the details contradicting this are in Wolff’s books, and I also spoke with Wolff to clarify things further. Wolff describes first encountering Bannon at the Orlando airport in early 2016, when it was Bannon, who was still running Breitbart News, who recognized and approached Wolff. That summer, soon after Bannon took over the Trump campaign, he invited Wolff up to Trump Tower. “I probably saw him three or four times that fall,” Wolff says; they carried on speaking throughout his time in the White House. “I liked him,” says Wolff. “I mean, he was an enormous pleasure to spend time with. He could not have been more open, more accessible—a better source and better company.” When I tell Wolff that Bannon pushed back against the notion that they had logged hundreds of hours of conversation over the years, he says, “Well, it’s all on tape.” He confirms that he heard Bannon’s disparaging summary of Trump’s chances, and of Trump having lost his stuff, directly from Bannon. “Oh yeah, many times,” Wolff says. “I mean, possibly he’s convinced himself otherwise. I don’t know. As I say, I have not spoken to him in some amount of time, but he’s come to make his money off of a different point of view. He knows where his bread is buttered. He plays a role. I mean, in a sense, when I was with him he was just playing a different role. At the time, he was the apostate Trump, the clear-eyed person, and all of the other people were incredible sycophants.”\\n\\nThen there’s Ira Rosen, the 60 Minutes producer whom Bannon claimed to barely know, telling me he only ever spoke to him for the 60 Minutes interview. I get hold of a copy of Rosen’s book, Ticking Clock: Behind the Scenes at 60 Minutes. The story it tells is so at odds with what Bannon professed that it is staggering. Rosen explains how he first met Bannon when working on a 60 Minutes story about insider trading in Washington—this was back in 2011—and how Bannon subsequently became someone he would meet up with periodically when Bannon was in New York. Rosen would trawl for gossip about Fox’s Roger Ailes while Bannon “encouraged me to do stories about the Washington swamp.” Immediately after Bannon took over the Trump campaign, Rosen, too, was invited up to the campaign headquarters. In his book, Rosen details some of their interactions and conversations, noting in passing that he and Bannon have exchanged more than a thousand text messages.\\n\\n\\n\\nCamerique/ClassicStock In 1993 Bannon, then an investment banker, was hired to help run Biosphere 2, near Tucson, a domed system of man-made environments where humans can practice subsistence. His brother, Chris, is still involved.\\n\\nAs for what Rosen says that Bannon told him about Trump’s purported dementia? One very good reason this didn’t form part of the substance of Bannon’s 60 Minutes interview is that these exchanges took place in the weeks and months afterward. Here is what Rosen wrote: “His criticism of Trump privately to me took on a different tone. He believed Trump was suffering from early-stage dementia and that there was a real possibility he would be removed from office by the Twenty-fifth Amendment, where the cabinet could vote that the president was no longer mentally capable of carrying out his duties. Bannon began to push that story hard. Bannon said that the president had no attention span, didn’t read, and now doesn’t listen. He said Trump repeats himself a lot, telling the same story minutes after he told it before.” In the book, Rosen describes how he sent Bannon an extract from a David Brooks column in The New York Times recounting that a group of senators recently meeting with Trump had seen “a president so repetitive and rambling, some thought he might be suffering from early Alzheimer’s,” and that Bannon texted back, “You need to do the 25th amendment piece . . . BTW brother I never steer u wrong.” I call up Rosen, who reaffirms that all of this is documented.\\n\\nAfter I leave Arizona, Bannon texts me intermittently, but the tempo increases as the battle toward a possible government shutdown nears. “Next couple of weeks going to be crazy nasty,” he predicts. “Toxic and Lit.” Reading his texts and watching his shows, I find it difficult to determine how much he is reporting on events and how much he may be playing a role in orchestrating them. (He certainly often seems to know what is going to happen next well before it happens.)\\n\\nA couple days before the shutdown deadline at the end of September, I visit Bannon in Washington. He returned from Arizona earlier that week. The burned-up palm tree, he updates me, has been taken down—“It broke my heart,” he says—but he’s still resisting its replacement by a shorter tree. He wants one the same size. He chooses to offer the following troubling analogy: He was always adamant that they should have built back the World Trade Center towers exactly where they were but one foot taller. “I want my palm tree,” he says.\\n\\nWe are in the Breitbart Embassy, just a couple blocks from the Capitol. (Bannon has War Room studios in various homes, but this is the principal one.) As ever, he is personally affable in a way that offers an almost baffling contrast to so many of his words and opinions. It’d be convenient to assume that this is all a front, that he is working me, but while I certainly don’t discount that component, for the most part I think that’s too easy an explanation. Whoever Steve Bannon in messy aggregate actually is, I don’t think you can begin to understand him without acknowledging that this version—the often considerate, genial, self-deprecating, open-to-other-opinions one—is, maybe confoundingly, a real part of him, too.\\n\\nI expect today’s conversation to be awkward. After we spend maybe an hour scuffling back and forth on other matters, I move to the lengthy list of statements and disavowals he made in Arizona that don’t seem to tally with what I’ve since found. Regarding his interactions with Michael Wolff, Bannon initially reiterates that he first met Wolff when he was in the White House but when pressed now recalls an earlier encounter the previous fall when Wolff was writing an article for The Hollywood Reporter. But we reach an impasse over many of the opinions and words Wolff describes and quotes Bannon as saying. “You have to come to your own assessment,” Bannon eventually declares. “You’re the writer. This shouldn’t be a tough one you have to struggle with. Two people have very different opinions.”\\n\\nI know, but one of them has got the quotes and the documented record of it, and I find it very hard to get past that.\\n\\n“Then you’re going to have to write that that’s true and that I’m lying to you and I misled you. I don’t have a problem with that.”\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\n“This is not an existential moment.”\\n\\nIt feels to me that what he is saying here is something like this: People like you are hung up on the quaint idea that it’s truth that always matters the most. Sure, it has its uses, but in the big picture—and especially when things really heat up—it’s often way down any sensible list of priorities.\\n\\nWhen I move on to Ira Rosen and remind Bannon what he told me about only speaking to Rosen around the 60 Minutes interview, he immediately says, “Yes,” agreeing with himself. I explain that Rosen’s book gives a very different impression. “I don’t care what he says in his book,” Bannon retorts. I press on regardless.\\n\\nWould you agree that you were constantly texting each other?\\n\\n“I don’t remember that. So he’s got the text?”\\n\\nYeah. He says he has more than a thousand texts.\\n\\n“Are they in the book?”\\n\\nSome of them.\\n\\n“I don’t remember.”\\n\\nAre you saying they don’t exist?\\n\\n“I’m saying I don’t remember being in constant contact with Ira Rosen.”\\n\\nIt feels obvious to me that here and elsewhere Bannon is navigating a careful, evanescently thin line: repudiating what he can and then otherwise saying that he doesn’t remember, whether or not these are things someone could credibly fail to remember, rather than fully calling anyone a liar, with all the awkward new doors that might open.\\n\\nWhen I remind Bannon that Rosen’s name first came up, back in Arizona, when I read him Rosen’s quote about the Twenty-fifth Amendment, Bannon protests with renewed confidence as he did before—grounds for repudiation!—that if this were true it would have been asked about in the 60 Minutes interview. When I point out that this all took place after that, Bannon recalibrates his defense. “How did I have that then?” he says, as though he was suddenly so removed from Trump world that he would have had no means of judging anything like that about his former boss. “I didn’t speak to Trump for years,” he says. “That’s ridiculous.” (Aside from the fact that this contradicts both the general impression he has given me and others and his description to me of the call Trump made to him in Hong Kong after the 60 Minutes interview, Bannon is on more formal record stating otherwise. When he was interviewed by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence investigating purported Trump ties to Russia, on January 16, 2018, he was asked how many times he had spoken with Trump since leaving the White House. At first he answered, “I don’t remember,” but when pressed, “Is it more than ten?” he replied, “Yes.”)\\n\\nI say that Rosen claims to have all of this documented and read to Bannon his own text about the Twenty-fifth Amendment.\\n\\n“Okay, well, then you’ll have to go with . . .” He pauses. “I don’t remember that. And I don’t remember having that relationship with Ira Rosen.”\\n\\nA couple minutes later, Bannon tries a different tack. “Haven’t you been in the same situation as those two guys? Have I told you anything untoward to the president? That’s a yes-or-no question.”\\n\\nI agree that he has not.\\n\\n“Okay, fine,” he says, as though a point has been proved.\\n\\nI suggest that the real takeaway is maybe that he used to share a lot of uncareful thoughts with people and that he’s learned not to do so.\\n\\nDrew Angerer Trump speaks by phone to Russian president Vladimir Putin from the Oval Office on January 28, 2017, accompanied by, from left, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Vice President Mike Pence, and Bannon, then the White House Chief Strategist.\\n\\n“Then you’re going to have to write it how you have to write it,” he says. “We just have a disagreement. I think I’ve been very straightforward. Did we put any restrictions on this at all? You’re going to write what you’re going to write. You will lay out your case about Steve Bannon the way you see it. It’s your perspective. I have no problem with that. I’m not sitting here trying to talk you out of it: ‘Oh, please don’t . . .’ You just got to do what you got to do. Can I say something else? It’s also—it’s meaningless. But you ought to write it as you see it.”\\n\\nI ask him to explain what he means by “it’s meaningless.”\\n\\n“Because everybody knows that my loyalty to this movement and to him are unquestioned. If you look at the demonstrable record, there’s not even a question of who’s gone out of their way to support Trump the man and Trump the politician and the Trump movement. That’s just irrefutable fact. A couple of guys saying, ‘Hey, he said this, he said this’? That’s fine. I disagree with that. I don’t remember it. I don’t remember having long relationships with Michael Wolff or with particularly Ira Rosen. But I feel quite comfortable with my place in history, juxtaposed to what I’ve accomplished and what we’re accomplishing here. I feel pretty damn good.”\\n\\nHe says this as though it should, or even could, prove that the other stuff—the leaking and the careless trash-talking—is not true. (Bannon likes to use false binaries as a rhetorical device.) But of course they can both be true, and I suspect that they probably both broadly are. I try to return to the main reason, weeks ago, that I was asking about any of this—its effect, or otherwise, on his relationship with Trump. I begin by saying that although perhaps Trump is not aware chapter and verse of all this stuff that’s been published—at which point Bannon interrupts.\\n\\n“Oh, he knows it,” says Bannon. “Trust me. Anything has been published, they have put under his nose many times.”\\n\\nWe talk about different ways someone like Trump might view all this, and I float the possibility that Trump might allow someone like Bannon back in but that one’s card is nonetheless marked permanently, and one would never really be trusted. Bannon surprises me by allowing this possibility.\\n\\n“It may be,” he says. “It may be. Time will tell on that.”\\n\\nBoth in Arizona and in Washington, Bannon seemed keen that I should speak with Trump. Esquire sent the former president a series of questions about his and Bannon’s relationship but received no response.\\n\\nBy now I’ve spent a couple months watching War Room every day. I don’t agree with much, and I sometimes worry that I’m getting desensitized to thoughts that in clear fresh air would horrify me, but there are parts that I can just about see as fair’s-fair strong partisan advocacy. When it comes to issues like immigration and the war in Ukraine and the debt ceiling, while one might strongly dispute much of what is presented as fact, and the conclusions reached, these are nonetheless real, difficult quandaries where there exist good reasons for sensible, thoughtful people to disagree. Sometimes, though—a lot of the vaccine stuff, for instance—it just seems to me like crazy conspiratorial nonsense. Likewise the way in which disasters of almost any kind—the fire in Maui, the war in Israel, for instance—are opportunistically grabbed, with what seems to me as sickening glee, as notional proof of tendentious, and again often conspiratorial, government malfeasance. And every now and again what is broadcast seems just so nasty and vengeful and wrongheaded that I feel soiled just watching. As an example, there’s a recurrent subtext, dog-whistled but perfectly transparent, often when child trafficking is being discussed, that intimates in true QAnon style that some broad coalition of the Democratic and Hollywood establishment consists of pedophiles. Both what is being said and the manipulative if-you’re-smart-and-paying- attention-you’ll-know wink are repellent.\\n\\nAs accustomed as I become to all this, sometimes my reactions take me by surprise. One Wednesday in mid-September, Bannon launches into a sustained invective against Merrick Garland that, somehow, seems to step so far, heedlessly and recklessly, over any line. It’s the words themselves—“he is a purely evil individual . . . and he will pay for the evilness when we imprison him”—but also how insensibly and self-righteously angry Bannon seems. It makes good enough sense for Bannon, from his perspective, to disagree with Garland, and also to question whether Garland’s every decision is made in good faith. And I certainly doubt that Garland is without his flaws. But this attack just seems both wildly poisonous and, in its scale and certainty, empirically wrong. As Bannon himself says, history reveals. I suppose history could endorse Bannon’s view, but all my instincts are that there is no sensible reason for thinking this to be true, wherever you stand politically—and that to proclaim this, never mind potentially inspire people to act on its basis, goes unacceptably beyond fighting one’s corner.\\n\\nAt one point during our conversation in Washington, Bannon challenges me. “Do you think I believe this?” he asks, meaning what he advocates sitting here in the War Room studio. I explain, quite honestly, that I have thought about this question a lot. And then I tell him how shocked I was by the Merrick Garland diatribe.\\n\\n“I think Merrick Garland is evil. I shocked you?”\\n\\nYes, it really shocks me. Not only do I think you’re wrong; I think it’s disgusting that you think that.\\n\\n“Okay. Okay.”\\n\\nI can’t believe that there’s anything that you know that gives you the prerogative to think that.\\n\\n“Why do you say that? All the facts are out there of what he’s done. Look, he’s overseen rolling up of a thousand of these people. This one guy we talked about yesterday is three years hadn’t gone to trial. That’s pure evil of what he’s done about the J Six thing. Pure evil.”\\n\\nThat’s not evil. The whole thing was a complete shit show, and the rule of law is slowly working its way through it.\\n\\n“It’s not the rule of law. Upgrading to terrorism charges?”\\n\\nThere’s plenty to argue about there. I think Garland is trying to do his job. Evil? I don’t agree at all.\\n\\nChip Somodevilla Florida Republican Matt Gaetz (second from left, next to Tennessee Republican Tim Burchett), speaks to reporters in October 2023 during maneuverings over the House speakership. Gaetz, who made efforts to win concessions for MAGA Republicans, was a frequent guest on Bannon’s show during the chaotic run-up to a potential government shutdown.\\n\\n“This is the unbridgeable gap in the country. They think we’re evil. I saw last night! They think we’re building the Confederate army. That’s on MSNBC. That’s their belief. We’re building the Confederate army. They think we are pure evil. They think we’re racist. They think we’re domestic terrorists. They think we’re insurgents. This is what they think. And we think they’re evil. And you’re not going to bridge that gap.”\\n\\nBut that’s a tragedy.\\n\\n“Why is it a tragedy?”\\n\\nBecause in those terms, I think that you’re both wrong. (That is to say, insomuch as Bannon’s extreme characterization of the “other” side is accurate.)\\n\\n“Okay. You’re a reasonable man in the middle. You can weigh in measuring—you’re a kindhearted person, you think both sides are wrong. It’s like Ecclesiastes. It’s just not your time. I hate to say it: It’s just not your time. It’s us versus them. They hate us and we hate them. One side’s going to win here. And it’s going to get ugly. It’s going to get messy.”\\n\\nIn the days around and after my Washington trip, Bannon becomes far more visibly at the center of things.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven so, the looming end-of-September shutdown at first seems to play like something of a humiliation for him. His preference seemed to be for a disorderly shutdown, or at the very least for there to be major concessions to the MAGA wing. His show has been filled with those like Matt Gaetz maneuvering for this, and Bannon appears to be deeply involved in the strategizing. Then, on the final afternoon, Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy makes a last-minute deal with the Democrats. The tempo of Bannon’s texts had been increasing, but after that, contact dries up and I assume that he is smarting. Gaetz has consistently said, and Bannon has echoed loudly, that if McCarthy did anything like this, Gaetz would move for McCarthy’s removal. Now Gaetz must either back down and look weak or press ahead, but the conventional wisdom is that his bluff has been called and he will be put in his place. Either hardcore MAGA Republicans will blanch at taking this final step or the Democrats will passively or actively move to allow McCarthy’s survival; Gaetz will be isolated as an extremist renegade.\\n\\nI’m traveling, so I don’t learn the result of the vote at the time. Not for another six minutes, anyway, when my phone pings with a two-word text from Bannon: “Told Ya.” McCarthy has gone, Congress is in turmoil, and things have played out Bannon’s way. By the end of the week, Bannon is back on the front cover of The New York Times, photographed in mid-broadcast, jabbing the index finger of his left hand to drive home a point.\\n\\nStill, after that, it zigs and zags back and forth. Candidates opposed by Bannon, candidates supported by him, crash and burn all the same. After two weeks of this, I text him, asking what way he sees out of this chaos. Or, I add, is the chaos okay?\\n\\nHis answer comes back immediately.\\n\\n“Chaos,” he writes, “is our friend.”\\n\\nThis, of course, is just a skirmish. Just a minor messiness. When the MAGA–friendly Mike Johnson eventually prevails as Speaker, I get a sense that for Bannon this is less a major victory than a fruitful bit of low-level agitation. The real mess, the real chaos, the real if-you-tear-it-down-they-will-come rupture . . . if Steve Bannon has his way, and he seems hell-bent on doing so, that is still to come.'},\n",

From The New Republic:\\n\\nBut one downsizing just started attracting notice among insiders at the National Institutes of Health, because it seems particularly inexplicable: According to people familiar with the situation, approximately one-tenth of the workers have now been let go at the NIH’s Center for Alzheimer’s and Related Dementias, or CARD, including its incoming director, a highly regarded scientist credited with important innovations in the field.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn Tuesday afternoon, at a meeting inside CARD’s building at NIH in Bethesda, Maryland, employees were informed that a sizable swath of the center’s workers were being fired, according to an employee who was at the meeting. One of those being dismissed, the source says, is Kendall Van Keuren-Jensen, who had been tapped to eventually become CARD’s acting director, replacing the current director, Andrew Singleton, who is reportedly set to depart.\\n\\nWe are so very close. Maybe not to a cure but to the ability to arrest the progress of the disease so that it becomes a chronic condition that can be managed with medication while research toward a cure can go forward. Unless, of course, a bunch of postadolescents in cargo shorts come in and scramble all the work being done because breaking things is fun, dude.\\n\\nThe firing of Van Keuren-Jensen, CARD’s incoming director, is seen as particularly damaging to the cause by people familiar with the situation. They describe her as a leading researcher in the Alzheimer’s field, including when it comes to innovations enabling early detection of the disease. They note that CARD worked hard to recruit her, and while she can be replaced, they say her hiring would have enabled the center to make great strides in the field that are now in doubt. The other firings, which include senior researchers in the field, will also put those advances at risk, those people say.\\n\\nForty years ago this May, my father drove to pick up geraniums to plant on the family graves. The flower store was about a half mile away from his house. The next we heard of him was several days later, and he was in Montpelier, Vermont. That was my introduction to the disease that would clear-cut the generation before me, claiming not only my father but also all four of his siblings, and that has hung over me for four decades the way it has hung over millions of my fellow citizens. I have no sympathy for all the Republicans who now express dismay over what is being done to millions of their constituents, who now express dismay that the federal grant money that enriched their home states’ universities and who will continue to express this dismay as the assault continues, but who run like rabbits at the first sign of pushback. Gabe Sherman at Vanity Fair has an interesting report on how many of the Republicans in Congress are intimidated into voting for policies they know are wrong. Tough. These are the times that try men’s souls, as old Tom Paine once said. Do the right thing or get the hell out. There are people dying out there.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-13T20:44:00',\n",
       "   'content': 'Where do you go when the only Republican senator with any stones at all is the guy who helped wreck the Supreme Court for a generation? From NPR:\\n\\nKennedy faced opposition from the left for his decades of espousing conspiracy theories on vaccines and from the right for his past support of abortion rights. For several weeks, it was uncertain whether he had enough senators backing him to get through. Yesterday, Democratic senators made speeches on the floor past midnight in protest. But on Thursday morning, he had the votes to be confirmed. The vote was 52 to 48. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the former Republican majority leader and a polio survivor, joined Democrats to vote against Kennedy.\\n\\nEarlier this week, again alone among Republicans. McConnell voted against handing the American intelligence community over to Tulsi Gabbard. Previously, he voted against Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. I will grant you that McConnell cast all these votes full in the knowledge that none of his colleagues would join him and that he was never going to be the swing vote. But the fact remains that he was the only Republican to register his disapproval of turning over the nation’s intelligence to a Kremlin apologist, handing the Department of Defense to a third-string Fox News host accused of drinking on the job, and, today, entrusting the nation’s public health to an anti-vaccine loon whose kid said he beheads dead whales for fun. Compare that vote with the embarrassing performance of Senator Bill Cassidy, an actual physician, who talked big about being concerned about Robert Kennedy Jr. but is up for reelection the next time around, and whose conversion on the nominee was treated as pivotal, as though any other Republicans would have followed him. From The Washington Post:\\n\\nAs many of his colleagues have swallowed their concerns about these nominees’ backgrounds or policy positions, McConnell has silently and with little fanfare voted against them—refusing to even meet with the candidates one on one before doing so. “The Senate’s power of advice and consent is not an option; it is an obligation, and one we cannot pretend to misunderstand,” McConnell said in his statement Wednesday. “When a nominee’s record proves them unworthy of the highest public trust, and when their command of relevant policy falls short of the requirements of their office, the Senate should withhold its consent.”\\n\\nThis coming from the guy who gamed the “advise and consent” power to screw Merrick Garland and gift us all with Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett—and with the carefully manufactured Supreme Court majority that has overturned Roe v. Wade, demolished the Chevron Doctrine, and granted the current president immunity for all his offenses the last time he was president—is positively head-spinning. Frankly, it’s fairly easily mocked. But given some other news of the day, I’m disinclined to laugh too loudly. From The New York Times:\\n\\nA worsening measles outbreak has taken root in Texas, sickening two dozen and hospitalizing nine on the western edge of the state, where childhood vaccination rates have dwindled in recent years.... “There’s a feeling this is going to be more and more common,” said Dr. Cameron Wolfe, an infectious disease expert at Duke University. The Texas outbreak has so far been limited to residents of Gaines County, which borders New Mexico and has roughly 20,000 residents. Last year 82 percent of kindergarten students received the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, according to state data. That figure is roughly 10 percentage points lower than the average vaccination rate in Texas public schools and far below the federal target of 95 percent for measles vaccination.\\n\\nMitch McConnell is a polio survivor, like my mother was. I remember how happy she was when the Salk vaccine was produced. She practically carried me to the pediatrician’s office for my shot, and due to her time in an iron lung, she was a lifetime medicophobe. But she knew what a breakthrough was, and so does Senator McConnell.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu, was quite a fellow. He was a judge. He was also a writer, an economist, a scientist, a historian, and a philosopher. He was one of the first to associate climate with the economics of nature. (France, you will not be surprised, was his ideal match of climate and economy.) In 1748, writing anonymously, he published a book called The Spirit of Laws. The book was a revelation, especially to young politicians in Great Britain and its American colonies. The Vatican was less enthusiastic; it put it on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, a list that much later did not include, among other works, Mein Kampf.\\n\\nIn The Spirit of Laws, CLdS, BdLBedM (What is with these French names? Did they all carry business cards the size of road maps?), posits the theory of the separation of powers as a necessary construct for the preservation of liberty, an idea that John Locke first had proposed in its rudimentary form. Montesquieu wrote:\\n\\nWhen in the same person or in the same body of magistracy the legislative authority is combined with the executive authority, there is no freedom, because one can fear lest the same monarch or the same senate make tyrannical laws in order to carry them out tyrannically. Again there is no freedom if the authority to judge is not separated from the legislative and executive authorities. If it were combined with the legislative authority, power over the life and liberty of the citizens would be arbitrary, for the judge would be the legislator. If it were combined with the executive authority, the judge could have the strength of an oppressor. All would be lost if the same man or the same body of principals, or of nobles, or of the people, exercised these three powers: that of making laws, that of executing public resolutions, and that of judging crimes or disputes between individuals.\\n\\nThis idea percolated vigorously in the mind of a rising Virginia politician named James Madison, who set about the task of designing a government for the United States that would not fall apart like an overcooked chicken the way the Articles of Confederation had. In Federalist 51, Madison’s debt to this long-dead philosophe is plain.\\n\\nBut the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department, consists in giving to those who administer each department, the necessary constitutional means, and personal motives, to resist encroachments of the others.… Ambition must be made to counteract ambition. The interest of the man, must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place. It may be a reflection on human nature, that such devices should be necessary to control the abuses of government.\\n\\nMadison set up an endless, but discreet, brawl between gentlemen. One institution would exist in tension with the other two, and each one would jealously guard its prerogatives. The experiment would work best if Congress reined in the executive, and the executive was the last safeguard against a legislature gone mad. (Like, for example, the current monkey-house presided over by Speaker Mike Johnson.) And the judiciary would keep an eye on both of them to make sure that the liberties of the people were not bargained away for some temporary political advantage. The Constitution is written as a set of boundaries for political conflict, a compendium of rules for fighting as surely as that set down by the Marquess of Queensbury.\\n\\nIt is not an exaggeration to say that those rules, and the system that was designed to operate according to them, is in the process of complete collapse.\\n\\nIn Master of the Senate, the third volume of his monumental biography of Lyndon B. Johnson, Robert Caro provides some acerbic commentary on that august body. “Decades of the seniority rule had conferred influence in the Senate not on men who broke new ground but on men who were careful not to,” he wrote. “It wasn’t outside forces that kept the Senate inefficient.… It was the Senate itself.”\\n\\nCaro explains vividly how Senate majority leader LBJ shook that institution out of its lethargy, especially on the issue of civil rights. In doing so, he brought the Senate back to its proper method of operation. Yes, it is supposed to be the thoughtful check on the wild kingdom of the House, but it is not supposed to be the place where legislation goes to die of neglect. It must assert its power and not run from it.\\n\\nRight now, separation of powers is in an appalling place. The executive is run by a dotty old autocrat who is populating his administration with slavish devotees, a madman begetting more madmen, as Starbuck cries into the storm battering the Pequod. The legislature has rubber-stamped dreadful Cabinet employees. And the Supreme Court has abandoned its own precedents hand over fist. I have lived through the imperial presidency days, but this is something worse. Both the Congress and the court have lost the stomach to fight for their own constitutional prerogatives. The old saw about how liberals are people who won’t take their own side in an argument applies even more to the current Congress and the current Supreme Court.\\n\\nThe pivot point, for me, anyway, came on February 13, 2021. On that day, the Senate voted to convict Donald Trump on charges that he’d incited the insurrection of a month earlier. But the vote was 57–43, short of the two thirds necessary to prevent him by law from running for federal office ever again. Trump was already out of office. There was absolutely nothing he could do to the Republicans whose lives he’d endangered on January 6, 2021. But Mitch McConnell declined to whip Republican votes for the impeachment resolution. And his statement on the floor of the Senate after the resolution passed is a masterpiece of pettifoggery, evasion, and the kind of surrender that diminishes the Senate as an independent institution.\\n\\nMcConnell spent several minutes excoriating Trump and, yes, fixing the blame for the insurrection squarely upon him:\\n\\nA mob was assaulting the Capitol in his name. These criminals were carrying his banners, hanging his flags, and screaming their loyalty to him. It was obvious that only President Trump could end this. Former aides publicly begged him to do so. Loyal allies frantically called the administration. But the President did not act swiftly. He did not do his job. He didn’t take steps so federal law could be faithfully executed and order restored. Instead, according to public reports, he watched television happily as the chaos unfolded. He kept pressing his scheme to overturn the election!\\n\\nEven after it was clear to any reasonable observer that Vice President Pence was in danger … even as the mob carrying Trump banners was beating cops and breaching perimeters … the president sent a further tweet attacking his vice president. Predictably and foreseeably under the circumstances, members of the mob seemed to interpret this as further inspiration to lawlessness and violence.\\n\\nLater, even when the president did half-heartedly begin calling for peace, he did not call right away for the riot to end. He did not tell the mob to depart until even later. And even then, with police officers bleeding and broken glass covering Capitol floors, he kept repeating election lies and praising the criminals. In recent weeks, our ex-president’s associates have tried to use the 74 million Americans who voted to reelect him as a kind of human shield against criticism. Anyone who decries his awful behavior is accused of insulting millions of voters. That is an absurd deflection. Seventy-four million Americans did not invade the Capitol. Several hundred rioters did. And 74 million Americans did not engineer the campaign of disinformation and rage that provoked it. One person did. I have made my view of this episode very plain.\\n\\nWhat followed was a “But…” that you could hear in the Yukon.\\n\\nBut our system of government gave the Senate a specific task. The Constitution gives us a particular role. This body is not invited to act as the nation’s overarching moral tribunal. We are not free to work backward from whether the accused party might personally deserve some kind of punishment.… If President Trump were still in office, I would have carefully considered whether the House managers proved their specific charge. By the strict criminal standard, the president’s speech probably was not incitement. However, in the context of impeachment, the Senate might have decided this was acceptable shorthand for the reckless actions that preceded the riot. But in this case, that question is moot. Because former president Trump is constitutionally not eligible for conviction.\\n\\nThere is no doubt this is a very close question. Donald Trump was the president when the House voted, though not when the House chose to deliver the papers. Brilliant scholars argue both sides of the jurisdictional question. The text is legitimately ambiguous. I respect my colleagues who have reached either conclusion. But after intense reflection, I believe the best constitutional reading shows that Article II, Section 4 exhausts the set of persons who can legitimately be impeached, tried, or convicted. The president, vice president, and civil officers. We have no power to convict and disqualify a former officeholder who is now a private citizen.\\n\\nThis pious dereliction is made even funnier in light of the decision of the Supreme Court conferring immunity on former presidents for crimes they may have committed in office. It has been a long, slow slide toward the current catastrophe, and nobody who was in a position to stop it cared even to try. Part of this collapse is due to careerism, but most of it can be attributed to fear. Vanity Fair ran a report this week that cited anonymous Congress-critters declaring themselves “scared shitless” to oppose nominees and policies they clearly know are wrongheaded and dangerous because of threats of actual physical violence from the president’s supporters. Which, believe it or not, brings us back to old Montesquieu again. In The Spirit of Law, he mused on the classification of political systems based on what he called an operating “principle” underlying each of them. For example, he wrote the principle underlying democratic republic is virtue, and the principle underlying monarchies is the love of honor. For despotisms, however, the underlying principle is fear. ’Twas ever thus.\\n\\nThis column originally ran in the weekly “Last Call with Charles P. Pierce” newsletter. Sign up here.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Well, this seemed particularly well-timed. The world—not to mention Delta flights to Toronto—has turned upside down. From CNN:\\n\\nAn exact number of firings is not yet known, but the head of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, AFL-CIO, said that “several hundred” workers started getting firing notices on Friday—and that they could even be barred from FAA facilities Tuesday after the federal holiday. CNN has reached out to the FAA for comment.\\n\\nOne of the many troublesome results of the members of the DOGE body declaring the Red Hour in the bureaucracy is the clear-cutting of probationary workers throughout the executive branch. The probationary workers are easier targets of opportunity, having fewer protections under current regulations. From CBS News:\\n\\nThe decision on probationary workers, who generally have less than a year on the job, came from the Office of Personnel Management, which serves as a human resources department for the federal government. The notification was confirmed by a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.\\n\\nEven workers in the personnel office itself were not immune: Dozens of probationary employees at OPM were told on a Thursday afternoon group call that they were being dismissed and then instructed to leave the building within a half-hour, according to another person who likewise spoke on condition of anonymity.\\n\\nSo many of the people being peremptorily—and, in many cases, insultingly—fired are young people still anxious to make careers in public service. Social media is replete these days with victims of the purge who explain that they have lost the jobs they have wanted to have for their entire lives. Among other things, this means that if we ever come out of this excursion into Bedlam, which is no sure thing, it’s going to take years to train another generation of federal workers—years to train new FAA personnel, years to train new personnel for the Forest Services, years to train new meat inspectors, years to train new nuclear inspectors. ProPublica ran a report about the effects of these firings on wildfire safety.\\n\\nProPublica spoke to a dozen firefighters and others who assist with the federal wildfire response across the country and across agencies. They described a range of immediate impacts on a workforce that was already stressed by budgetary woes predating the Trump administration. Hiring of some seasonal workers has stalled. Money for partner nonprofits that assist with fuel-reduction projects has been frozen. And crews that had traveled to support prescribed burns in Florida were turned back, while those assisting with wildfire cleanup in California faced confusion over how long they would be allowed to do that work.\\n\\nA national firefighting leadership training program that McLane was set to attend was canceled on short notice, he said. McLane acknowledged that federal firefighting agencies need a major overhaul, noting that his crew was downsized 30% by pre-Trump administration cuts. But the current confusion could further impact public safety because of the lack of clear leadership and the disrupted preparations for wildfire season. “Wildfire doesn’t care about our bureaucratic calendar,” McLane said.\\n\\nRegardless of right-wing mythology, these people are not loafers leaning on their shovels eight hours a day. Most of them are trained professionals doing hard, and occasionally dangerous, work. Many of them are underpaid and overworked. And now they’re beset by a plague of undertrained postadolescents in cargo shorts who don’t know what nuclear safety inspectors do, or that the title of a report containing the word gender really was mostly a study of trees in Brazil, or that there aren’t actually 150-year old people collecting Social Security.\\n\\n“Close enough for government work,” didn’t used to be this much of a joke.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'At the First Baptist Church of Phenix City, Alabama, the last Sunday of October 2023 was Pastor Appreciation Day. The church was festive, the service well attended. There was strawberry cake, Pastor Copeland’s favorite, and special music in his honor by two of his closest friends, who sang a program of Baptist hymns, accompanying themselves on piano. Bernard Vann, the church’s elder statesman, spoke from the pulpit on behalf of the congregation, testifying as to how blessed they all felt that Bubba Copeland had entered their lives and bestowed his gifts, bound them together as a spiritual community. After reading a very long list of duties that make up a churchman’s life, Vann ribbed Bubba that he sure was getting a lot of attention that day for a job that’s just “one day a week.” Then he turned to Bubba and said, “We as a church love you, and we appreciate you for everything you’ve done,” with the true feeling of an old man, as he embraced his pastor.\\n\\nOnce Vann took his seat, Bubba stepped up to the pulpit. “I am so undeserving,” he said. “I don’t come from a background of being a pastor. I come from a background of loving people. And I believe there’s a giant difference between being a Christian and being Christlike. I try my best to be Christlike. There’s a lot of Christians that hurt people. What we should strive to do is go out of our way to love people unconditionally, despite who they are, what they are—because you know why? Jesus loves me.”\\n\\nBubba would often talk about how his life had been suffused with a grace that was beyond his comprehension. He believed that was the essence of God, and today he was telling his congregation that if God could love him—of all people—it was a sure sign that God loved everyone created in His image.\\n\\nThat last Sunday of October 2023 would be the last Sunday of Bubba Copeland’s life.\\n\\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Copeland was forty-nine and the mayor of his hometown. In his corner of the world, he was needed, and he loved being needed.\\n\\nWe all have things that we don’t want other people to know about us. Things that might be hard to explain, even to ourselves. The world can be an unforgiving place, quick to judge, and friendships can be fleeting. Would the people whose regard means the most to us look at us differently if they learned of our hidden selves? Would they abandon us? Surely God knows our secrets. What does He think of us?\\n\\nThis is a story about just that—what God thinks. It’s also a story of identity and exposure, of revenge and public humiliation. Of deep love and senseless loss, and the unending grief of a small town.\\n\\nAnd secrets. It is a story about secrets.\\n\\nBubba Copeland had many secrets. And as a servant to both God and man, the judgments of heaven and earth were the alpha and omega of Bubba’s existence. What God thinks of anything, much less any of us, is difficult to discern, if we are honest. But the people of the First Baptist Church of Phenix City, Alabama, unabashedly adored Bubba.\\n\\nHe was empathetic and industrious and always seemed to be doing something for somebody. By last fall, he had been the senior pastor at First Baptist for four years and the church’s youth minister for fifteen years before that. Bubba was not seminary trained and was not what you might call an intellectual from the pulpit, but what he lacked in academic theology he made up for in his eagerness to answer to the spiritual and material needs of others, no matter the time or expense. According to the people in his church family who knew him best and loved him most, Bubba possessed an enormous capacity to serve, and his sermons were personal, compassionate, and often funny. As a Christian and as a pastor, he thought that in a pinch the Sermon on the Mount was just about all the Bible a man would ever need, and his favorite verse was Matthew 7:1—“Judge not, that ye be not judged.” All he knew about the ministry he had learned by the side of his first father-in-law, Dr. Eugene Langner, who pastored to the souls of the congregation at First Baptist Church for thirty years until his death in 2013. Even after Bubba and Merrigail, Langner’s daughter, got divorced, the two men maintained a loving friendship. Bubba and Merrigail had given Langner a grandson, after all. Young Carter Copeland would grow up underfoot at the church, singing hymns from the pulpit with a poise that would make his father cry. Grandfather, father, and son remained exceptionally close, their relationships unburdened by the strain that often comes with divorce.\\n\\nBy the last Sunday of October 2023, not only were Bubba and his second wife, Angela, and his two stepdaughters the first family of First Baptist Church, but the Copelands were also the first family of nearby Smiths Station, Bubba’s hometown, where he was finishing his second term as mayor. He was renowned for bringing a Love’s truck stop to the main highway through town, a feat of economic development that most mayors of towns the size of Smiths Station (population: 5,470) can only dream of—to hear the awe with which the people there talk about that truck stop, you’d think Bubba had brought IBM to town. When a tornado struck Smiths Station in 2019, killing twenty-three East Alabamians in the neighboring community of Beauregard, he was a twenty-four-hour one-man rescue crew—removing debris, providing supplies and reliable information to his people, and offering hugs when nothing else would do. That same year, when a high school senior in Smiths Station named Lexi Webb took her own life, Bubba initiated #SSNotOneMore, a suicide-prevention campaign. On the night before school started, without telling anyone they were doing it, Bubba and a group of volunteers scattered hundreds of signs all over town: YOU ARE WORTHY OF LOVE. YOUR MISTAKES DO NOT DEFINE YOU. YOU MATTER. DON’T GIVE UP. He had Post-it notes printed with the same affirmations and had volunteers pass them out at all the schools.\\n\\nIn his spare time, Bubba also owned and operated the Country Market over in Salem, where he had a reputation for employing local folks who might have trouble finding work elsewhere. His social-media feed was always full of cheerful posts about the latest specials on pork butts and paper towels. Life was good, if maybe a bit hectic.\\n\\nIn his corner of the world, Bubba Copeland was needed, and he loved being needed.\\n\\nDavid White, a retired doctor and chairman of the First Baptist Church board of trustees, was always urging Bubba to take a break, get out of town with Angela and the girls on vacation, disconnect for a while. “My only concern for Bubba was that he was spread too thin,” White says. “But his idea of a vacation was thinking up new outreach programs for the church.”\\n\\nThe Reverend Ralph Wooten, who for several years was pastor of the First United Methodist Church in Phenix City, says he first saw Bubba “emerging from a cloud of barbecue smoke” at the First Baptist annual cookout, and the two men became dear friends. “Bubba was a father of a blended family. He was a husband. He was a pastor. He was a successful small-business owner. And he was the mayor of a town that he loved,” says Wooten. “Any one of those things is enough for one human being, and yet he was all of those things. I knew it was a lot and encouraged him to take care of himself. He seemed to be taking it all in stride.”\\n\\nAndrew Hetherington Carter Copeland, Bubba’s son, is a student at Auburn and was asleep when the story about his father broke. He awoke to a text from his best friend: “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what to say.”\\n\\nDaniel Windsor, a dentist in Phenix City and a longtime member of Bubba’s church, says that Bubba was a “five-finger friend”—that is, he was one of a small group of cherished people in Windsor’s life so vital that you can count them on one hand. “He was an indispensable friend—and I loved him dearly,” Windsor says.\\n\\nJay Jones, the sheriff of Lee County, Alabama, says that “Bubba was hard not to like. He was that selfless and that reliable, the sort of person who rushes toward need, no questions asked. There aren’t that many people like Bubba in this world.”\\n\\nThe sign on the lawn in front of Bubba’s church read ALL ARE WELCOME. And all were welcome. For Bubba, that was how God worked in people. You might call it the essence of the Copeland theology. “Ain’t God good?” he would say to friends and strangers alike. And with Bubba, you were never a stranger for long.\\n\\nDan Elkins became a member of First Baptist Church in 2018. He was himself a Baptist minister and for ten years had successfully tended his own flock in an “itty-bitty” town in southern Alabama. Married with two kids, Elkins had tried to make his marriage work even though he had known for years that he was gay. After he and his wife divorced in 2003, he resettled in Phenix City, where he would meet his husband, Jason Price. Their first date was at the Home Depot. “In case it didn’t work out, you always need something at Home Depot, right?” Price says with a laugh.\\n\\nBoth Elkins and Price have a deep faith and struggled to find a church that would be a true spiritual home for them, where they would be welcomed as full-fledged members, not “as lesser than.” “There’s churches that will cash our checks and let me and my husband sit in the back pew, but we didn’t want that. We feel that we have a lot to give and love being involved in a vibrant community,” Elkins says. They had heard good things about First Baptist in Phenix City, but Price had serious reservations about committing to a Baptist church. “I thought, I ain’t going to no Southern Baptist church,” he says. “Been there, done that.”\\n\\nElkins first wanted to talk to the pastor, have a frank conversation, and manage everyone’s expectations from the start. Elkins called the mayor’s office in Smiths Station, and Bubba said to come on by. “We sat there across from each other, and I told him that Jason and I wanted to be members of a church where we would be treated with dignity and respect and welcomed without reservation.” Instantly, Bubba responded, “Dan, you are my brother. God has blessed our church by sending you to join us.” Bubba added that his son was gay and that he was “not sure how to relate to him. God has brought you into my life to be Carter’s gay stepdad.”\\n\\n“So we joined First Baptist and never looked back,” Elkins says. “It’s hard for me to express the depth of my gratitude for what Bubba gave us.”\\n\\nIt’s not that Bubba’s friends idealized him or thought he was perfect—they didn’t, and he wasn’t. For one, he had to keep a laminate of the Lord’s Prayer in a right-hand corner of the pulpit at First Baptist, as he sometimes forgot the words. A bigger problem for Bubba was that he worried too much about what people thought of him. And he spent way too much time looking at his phone. These days, of course, there is a direct correlation between those two things. Bubba felt an unending sense of responsibility to the people of his church family and to the people of Smiths Station. An unkind comment on Facebook could keep him up at night. If this is a common modern affliction, Bubba had an acute case.\\n\\nIt would be his undoing.\\n\\nAt the end of the Pastor Appreciation Day service, Bubba joined Dan Elkins and Daniel Windsor at the piano on the altar to sing a favorite song. The Lord did not bless Bubba with much of a singing voice, but what he lacked in talent he made up for in effort. The song was “Sweet Beulah Land,” and the second verse goes like this:\\n\\nI’m looking now, just across the river\\n\\nTo where my faith shall end in sight\\n\\nThere’s just a few more days to labor\\n\\nThen I will take my heavenly flight\\n\\nThree days later, on the morning of Wednesday, November 1, an online news site called 1819 News, which states as its mission the promotion of “Alabama values,” published a story about Bubba Copeland and all his secrets. Titled “The secret life of Smiths Station Mayor and Baptist pastor F. L. ‘Bubba’ Copeland as a ‘transgender curvy girl,’ ” the story was about Bubba’s hidden online life and featured pictures of him in makeup and a blond wig, wearing women’s underwear and clothes. He had posted the pictures to Reddit subgroups, including one called TransLater, where they would collect comments such as “Sister you look beautiful. Cute outfit,” and Bubba would reply, “Thank you doll!”\\n\\nAndrew Hetherington Dan Elkins and David White at White’s dinner table, where a somber group gathered the morning after Bubba’s death to plan the future of First Baptist Church.\\n\\nWhen the 1819 News correspondent, Craig Monger, had called for comment, Bubba had begged him not to publish the story, fearing that news of his private life exploding into public view would embarrass his family, his town, and his church. Dressing up was something he and his wife had done on a lark, he told Monger. He then went further, saying that cross-\\xaddressing was something he had done on occasion since he was a young man, a hobby to relieve stress. “I have a lot of stress,” he told Monger. “I’m not medically transitioning. It’s just a bit of a character I’m playing.”\\n\\n“The more I talked to them, the more turned around it got,” Bubba would tell a friend.\\n\\nWhen the story hit the next morning, Bubba’s son Carter, a junior at Auburn, was still asleep. He woke up to a text from his best friend that read, “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what to say. I don’t know what to do.”\\n\\n“I had no idea what she was talking about,” Carter says. “I called her, and she told me what had happened. Immediately, I looked up my dad’s name online and saw it everywhere. It was early in the morning, and every news outlet I’d never heard of had already jumped on it, like piranhas. I watched the whole world tear him down almost instantaneously.”\\n\\nCarter and his father were extremely close. Over the years, each had confided in the other about their innermost struggles—in high school, Carter had come out to his father, and Bubba had shared his secrets with his son. Carter was shocked at the meanness of the story and was overcome with a visceral fear that he had never known before. In a panic, he called his dad.\\n\\n“He picked up and said, ‘Good morning, buddy.’ And I said, ‘What are you talking about, Good morning?!’ Trying to calm me down, he again slowly said, ‘Good morning, buddy.’ And I said, ‘Okay, good morning.’ And then I said, ‘Dad, we have to talk.’ And he said, ‘No, we don’t. I need to get into a meeting. I have people I need to take care of. We’ll talk later.’ ”\\n\\nAfraid, and not knowing what else to do, Carter wrote to the story’s author, whose email address was posted on the 1819 News website. He received no response. The next day, Thursday, November 2, he wrote to him again:\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Monger,\\n\\n. . . I am Bubba Copeland’s son. What you have done is not by any means journalism. You have hurt the man who has been here for me my entire life. My father is my hero, always has been, and always will be. I have seen some awful things in this world and experienced a great deal of hatred myself as a gay man. You have fueled a fire of hatred and bigotry unlike any other I have ever seen in my life. I have over the last 24 hours watched my father completely break down. I truly wish I could express to you the emotions and the feelings I feel towards you and your colleagues, but I am unable at this time. My only wish now is that you are able to carry on with your life and have the peace which you have so heartlessly taken from countless lives by writing this article. . . . If you find time in your day to step aside from your [duties] I would greatly appreciate a call. More than anything else I would like to tell you the kind of person my father really is. You should truly be ashamed of yourself.\\n\\nBy that day, Bubba’s family, his church family, and several of his closest friends in Smiths Station had become concerned that he might harm himself. The 1819 News story was all anybody was talking about. And another story—more lurid, more humiliating, harder to explain—was on the way and would reveal the last of Bubba’s secrets to the entire world. He was in disbelief at the coverage, and the brutal anonymity of the hate pouring onto the First Baptist website and Facebook feed beggared belief.\\n\\nHypocrite!\\n\\nHAHA faggot.\\n\\nYou should kill yourself.\\n\\n\\n\\nJason Price and Dan Elkins were the administrators for the church accounts. Along with another volunteer from the church, they would stay up all night taking down the comments so that Bubba wouldn’t see them. But Bubba couldn’t sleep and was fixated on the velocity and reach of the Internet and its lacerating judgments. As the calendar turned from Thursday to Friday, the community of people who knew him best and loved him most—the people you have just met, and many more besides—desperately tried to form a bulwark between him and the ugliness of the world.\\n\\nBubba, hold your head high. You are so loved and have so much support.\\n\\nBubba, you are going to get through this—we are going to get through this, together.\\n\\nBubba, just hold on, brother—get out of town for a few days, this will blow over.\\n\\nBubba responded: These are dark days.\\n\\nSensing his growing despair, his friends and family began sending more urgent messages:\\n\\nBubba, where are the guns?\\n\\nBubba, we can’t do this without you. How are we going to live our lives without you?\\n\\nWhen the world comes at you, though, it comes at you.\\n\\nThe story had gone global, and Bubba couldn’t look away from his phone. Have you seen the New York Daily News? he would ask friends, obsessing over the latest headline.\\n\\nThis article appeared in the April/May 2024 issue of Esquire\\n\\nsubscribe\\n\\nElizabeth White, a WRBL News 3 crime reporter based in Auburn, Alabama, who reported on Bubba in his capacity as mayor of Smiths Station, says that “Bubba was down, and they just kept kicking and kicking and kicking. It wasn’t enough for them to just expose him. They wanted to hurt him. It’s devastating to know that for all the good he did, he spent his last days and moments in unbearable anguish.”\\n\\nOn the afternoon of Friday, November 3, feeling all but destroyed, Bubba Copeland finished the job and killed himself.\\n\\nThe Lee County coroner, Daniel Sexton, would write in his report that the cause of death was a .38 slug to the right side of Bubba’s head, just above the ear. But no clinical description of what a handgun can do to flesh and bone will ever capture the true cause of Bubba Copeland’s death.\\n\\nThe next morning, Bubba’s son again wrote to Craig Monger:\\n\\nI hope if you ever have children, they never have to face what I am now going through. I hope that they never have to find out that their father caused another man’s death by his own hand. You and your colleagues took my father from me. . . . I hope the Lord’s judgment for you is swift and deliberate.\\n\\nCarter Copeland is still waiting for a reply.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen a stranger comes to a small town asking painful questions of a grieving community, the third degree is not only understandable, it’s to be expected.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You like coffee?” David White asks me. “Well, if you’re in Phenix City anyway, then I guess you should come by so we can look each other in the eye and size each other up.”\\n\\nThe doctor and his wife, Lori, live across the street from First Baptist Church. He is quick to point out that on Easter Sunday in 1865, Union general James H. Wilson began one of the last battles of the Civil War from his yard, staging his attack on Confederate fortifications across the Chattahoochee River in Columbus, Georgia, before going on to capture Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy. White is bemused at his proximity to this history. In fact, he seems to wear a bemused expression as his face’s default setting. The staging area used by Wilson’s Raiders is now used to stage White’s beehives; his family’s annual “canning kitchen,” in which they put up thousands of jars of fruit preserves and jellies and pickles to give away to friends and strangers far and wide at Christmas; his own small vineyard, where he cultivates grapes for a wine that’s “best served in Dixie cups”; and the pits for the church barbecue on the last Saturday in April, where they’ll smoke two thousand pounds of pork.\\n\\nCourtesy of family Bubba would describe his cross-dressing as “a hobby I do to relieve stress.”\\n\\nWhite is from Phenix City, fifth generation, and grew up in this house, which was built in 1906. During the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, as there were no hospitals, the house was made into a flu infirmary, with the sick and dying in the front and concerned family members coming and going from the back, the two halves separated by a heavy curtain that no one was allowed to cross except for the nurse. The doctor would come once a day to leave morphine and aspirin, pronounce the dead, and figure out where to put the new arrivals. “There’s a Black community a quarter mile that way,” White says. “We all grew up together. That’s the way it was. And in those days, nobody had anything, so there was no economic distinction between neighbors. It wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t good, but it was a lot of people striving together to get by. It wasn’t all Ku Klux Klan.”\\n\\nPer the census, Phenix City has a population of thirty-eight thousand, spread out along the Chattahoochee River, straddling Lee and Russell counties. But it has the feeling of a smaller town, essentially a modest suburb of Columbus, Georgia, directly across the river. Roughly half Black and half white, the diverse population is reflected in First Baptist’s congregation.\\n\\nWhite’s father was born in this house in 1917 and was a newborn when both of his parents became gravely ill with the flu. The nurse was caring for White’s grandparents, who were laid out in the front of the house, and the baby was quarantined on the back porch. The need was so great, and the nurse was doing the best she could, but at one stretch she forgot about the newborn and went forty hours straight without crossing the curtain. When she realized what she’d done, she just knew that the baby was dead. She rushed through the curtain to the rear of the house only to find a six-year-old Black boy named Roy Pierson—who had sick family in the front of the house, too, and had himself been lost in the shuffle—caring for the baby, who was quite alive. “Roy was not big enough to pick him up. So he would sleep under the cradle and rock him, and he did his best to keep him clean, but he couldn’t figure out how to feed him. So he would get food and he would chew it up, and he would take it from his mouth and put it into my father’s mouth,” White says. “So when I came along in the South in the early sixties, my Uncle Roy was a Black man. He was my father’s brother, as much of a brother as my father would ever have, and they could not have been any closer had they been related by blood. That’s kind of the weave of the history here.”\\n\\nHe is wearing that bemused expression, but just the night before, White had been on the phone for half an hour, sternly interrogating me about why I had come to Phenix City. “We are hurting, our friend is gone, and we don’t need more salaciousness and scandal,” he said. “The press—so-called—did this to Bubba. Why would we talk to the press? People are concerned.”\\n\\nHe pours the coffee and says, “The people you are here to meet are still in shock at what happened and feel a profound sense of failure at not being able to save our friend. But if we are talking to you, it’s because we don’t want 1819 News to be the last word on Bubba Copeland.”\\n\\nThe people who exposed Bubba’s secrets said they presumed several things about him, chiefly that he was a hypocrite, preaching hate publicly for the life that he led privately. Bryan Dawson, the founder of 1819 News, would say publicly the week after Bubba’s suicide that Copeland was “pretending to be one thing—uber-conservative, Baptist, Trump, Christian, all of that”—while living a life that made a lie of those claims. Maybe Dawson was making broad assumptions about what it means to be a Baptist preacher in Alabama, but if he and his editorial team had known more about Bubba Copeland, they would have known that that assertion was far from accurate. Dawson would also admit that not only had he never heard of Bubba Copeland before receiving “a tip” about his online life, he had also never heard of Smiths Station.\\n\\nThe story of the Internet is of tribes hurling rocks over the horizon at targets they cannot see, doing damage that they do not care to measure. In this case, those assumptions and that ignorance would make Bubba less a human being than an ideological target in a raging culture war, and the damage radiating through these towns is now plain for all with eyes to see. And it’s not just these towns. Coinciding with the breakdown of our social order and abetted by technology of astonishing power, we find ourselves in a conflict over rapidly changing conceptions of gender and sexual difference. In the backlash to this upheaval, the casualties are mounting.\\n\\nTo learn about Bubba, who he actually was and what he cared about, it’s important to meet his church family, and the best place to do that is here, at David White’s dinner table. Here is where so many people have broken bread and laughed and carried on. Here is also where the trustees and deacons held an emergency meeting the Saturday morning after Bubba died to figure out if and how the church would continue. Lori White made biscuits and coffee, and a somber group sat around this table to plan the next day’s service, which is about all they had in them to do. One service at a time. Get through Sunday, then give some thought to the funeral.\\n\\nIt was decided White would lead the service the next day. He is an easy public speaker with a deep familiarity with scripture, and it was not unusual for him to offer a sermon. Bubba was eager to share his pulpit with speakers he saw as more talented than himself, and White had already been scheduled to do the talk that Sunday. But his sermon would need to be very different now. From there, he and Dan Elkins would share pastoral duties, and other area clergy—even including a Methodist pastor named Laura Eason—would be invited in to help keep the church going.\\n\\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON The evening of November 1, after the 1819 News story had broken, Bubba led his last Bible study at First Baptist. He chose a fateful passage to teach: Psalm 23:1-6, which had him walking through the valley of the shadow of death.\\n\\nTo keep going is the point of a church. Just as White and his family are fed at this table, so too are they fed at the church across the way. The need for spiritual sustenance doesn’t explain why we believe what we believe, but the two are intimately related, as with common purpose comes community. Coming together in awe and doubt in the face of eternity might be the last human feeling that AI can’t take from us. If a religion splits over a breach in heavenly doctrine or earthly politics or a combination of the two—as the Baptist church did in 1845, cleaved down the middle due to the belief held by what would become Southern Baptists that slavery was an “institution of heaven”—then the community splits, too, profoundly and perhaps irrevocably. The Southern Baptists are no longer confined to the South and now have churches in forty-one states, which makes them the largest Protestant denomination in the United States. In 1995, church leaders apologized for the faith’s racist origins and at the same time repented for the church’s opposition to the civil-rights movement and interracial marriage.\\n\\nThere have been other fault lines more recently, involving the enduring Old Testament penchant of more-conservative Christians to take it upon themselves to cast people into hell, as well as contemporary social issues—whether women can preside over services (an emphatic no in Southern Baptist churches) and whether God loves gay people (the Southern Baptist position might best be described as “hate the sin, love the sinner”).\\n\\nWhat they all seem to agree on is that the Bible is a well-worn daily instruction manual and not some ancient relic. It is important to White that I understand the First Baptist ethos and the mark that Bubba left on the church in Phenix City.\\n\\n“Our philosophy is this: We open those doors,” he says. “You can read your whole Bible, and nowhere in it does the Bible give you permission to judge your fellow man. But time after time after time, it tells you to love your fellow man. No matter what. That was Bubba’s attitude. It’s the attitude our church shares.”\\n\\nIt seems an uncontroversial point and a handy distillation of the foremost of the Christian commandments, familiar to anyone with a passing knowledge of the New Testament. All of the gospels enunciate a version of this basic tenet of Christianity, and the Gospel of Mark makes clear that there is “no commandment greater” than to love God and to “love your neighbor as yourself.”\\n\\n“It’s not that complicated,” says White, “although because we are human, we keep pretending not to understand how this is supposed to work. We keep pretending that God intended for us to rough each other up using his Word. Buddy, there but for the grace of God go I. Maybe we don’t cross-dress and that kind of stuff, but we all have our faults, and none of us deserve the harsh judgment of other flawed humans. First and foremost, Bubba Copeland was my friend. I don’t fully understand what was going on with him, in his life and in his home, but I also don’t know that I’m supposed to. I don’t think it’s my business.”\\n\\nThe evening of November 1, after the 1819 News story had broken, Bubba led his last Bible study at First Baptist. He chose a fateful passage to teach: Psalm 23:1–6, which had him walking through the valley of the shadow of death. After the session, he walked into a very tense meeting of the church’s board of trustees that began in anger and ended two hours later in tears and hugs. The trustees, led by White, had, like everyone else, been blindsided by the story and just wanted to know one thing: Bubba, is it true?\\n\\nHe maketh me to lie down in green pastures . . .\\n\\nYes, the pictures were real, he told them. They were private and never meant to be public. It was dumb to post them on the Internet. He was abjectly sorry for the embarrassment he would cause, adding that he would never purposely do anything to hurt the church or his friends.\\n\\nHe restoreth my soul . . .\\n\\n“We did not suspend him. We did not reprimand him. We did not fire him,” White says. “We talked to him frankly. We expressed our shock and disappointment, and then we replaced that with our concern and our love and our support for our brother, who was suffering. The church would be fine. Now it was Bubba we were worried about.”\\n\\nI will fear no evil, for thou art with me . . .\\n\\nThe next morning, one of the trustees from First Baptist who had been in the meeting the night before received a call from a man from the Russell County Baptist Association. The caller wanted to know what First Baptist planned to do to punish its pastor and why it hadn’t done so already.\\n\\nThou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies . . .\\n\\nThe First Baptist trustee told the caller from the Baptist Association that as First Baptist had not been aligned with the Southern Baptist Convention for decades, the situation with Bubba Copeland was none of the association’s business.\\n\\nThou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over . . .\\n\\nThe trustee added that just as the New Testament instructs in the books of Matthew, Luke, and Galatians, when a brother goes astray, as Paul wrote in his letter to the early Christians of Galatia, “you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness.”\\n\\nSurely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.\\n\\nMatthew emphasizes that this counseling should be done privately; Luke, the importance of forgiveness after repentance. And that, the trustee told the caller, was how First Baptist planned to address the situation with its brother Bubba Copeland. Thank you for calling.\\n\\nAndrew Hetherington Phenix City is roughly half Black and half white, and the town’s diversity is reflected in the First Baptist congregation. “Our philosophy is this: We open those doors,” says David White. “You can read your whole Bible, and nowhere in it does the Bible give you permission to judge your fellow man.”\\n\\n“We haven’t been Southern Baptist for twenty years,” White says. “And you’re probably not going to find another Baptist church in a small town anywhere that has gay couples that come to church every Sunday. Of course, you have to be sensitive, because we have members that are old-school, in their eighties and nineties, and they might not be ready for all of that, but they’re accepting. After Gene Langner died, we started looking for a pastor. I was on the search committee that brought the next pastor here, and we had people in church that were gay. It was generally known but not discussed. And the older members, some of them—the staunchest, most Republican, redneck guys, I mean—I grew up around them and I watched God change them, but they’re still very conservative. And more than one of them came up to me and said, You’re looking for a pastor, but, you know, so-and-so sits over there in the third row. They’re kind of different. Don’t you bring anybody here that’ll hurt them or turn them away.”\\n\\nThe Southern Baptist Convention still regards sexual difference as an abomination against God, and even homosexual desire not acted on is “always sinful, impure, degrading, shameful, unnatural, indecent and perverted,” according to the denomination’s “Resolution on Homosexual Marriage.” As a remedy for impure thoughts, the SBC endorses sexual reorientation.\\n\\nWhen Dan Elkins had his country church in southern Alabama and was struggling to reconcile his ministry with his sexuality, he came out to his then wife. That was 1996, and it would be seven years before they would divorce. “We did counseling, and I was told, You can beat this with prayer and fasting, and I prayed, and I fasted, for years—ever the good little Baptist boy—but I was earnestly trying to change something that simply can’t be changed,” Elkins says. “I had come out to a confidant at church, and that person betrayed my trust and it got out in the community, but I didn’t know it. We showed up for church one Wednesday night and the parking lot was full, and I’m like, Something’s going on. This was January 2002. Oh my word. If Facebook had been around then, I’m not sure I’d be here. I’m not sure that I would have seen the way out. Like Bubba couldn’t see the way out.”\\n\\nIn this pocket of East Alabama, though, the church doors are open, and the Bibles say that God loves everybody. “That’s how this church has evolved,” says White. “We have members who are gay and married and accepted, and that’s relatively new. And we have older members who are accepting even if they don’t understand. It’s been a long trip for them. You cannot fail to recognize how far they’ve come.\\n\\n“And that’s Bubba’s legacy,” White adds. “I can tell you that his legacy is not defined by that week. His legacy is defined by the friends he leaves, by the people that he led to the Lord, by the life and values he lived. That’s his legacy. Not 1819 News. 1819 News is to journalism what a quack is to the practice of medicine.”\\n\\nBryan Dawson believes in redemption narratives. Especially his own. The founder of 1819 News (so named because 1819 is the year Alabama became a state) has a compelling personal story that he has honed into a performance piece on various podcasts and pulpits across Alabama for the past several years, although he is not from the state or even the South.\\n\\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON When a high school student in Smiths Station took her own life, Bubba started a suicide-prevention campaign, putting up affirmations all over town.\\n\\nAs a young man, Dawson lived in Colorado Springs, and it’s there that his life of crime gave him the material for his story. He trafficked in weed, cocaine, and meth; was the kingpin of a “motorcycle, automobile theft ring”; and in spring 2007 beat a “snitch” over the head with a chain with a padlock at the end of it, for which he would be charged with attempted murder, among other felonies. (He would eventually plead to reduced charges and receive a sentence of sixteen years in prison.) These experiences have been memorialized numerous times in the press, in stories such as “From Breaking Bad to Redemption: The Story of Bryan Dawson” in Newsweek and in an interview on his own website titled “From Tragedy to Triumph, the CEO of 1819 News Shares His Story.”\\n\\nIn his story, he tells of a sad and lonely young man with no self-esteem raised in a broken home, who is always put in the “friend zone” by young women and who only ever feels comfortable as himself when he is high or drunk. And then he becomes a violent criminal, faces hundreds of years in prison, is extended grace and kindness over and over again by strangers and the state, finds God, and is ultimately salvaged by a community that forgives him seventy times seven (Matthew 18:21–22). In the details and framing of his story, Dawson is pleading for understanding, and his adoring interviewers give it to him; one even adds at the end, “I think if you had been born way back, you would be in the Bible.”\\n\\nYes, you might say that Dawson’s Colorado Springs redemption epic is like Saul on the road to Damascus, if Saul had attempted to murder a man with a padlock on a chain, causing “permanent disfigurement,” according to the attending physician in a police report, who added that “the victim was lucky to be alive.”\\n\\nSaul of course repents, calls himself the “foremost of sinners,” and becomes Paul, the greatest writer of the New Testament. In his redemption narrative, Dawson also becomes a different person, but when he tells his story this new person doesn’t mention the man he tried to kill, doesn’t indicate how he feels about him or whether he ever thinks about how he might be getting on with his permanent disfigurement. Instead, in his redemption story, Dawson occasionally shines a little light on his supporting cast—his wife, his mother—but mostly he finds satisfaction in the power of his own narrative. His interviewers feel the same way, and they interrupt him to say things like It’s just like in the movies!\\n\\nSARA PALCZEWSKI/OPELIKA-AUBURN NEWS/AP (COPELAND). MARK WARREN (SIGN). JULIE BENNETT/THE NEW YORK TIMES/REDUX (MEMORIAL) Left: The memorial in front of the church in the days after Bubba killed himself. Right: One of the signs with affirmations that Bubba put up around Smiths Station after a local high school student took her own life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhich brings us to his fresh start in Alabama, where he grew an apostolic beard, started to allow the slightest bit of a twang in now and then, joined a Baptist church in Wetumpka where he sometimes preached from the Old Testament and where just ten days before his life intersected with Bubba Copeland’s he delivered a sermon that revealed him to be an aspiring theocrat. Preaching from Deuteronomy and Samuel, he refers to “God’s government”; is entranced by the “rod of correction,” the “power of the sword,” and offenses against God that are “punishable by death”; warns of the consequences that will come when a church “neglects to use the sword properly”; and says things like “We’ve done a great job of rooting out the rubbish and the refuse of the Philistines in our church. We’ve done a phenomenal job” and “Right now in the state the fear of God is not before their eyes, so they just do whatever they want.”\\n\\nAppearing on a podcast this past January about the “Dangers of Progres\\xadsive Christianity,” Dawson said that “progressive Christianity comes from feminism creeping into the church” and that the one true faith had fallen victim to “soccer moms” and their tendency to be more welcoming and less judgmental. In the same broadcast, he trained particular fire on a prominent evangelical minister who had sparked controversy by advocating that churches be more supportive of the LGBTQ+ community. For this, Dawson called the minister an “apostate” and a “full-blown heretic” and then went on to improvise that the man was gay and was cheating on his wife, and to finish the point he said, “I wish there were Old Testament lightning strikes that happen to people when they blaspheme the Lord the way that he does.”\\n\\nThe Lord did not bless Bryan Dawson with a talent for public speaking, but what he lacks in fire he makes up for in brimstone. His Christianity seems somewhat unfamiliar with its namesake. In that, he is a familiar figure, older than time, and not only among Christians—a religious enforcer who knows just enough of a holy book to be dangerous. You might say that he put down his padlock, picked up his Bible, and didn’t skip a beat.\\n\\nDawson then merged his brutal version of the Christian faith with the often brutal politics of Alabama on the always brutal platform of the Internet and in late 2021 founded 1819 News to counter the most prominent news site in Alabama, AL.com, which is, he says, “communist propaganda.”\\n\\nThese details of Dawson’s story are important, because in the moral calculus of 1819 News, Bryan Dawson is allowed a redemption narrative sanitized of victims, but Bubba Copeland is not. Perhaps that is because Dawson’s violent felonies were manly crimes, just like in the movies, whereas Bubba Copeland’s transgressions were of thought and behavior that Dawson could not square with his version of the faith and would not tolerate, and rather than extend Copeland the grace that he himself had been the beneficiary of so many times, he ignored Bubba’s plea for mercy and leveled him instead. He and his editor in chief, Jeff Poor—an alum of the Daily Caller and a regular contributor to Breitbart—would make the case that it was Bubba Copeland, who did not preach violence from his pulpit, who was the dangerous one. After his death, they would assert publicly that he was a troubled man, that he had victims, that it was their duty to expose him, and that, as Poor would say, “the people at First Baptist Church, Phenix City, had a right to know what their worship leader was doing.”\\n\\nOn the day that Bubba Copeland took his own life, 1819 News published its second feature on his fantasy life online. This story was even more lurid than the first, detailing pieces of erotic fiction that Bubba had posted as his alter ego. Some of the fiction was gruesome—one story in particular dealt with a trans protagonist who stalked and killed a woman so that she could have a relationship with her victim’s husband. The story was titled “Dangerous Obsession”: “In my cubicle I scanned her page. She posted a new picture! Excited I screenshot it to add to my ever-growing collection. To say I was a stalker would be a bit of an understatement. Every post she made I studied it, analyzing and taking notes of her daily routine. What she ate, what she drank, from her favorite coffee to her favorite alcoholic drink. Her life had become my obsession.”\\n\\nIn the two days since 1819 News had posted its first story, it had been alerted that Bubba had used pictures of at least two real people from the Phenix City area in at least one of his posts—a meme about transitioning. The two were a brother and sister, and people from the community have confirmed for me that the brother was a minor when the picture that Bubba used was taken. In his second feature, correspondent Craig Monger wrote that the father of the children pictured had called 1819 News, informed the site that the pictures were of his children, and asked them to remove the images. (The photo of the boy was taken from the father’s social-media account.) In his posts, Bubba seemed to use photos from the Internet both purposefully and indiscriminately, once including an image of a teenage girl who was not from the area.\\n\\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Lisa Deason worked with Bubba in the Smiths Station mayor’s office. She engaged in a physical strug\\xadgle with him in a vain effort to keep him from ending his life.\\n\\nA local woman had contacted the site to say that Bubba had used pictures of her in some of his posts. Monger also discovered that Bubba had used the name of another local woman in “Dangerous Obsession.” I reached out to the father of the brother and sister but did not hear back, and also to both of the women. One did not reply, the other wrote back, “No need to bring all of that back up as those . . . families heal.”\\n\\nWhen Dawson and Poor had published their exposé on Bubba two days earlier, the 1819 News editorial team had apparently not been aware that he had used the names and images of people he knew in posting to his online community. But in the days after his death, his poor judgment would become their justification for having published the stories in the first place. 1819 News’s initial imperative—to expose a cross-dressing pastor that its editorial team had assumed to be a hypocrite—would no longer be enough.\\n\\nThe week after Bubba’s suicide, Dawson and Poor released a thirty-\\xadfour-minute video podcast on which they outlined all that had gone into their decision to publish their exposé. The timeline, they say, is that they received a tip about Bubba’s online life on Monday, October 30. They called him for comment. They published on Wednesday morning after deliberating for three hours the night before on whether to go through with it.\\n\\nIn the video, the two strike a sober pose. “It’s a tragic situation where no one wins,” says Dawson. They grant themselves absolution for doing the right thing and say that they feel besieged by criticism on social media that 1819 News had acted irresponsibly. Dawson does not allow himself to understand the reaction in anything other than ideological terms. “This story,” he says, “has shaken things up in the leftist community!”\\n\\nPoor wears the look of a man surprised to find himself in the middle of a matter of such consequence and bristles at the suggestion that decisions he was party to might have contributed to the death of a man. Don’t assume that Bubba Copeland killed himself because of those stories, he says. “We may never know, but don’t assume that.”\\n\\nAs they hash out their reasons, Dawson and Poor repeatedly refer to “Dangerous Obsession,” acknowledging that the story is fantasy while nonetheless treating it as if it were evidence of real conduct. Poor becomes exercised and shouts, “What if people don’t ever find out about this? What if it just is allowed to continue on into the future?” And then, with no apparent basis in fact for saying so, he adds this: “We don’t know what else is out there—don’t assume that there’s nothing else out there. This behavior does raise a lot of unanswered questions. . . . I think maybe a little caution here is warranted.”\\n\\nSix days after Bubba Copeland killed himself and his family and community had been devastated, the editor in chief of 1819 News began to urge caution while continuing to assassinate his character.\\n\\nNear the end of their podcast, Poor says that although he was “not celebrating the death of Bubba Copeland,” he was “at peace” with the decision to publish.\\n\\nIt’s easy to see that Bubba was wrong and crossed an ethical line in using the names and images of people he knew in his fiction and other posts. One can only assume that it must have been an awful experience for those two women and the father of that brother and sister to be unexpectedly swept up in this story. But in this Alabama skirmish in a hellish culture war—over gender and speech and objective reality itself—with its dehumanized politics and competing conceptions of heaven, suffused with rage and loss and bereft of much clarity, two things are clear: First, 1819 News wanted the whole world to see Bubba’s posts, without fully understanding what they contained. Before posting its stories, the editorial team there also didn’t seem to know much beyond the few facts they had discovered, things they saw as sensational and repugnant. And second, Bubba Copeland was desperate for his hidden life to remain hidden and never intended for anyone other than perhaps his wife and the other pseudonymous members of his online community to see his posts. He was shattered at the sudden collision of his private and public identities and killed himself.\\n\\nThe last story 1819 News published about Bubba Copeland came on November 11, eight days after his death. It was a short essay in support of the editorial decision to run the stories, and its conclusion was that Bubba had completed “his rejection of God’s laws” because he had “murdered himself.”\\n\\nI wrote to 1819 News four times, asking to discuss the stories it published about Bubba Copeland. I did not receive a reply.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe gave himself the nickname, as he didn’t much care for “Fred Copeland Jr.” and thought that “Bubba” sounded friendly. He was a standout linebacker for the Smiths Station high school football team, but his real passion in school had been acting in drama productions, because, as he would tell his son, “you can become someone else for a moment.”\\n\\nWhen he and his first wife, Merrigail, were dating, Bubba sat her down one night and said he had something to tell her. “Have you heard of transgender?” he asked her.\\n\\n“Bubba, I have no idea what you’re talking about,” she answered. He explained it as best he could, and then Merrigail asked, “Why are we talking about this?”\\n\\n“Well, I dabble in that,” he said. “There have been times that I have dressed up.”\\n\\nThe news threw Merrigail, but the attraction between them was so strong that she thought their relationship could withstand anything. The couple were married in 1997, and she would soon come to believe that Bubba had a compulsion that he couldn’t control. When they’d been married for a year or so, they decided to buy a dog. When the day came to pick up the dog, Bubba was working, and so Merrigail and her father, Pastor Langner, walked out to the garage to get some rope to secure a large crate. When she opened up the tool chest on Bubba’s truck, she found that it was full of women’s clothes. Merrigail turned to her father. “Dad, I don’t want to embarrass him,” she said.\\n\\n“I won’t,” her father said.\\n\\nA few years later, when she was pregnant with their son Carter, she discovered some “transgender stuff” on his computer one afternoon. When Bubba got home from work, he found Merrigail crying. He apologized profusely, saying that the stress at work was too much for him and that dressing up was an escape. “I’ll try to do better,” he told Merrigail. She knew how bad her husband’s stress was. Bubba worked with his father, who, she felt, “talked to him like he was a dog.” Fred Sr. was a hard man, a combat veteran who had returned from Vietnam and made his fortune in the grocery business in Georgia and Alabama. Bubba would often come home saying that he wanted to do something different with his life.\\n\\nMerrigail’s father told her, “Sweetheart, he can’t help it. This is who he is.” Langner would counsel his son-in-law with compassion, saying, “Bubba, Christ didn’t come into this world for us to be two people. You can only live one life. You need to decide which life you’re going to lead.”\\n\\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Mechanics\\xadville Cemetery, where Bubba would often go to meditate when he was troubled and needed to “calm down.”\\n\\nIn East Alabama, though, Bubba couldn’t imagine a world where he could be himself in a way that people would accept. The marriage broke down, and when the couple divorced in 2009, Bubba was so despondent that he seriously contemplated suicide. One morning, when Carter was eight years old, he found his father sitting on the floor in the shower, sobbing. “I said, ‘Dad, are you okay? I love you,’ ” Carter remembers. “And he said, ‘I’m okay, buddy. I just need a second.’ ” There’s a nineteenth-century cemetery—Mechanicsville Cemetery, it’s called—near the grocery store Bubba owned, and he would sometimes go there to think when he was troubled. After dropping Carter off with the babysitter, Bubba went to the cemetery, intending to kill himself. He had the barrel of a handgun in his mouth when his phone rang. It was an old friend from town, who told Bubba, “Hey, buddy. The Lord put you on my heart, and I just wanted to tell you I love you.”\\n\\nThe call stopped Bubba. But his torment would continue.\\n\\nAfter the divorce, Carter lived mostly with his father and attended the Glenwood School in Smiths Station, a private Christian academy. Bubba was a devoted father, and in the years before he met Angela, his life revolved around Carter. Two things happened in the years before Bubba remarried that would define the relationship between father and son. When he was twelve, Carter came across a digital camera in his father’s closet full of pictures of Bubba dressed in women’s clothes. “This is not something that I ever wanted you to find out,” Bubba told his son.\\n\\n“I just need to know if you’re doing something really wrong, Dad,” Carter replied.\\n\\n“Absolutely not,” Bubba answered. “This has been a hobby of mine for a while. It’s my escape.”\\n\\nWhen Merrigail found out that her son had discovered his father’s secret, she said, “Your dad is an incredible man. Don’t let this change the way that you feel about him.” It didn’t. In fact, it gave Carter the feeling that he could talk to his father about anything.\\n\\nTwo years later, when Carter was a freshman in high school, he told his father that he was gay and that he was struggling with how to live honestly at school and in the world. He wanted to be free to be himself. God had made him this way. Why would he hide who he was? His father was afraid for Carter and angry that he couldn’t talk him out of coming out publicly. He knew what would happen to him, doing so at such a young age in such a small town, and the two fought bitterly. Bubba wanted him to wait until college to come out, wanted him to go far away, be happy, live his life. Carter decided instead to come out to a cherished teacher who betrayed him to a school administrator, who called Carter into his office and told him that he was going to hell. Once the news spread, Carter experienced what felt like torture. Students would spit on him in the bathroom, throw food at him in the lunchroom, and threaten to physically attack him. The teachers were of no help, as they now hated him, too. There was no safe harbor for the gay kid at the Christian school.\\n\\nThere is nothing like being the singular locus of a compounding hatred, in a closed system that justifies the hatred and calls it good. After school one day, Carter went home, his head full of monsters, and he swallowed a bottle of pills. And then he walked into his favorite room, the family library with its cathedral ceilings, and lay on the floor and looked up and watched the ceiling fan turn. His father found him there, saw the empty pill bottle, and dragged him to the bathroom, where he put his fingers down Carter’s throat.\\n\\nIt would be the first of several suicide attempts for Carter. Time after time, his father would save him. And the last time, Bubba just held Carter and told him, “God loves you, Carter. And I love you, too. Don’t listen to those people at school. There’s nothing wrong with you. The only thing wrong with you is the judgment of the world.”\\n\\n“And then he said this: ‘Carter, if I can survive this, you can survive this, too.’ And we made a pact with each other that day that we would live. We would make ourselves happy, we would make others happy, we would live fulfilled lives. And as long as one of us had to do it, the other had to do it, too. ‘No suicides. Promise?’ ”\\n\\nCarter says now that he realizes that by coming out when he did, he was trying to show his father that it’s okay, that you can be who you are. It’s all right.\\n\\n“I had reached a point in my life where I had begun to accept myself,” he says. “I had finally gotten to that point, and now my own father had to go through it. And the people that hated me and wanted me to be morally punished were the same people that took my dad from me.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAndrew Hetherington A memorial to Bubba, which was unveiled on March 26, 2024. Part of the Smiths Station memorial sidewalk, the marker is located in front of the Historic Jones Store Museum, a local heritage project that he had championed and that opened in 2019.\\n\\nIt was the afternoon of Friday, November 3, 2023. The last hour of Bubba Copeland’s life. For days, those who knew him best and loved him most had encircled him, lifting him up, trying to hold tight to keep him from slipping away. Their efforts had seemed to be working. Earlier that day, Bubba had gotten a couple new tires for one of his cars, he’d stopped by the government center in Smiths Station to pick up his new city credit card, he’d checked in at the country market. He’d also sent a long and heartfelt letter to the congregation of First Baptist, thanking them for Pastor Appreciation Day, in which he seemed to see a future. “I look forward to continuing our journey of faith, growth, and service together,” he’d written. Now he’d gone missing. In Auburn, Carter Copeland received a call from his stepmother, Angela. “Your dad just called me. And he said that he loves me and that he’s always loved me and to go to my parents’ house. And then the call dropped off, and now every time I call him, it goes straight to voicemail. I don’t know what to do, Carter. You know him better than anybody. Where is he?”\\n\\nBy then, the Lee County sheriff’s department had fanned out all over the county to find Bubba and make sure he was okay. It wasn’t just law enforcement, either—Bubba’s friends and family had also begun searching for him, and as Carter ran to his car to make the drive from Auburn, Lisa Deason, who had worked as Bubba’s communications director in Smiths Station, had gone looking for him, too, and was pulling up at Bubba’s house. Deason had helped him draft letters of resignation as mayor and pastor just the day before. The letter resigning from his position as pastor read, in part, “Admittedly, there have been instances where my wife and I have taken private pictures within the confines of our home, which should have never been shared online. I realize this was a significant lapse in judgment and a personal failure, for which I bear complete and absolute responsibility. . . . I apologize for any distress or humiliation my actions may have caused. Love to all, Bubba.” The letter would never be sent.\\n\\nLike many of his other friends, Deason had been urging Bubba to get out of town for a few days, let the Internet find somebody else to destroy, let things blow over. That morning, though, 1819 News had dropped its second feature on Bubba and, mesmerized by the coverage on his phone, he had started telling people that he didn’t know if he could go on. The night before, Dan Elkins and Jason Price had had a long talk with Bubba about his growing despair, and Elkins had asked him, “Bubba, where are your guns?” Bubba said that he had surrendered his handgun to a safety officer in Smiths Station. As several of his friends would say, though, he lives in the South and his name is Bubba—he’s got more than one gun.\\n\\nThe latest 1819 News piece seemed to break something in Bubba, unleashing a lethal shame, and by that afternoon his phone was as dangerous a weapon as his gun.\\n\\nNot finding Bubba at home, Deason stood in the driveway of his house and called 911, saying that her friend was suicidal, and at that moment, his Tahoe pulled up in front of the house on Oakhurst Drive. He got out and left the motor running. “What are you doing here?” he asked her.\\n\\n“I came to check on you.”\\n\\n“Who’s with you?”\\n\\n“I’m by myself.”\\n\\n“Do not tell Angela where I am. I mean it. Don’t you tell a soul where I am.”\\n\\nBubba went into the house for no more than thirty seconds, and when he came out he was walking fast and moved to get back in his truck. “I love you,” he told Deason, “but I got to go.”\\n\\nShe said, “No, I’m not going to let you do this, Bubba! Please don’t do this. You have way more people that love you than you can even imagine. Don’t do this. Don’t do this to your family. Please. Don’t.” Deason was sobbing now and trying to hold on to Bubba, with her arms wrapped around him. No, I’m not letting you leave. Realizing she couldn’t restrain him, she let go, ran around him, jumped into the driver’s seat, turned off the ignition, and grabbed the steering wheel. I’m not going to let you leave.\\n\\n“I’m going to do it in front of you if you don’t move,” he said. Bubba pulled her out of the truck, and in desperation, she was thinking, What the hell can I do? In that instant, 911 called back, and instead of the operator, it was Jeff Pitts with the sheriff’s department on the line.\\n\\n“What’s going on?” Pitts asked.\\n\\n“He’s trying to leave and he won’t listen to me! He’s adamant. He says he’s got to end it.”\\n\\n“Let me talk to him.”\\n\\n“Bubba, it’s Major Pitts, Jeff Pitts.”\\n\\n“Jeff, man, I love you,” Bubba said. “But I’m done. I can’t do this no more.”\\n\\nBubba handed the phone to Deason, got in his truck, and peeled away.\\n\\nAs he drove, a cousin who had joined the search pulled up behind him. Bubba told him, If these deputies make me stop, you’re going to see something that I do not want you to see.\\n\\nCarter was driving 100 miles per hour toward Mechanicsville Cemetery, because he knew his father might be there. He called his father’s number over and over. Nothing. And then his father called him.\\n\\n“I love you, buddy,” Bubba said. “I’ve lived my whole life to make sure that you are successful and that you have what you need. And I just want you to know that I love you more than anything in this world.”\\n\\n“I knew immediately what that meant,” Carter says. “And I just said, ‘Please, Dad, please tell me you’re not doing what I think you’re doing. Please, we can get through this.’ ”\\n\\n“It’s too late, son. I love you. I’m so sorry.”\\n\\n“I told him, ‘You have nothing to be sorry about. There’s nothing to be sorry for. I love you. You’re my hero. Always will be. This is going to be horrible. We’ll get through it.’ ”\\n\\n“I’m sorry. This is what I have to do. This is the only way out.”\\n\\nCarter remembers feeling desperate to hold on, desperate to find the words that would make his father stay, desperate. He screamed at the top of his lungs and felt a rush of emotion such that he thought his vocal cords might explode. I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! “I screamed it as loud as I could for as long as he was on the line, because I knew he was listening. I knew. I could see he was still on the call. I kept screaming. That’s all I knew to say was, I love you! It’s okay. I love you. It’s okay!”\\n\\nAnd then silence.\\n\\nIn the immediate aftermath of Bubba’s death, along a country road in the town of Beulah, Lee County sheriff Jay Jones took possession of his electronic devices, and his office searched them for evidence of criminal conduct. They found none. “In my view, Bubba Copeland would never intentionally do anything to harm anyone,” Jones told me. “I just don’t think that he was that type of person.”\\n\\nDavid White would write a new sermon for the Sunday after Bubba’s death, staying up well past midnight the night before, sitting at his dinner table, writing in longhand. He would preach Psalm 23:1–6, just as Bubba had in his last service. And he wanted to make sure the world knew that the church had remained true to its pastor and always would. “Despite what may have been implied in the media,” he wrote, “members of this church have been steadfast in their love and concern for our pastor.”\\n\\nWe all have things that we don’t want other people to know about us. Things that might be hard to explain, even to ourselves. The First Baptist Church of Phenix City did not abandon Bubba Copeland, even after learning the secrets that he might not have been able to explain even to himself.\\n\\nBubba’s body would be turned away by the two Baptist cemeteries in Smiths Station, his hometown, the town that he loved. He is buried in a private family plot many miles away.\\n\\nAs I finished my reporting for this story, I took to asking the people in Bubba’s life what they might say to the people at 1819 News if they had the chance. Several told me that they are required to love them and will be praying for them. As Bubba Copeland always said, “God loves you, and so do we.”\\n\\n'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-11T19:57:00',\n",
       "   'content': 'The indefatigable Jefferson Morley first alerted us to this scoop from Axios that Morley rightly calls mind-bending.\\n\\nThe FBI just discovered about 2,400 records tied to President Kennedy’s assassination that were never provided to a board tasked with reviewing and disclosing the documents, Axios has learned. The still-secret records are contained in 14,000 pages of documents the FBI found in a review triggered by President Trump’s Jan. 23 executive order demanding the release of all JFK assassination records. The discovery—61 years after Kennedy was killed in Dallas—follows decades of government reluctance to release all documents related to the assassination, which fueled a mountain of conspiracy theories. The existence of the new documents was disclosed Friday to the White House, when the Office of the Director of National Intelligence submitted its plan to disclose the assassination records under Trump’s order.\\n\\nAlmost from the moment the shots rang out in Dallas, the FBI has been stumbling over itself. Now we discover that its vetting and releasing of documents under the 1992 Assassination Records Collection Act has been of a piece with the moment in 1963 when Dallas FBI agent James Hosty flushed a threatening note from Lee Harvey Oswald down the john. The unearthed files include material that researchers like Morley have been trying to get for years—and for compelling reasons.\\n\\nThe newly discovered FBI files could have relevance in the ongoing federal lawsuit filed by the Mary Ferrell Foundation against the Biden administration in 2022. It alleges federal agencies had more documents related to the assassination that they weren’t turning over to the National Archives. They include: Jailhouse recordings of mobster Carlos Marcello, who claimed he was involved in the assassination, and the CIA files of George Joannides. He was the chief of covert action at the CIA station in Miami and was a case officer for a New Orleans-based CIA-funded exile group that had a series of encounters with Oswald before the shooting. Joannides also was accused of misleading a House committee investigating the assassination by failing to disclose his ties to Oswald. “The Joannides file sounds exactly like the newly discovered FBI files,” Morley said. “It’s something assassination-related that was never turned over to the Archives.”\\n\\nWe’ve been fooled by what we thought was the sound of ice cracking on all of this too often to make me sanguine about anything coming of it. But the situation, at least to my mind, pits the FBI against the CIA, which traditionally has dragged its feet on releasing what it knows about Oswald—which is considerable. Joannides, for example, was a CIA psyop officer. If the FBI releases its files on him, the folks at Langley are going to have their mellows harshed considerably. About damn time.'},\n",

       "   'title': 'The Trump Administration Has Finally Gotten a Media Scandal They Can’t Lie Their Way Out Of',\n",
       "   'time': '2025-02-14T18:00:00',\n",
       "   'content': 'It now appears that the administration may have screwed the pooch in the most exquisite way possible—by assuming that everyone they’ve brought into the government is as unprincipled and slavishly loyal as, say, every Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives. This has put the entire Department of Justice into a jackpot over New York mayor Eric Adams and given the administration a media-scandal spectacular that it can’t lie its way out of. From The New York Times:\\n\\nManhattan’s U.S. attorney on Thursday resigned rather than obey an order from a top Justice Department official to drop the corruption case against New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams. Then, when Justice Department officials transferred the case to the public integrity section in Washington, which oversees corruption prosecutions, the two men who led that unit also resigned, according to five people with knowledge of the matter. Several hours later, three other lawyers in the unit also resigned, according to people familiar with the developments. The serial resignations represent the most high-profile public opposition so far to President Trump’s tightening control over the Justice Department. They were a stunning repudiation of the administration’s attempt to force the dismissal of the charges against Mr. Adams.\\n\\nSee how easy it is to make this administration look foolish in public? See how easy it is to cut the political legs out from under it based on its utter lack of ethics? The stench of this one is going to linger.\\n\\nThe prime hero in this saga is Danielle Sassoon, the Federalist Society member and former clerk for the late Justice Antonin Scalia whom the administration installed as the acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, one of the most important federal prosecution posts in the country. Sassoon resigned rather than follow an order from acting deputy attorney general Emil Bove to drop the prosecution against Adams for public corruption. Bove then tried to kick the decision over to the DOJ’s Public Integrity Section, only to have the top two officials in that unit—Kevin Driscoll and John Keller—resign rather than carry out Bove’s instructions.\\n\\nThe agency’s justification for dropping the case was explicitly political; Mr. Bove had argued that the investigation would prevent Mr. Adams from fully cooperating with Mr. Trump’s immigration crackdown. Mr. Bove made a point of saying that Washington officials had not evaluated the strength of the evidence or the legal theory behind the case.\\n\\nAnd Sassoon did not go quietly. She sent a letter explaining her resignation to putative attorney general Pam Bondi in which she explained her refusal to honor Bove’s attempt to ratfck the Adams case. In it, she explained in quite stark terms that the current president is running an administration that can be bribed with mere sycophancy.\\n\\nThe reasons advanced by Mr. Bove for dismissing the indictment are not ones I can in good faith defend as in the public interest and as consistent with the principles of impartiality and fairness that guide my decision-making. ¶ First, Mr. Bove proposes dismissing the charges against Adams in return for his assistance in enforcing the federal immigration laws, analogizing to the prisoner exchange in which the United States freed notorious Russian arms dealer Victor Bout in return for an American prisoner in Russia. Such an exchange with Adams violates commonsense beliefs in the equal administration of justice, the Justice Manual, and the Rules of Professional Conduct.... Adams has argued in substance—and Mr. Bove appears prepared to concede—that Adams should receive leniency for federal crimes solely because he occupies an important public position and can use that position to assist in the Administration’s policy priorities.\\n\\nAt which point, Sassoon dropped some legal Latin that landed on Bove’s head like a 500-pound bag of dung.\\n\\nRather than be rewarded, Adams’s advocacy should be called out for what it is: an improper offer of immigration enforcement assistance in exchange for a dismissal of his case. Although Mr. Bove disclaimed any intention to exchange leniency in this case for Adams’s assistance in enforcing federal law, that is the nature of the bargain laid bare in Mr. Bove’s memo. That is especially so given Mr. Bove’s comparison to the Bout prisoner exchange, which was quite expressly a quid pro quo [emphasis our own], but one carried out by the White House, and not the prosecutors in charge of Bout’s case.\\n\\n(And hilariously, as shrewdly noted over at Scott Lemieux’s LGM, in her letter to Bondi, Sassoon says that, at a meeting with Adams’s attorneys, Bove admonished her aides for taking notes—literally bringing to life Stringer Bell’s famous admonition.)\\n\\nBove already has resorted to threatening Sassoon and the other prosecutors with investigations of their conduct in office. I don’t like his chances. Meanwhile, demands are heating up on New York governor Kathy Hochul to use her power to remove Adams as mayor. Once that happens, Eric Adams will find how friendless he really is, and Kathy Hochul will find it necessary to stop listening to her voicemail for the foreseeable future.'},\n",

However, this week the ICIJ weighed in on how the administration’s cruel and pointless assault of USAID is decimating the independent press in a lot of the countries that need it the most.\\n\\nThe United States allocated $268 million in 2025 to support independent media and the free flow of information. A USAID fact sheet from 2023 that was on its website before the site went dark on Feb. 1 showed the agency provided funding to more than 700 non-state news outlets and 6,000 journalists, the press freedom group Reporters Without Borders reported.\\n\\nAutocrats who have long attempted to control the media have cheered the foreign assistance freeze. A spokesman for Russia’s Foreign Ministry described USAID as “a machine for interfering in internal affairs” and “a mechanism for changing regimes.” El Salvador’s president accused USAID of using its funds to “fuel dissent [and] finance protests.” And Iran’s state-run media praised aid cuts that it described as “cutting the budget of foreign-based opposition.”\\n\\nWell, if it brings together Russian kleptocrats, Central American autocrats, and the mullahs in Tehran, it sounds like the same kind of foreign-policy triumph that the president is seeking in Ukraine. Maybe vice-president J. Divan Vance can take a break from lecturing Europe about the “retreat” of “free speech” long enough to free up the money for reporters from countries where the odds are pretty good that they can get shot.\\n\\nThe Trump administration’s decision “is showing authoritarian regimes: ‘Oh, they closed USAID with such ease, closed their website, made them vanish from history,’” said Rawan Damen, the director of Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism, which received U.S. foreign assistance. “Maybe they will next say, ‘We are not happy with ARIJ. OK, we can erase them, too.’”\\n\\nFor ARIJ, one of the leading investigative outlets in the Middle East, the aid freeze erased roughly 20% of its budget. Like many other outlets, the abruptness of the funding cuts and accompanying stop-work orders compounded the financial damage. News organizations also incurred expenses in 2024 that have not been reimbursed due to the aid freeze, and had already hired journalists and launched projects on the assumption that they would receive promised U.S. funds in the current year. “There is total chaos about what this means,” Damen said. “Nobody knows what’s happening, nobody is allowed to speak to anybody.”\\n\\nWhich, in case you haven’t noticed, is exactly the journalistic climate the administration is trying to promote over here, so the fact that it’s doing the same overseas can’t be any kind of surprise. For example, one of the press organizations depending on USAID money is the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, which disburses funds to media outlets dedicated to reporting on how international plutocrats are looting the world, and how they’re hiding their money, and how they turn the world’s tax laws into bloody rags hanging from the withered limbs of representative democracy. Naturally, this is not an area that the current smash-and-grab administration appreciates being explored.\\n\\nA spokesperson told ICIJ that 29% of OCCRP’s 2025 operational budget has been frozen, or more than $5 million, and that as a result it has laid off 20% of staff and instituted pay cuts, and that “almost all grants have ended” to local and regional media organizations...President Donald Trump has said USAID was run by “radical left lunatics,” and on social media accused the organization of funneling money to media organizations “as a ‘payoff’ for creating good stories about the Democrats.” The White House last week specifically cited USAID grants to OCCRP and to train Sri Lankan journalists as examples of wasteful spending by the aid agency.\\n\\nNot for nothing, but Sri Lanka has a new, leftist government that seems to be trying to get a hold on the corruption that’s helped throw the country’s finances down the well. (Sri Lanka has been in desperate financial shape for most of this decade, and that’s prompted human-rights abuses as well.) So, once again, we can judge this administration’s policy by that which it deems wasteful. I mean, this isn’t as important as allowing the president to showboat at the Daytona 500, but then what is?'},\n",

Fewer and fewer Americans are finding out about current events from traditional mainstream sources like newspapers and TV news; the social media and streaming personalities that are replacing them often take a conspiratorial, partisan, and not particularly factual perspective. Many of them, in the most recent election, supported Trump.\\n\\nOne way an opposition party might work around this is by having its leaders communicate directly with voters through their own social media channels, or by creating viral moments. Unfortunately, Democrats’ top figures at present are Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both of whom come from the extremely cautious, horribly overthought, inexplicably alliteration-brained school of “Pokémon Go to the Polls”–type messaging that makes me, for one, want to lie face down in a drainage ditch. These are not men who are going to break through on TikTok.\\n\\nRelated From Slate Americans Are Asking: Did Trump Take Egg? Read More\\n\\nA wave of polls released Wednesday and Thursday, though, indicates that the Elon Musk–led dynamite job in Washington is not going over well with voters, however they may be hearing about it. Among the results:\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n• A Washington Post/Ipsos poll found that 53 percent of Americans disapprove of Trump’s job performance, against 45 percent who approve. Only 34 percent approved of Musk’s work, against 49 percent who disapproved.\\n\\n• Elsewhere in the Post poll, a 57 percent majority said Trump has exceeded his authority as president. Respondents disapproved, by a 52–26 margin, of giving Musk the power to shut down government departments. In a Quinnipiac poll, 55 percent of voters said Musk has too much power, as compared to 36 percent who said he has the right amount. In a Reuters/Ipsos poll, 62 percent of respondents objected to the idea that the president should be able to fire federal employees who don’t support him; only 23 percent agreed.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n• A comprehensive YouGov poll found more respondents opposed than in support of Trump’s push to fire hundreds of thousands of federal workers. Those surveyed, as a group, also disapproved of initiatives to rename the Gulf of Mexico, drop corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams, allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement to arrest undocumented immigrants in places of worship, impose 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, offer refugee status to white South Africans, and name himself chair of the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts (LOL), among others. (That said, YouGov’s poll did find voters approving of Trump’s performance overall, 50–45. He’s still juuuuust above water in the FiveThirtyEight approval-rating aggregator.)\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n• There’s trouble for Trump even on immigration and the economy, the issues where he traditionally polls the best. In the Post poll, wide majorities disapproved of his initiatives to deport immigrants whose only crime is being in the U.S. without documentation (57–39 against) and to expel legal refugees who are from countries experiencing violent conflicts (56–38 against). The Post found Trump underwater by 8 points on his handling of the economy; in the Quinnipiac poll, he was underwater by 4 points on the economy and 3 points on immigration. (Note that the poll’s margin of error was +/- 3 percent.) CNN found that 62 percent say he hasn’t gone far enough to reduce the price of everyday goods, such as egg.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTrump has also spent the week attacking Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, who objected to the administration’s effort to draft a Russia-friendly “peace” settlement that would end the war between the two countries. Zelensky, Trump claims, does not have the support of the Ukrainian people and is, somehow, to blame for Russia’s invasion. The YouGov poll found that 62 percent of Americans support Ukraine more than Russia in that conflict, versus a minuscule 4 percent who said they support Russia more than Ukraine. Forty-seven percent of respondents said they had a favorable impression of Zelensky; only 12 percent said the same about Vladimir Putin.\\n\\nIn short, Trump’s heel turn against Ukraine is probably not one that is going to arrest the slide of his approval rating. Nor will triggering further inflation by imposing more tariffs, as he threatened this week to do on automobiles, prescription drugs, and computer chips. Voters also might not like how the unemployment rate will be affected by hundreds of thousands of laid-off federal tax-refund processors, food safety inspectors, and national park rangers filing for benefits—nor will they likely enjoy the consequences of those cuts.\\n\\nToo bad for Donald Trump and Elon Musk, huh?

       "   'content': 'Few people are as knee-deep in our work-related anxieties and sticky office politics as Alison Green, who has been fielding workplace questions for a decade now on her website Ask a Manager. In Direct Report, she spotlights themes from her inbox that help explain the modern workplace and how we could be navigating it better.\\n\\nEver realized you haven’t seen a particular co-worker in weeks, asked around, and discovered that they left the company a month ago but no one bothered to tell anyone? If you’ve worked for reasonably functional companies, hopefully the answer is no. But, whether through incompetence or design, a startling number of employers don’t announce it when employees depart, leaving their colleagues to piece it together themselves after their emails go unanswered for weeks.\\n\\nIf this sounds ridiculous to you, you are correct. It’s incredibly inefficient! People shouldn’t need to wonder: Is Jane on leave? When will she be back? Will she be back? Who do I go to with questions about X? What about the project she was working on for me?\\n\\nFor people employed at companies like these, the practice strikes them as strangely as it’s probably landing with you now. Here are some firsthand accounts from colleagues of the disappeared:\\n\\n“My old company used to do this. They would fire people suddenly—and then just never tell anyone that that person was gone. You would eventually just go looking for someone because they never responded to their emails, and when you found their desk empty, someone would whisper to you that they were gone. There was never any announcement about it at all, nor was there any information on who would handle their tasks going forward. A TON of stuff fell through the cracks because no one took up the duties of people when they left or were fired.”\\n\\n“I worked for a company that would inform only the immediate team (the ones who worked every day with the person and would immediately notice). For everyone else, it would be as if the ex-employee just disappeared. Sometimes you’d find out from the rumor mill; other times you’d just get a bounced email and find out someone had been gone for months.”\\n\\n“More than once, I showed up for a regularly scheduled meeting with a contact, and someone else was already sitting at their desk! It was a widely known fact that the IT organization created a ticket each time someone left the company, so many co-workers checked those tickets regularly to keep tabs on who was leaving. That company had a lot of turnover, and we all felt as if they were trying to hide it—but if that was the goal, they were not successful.”\\n\\n“I’ve worked at companies where I wouldn’t even get a bounced email! I’d send emails and they would disappear and I’d get no response at all. In the end, I’d try contacting someone else on the team, which was really difficult because there were no lists of who was on what team. Finally, I’d find out that the person had been laid off or resigned—and no one had informed any of the people on projects they were involved with or even closed the email account, so emails were still being accepted but not actually going anywhere!”\\n\\nNeedless to say, this results in a lot of wasted energy, with people sending email after email that will never be read, waiting on responses that will never come, and scrambling to figure out who’s covering what work. To wit:\\n\\n“I don’t know why companies are so fond of handling layoffs as if they’re midnight raids by the secret police, but it’s weirdly common. And every single time, it causes problems. I once saw someone who was given no notice at all. They just walked her out one day and didn’t tell anyone. Turned out she was the only person handling documentation for a major project in a satellite location. Because she never had a chance to talk to anybody, the other writers didn’t know they needed to take over, and the people in the satellite office didn’t know she’d gone. There was an awful lot of panic a month later on ship date.”\\n\\n“We had two very deep rounds of layoffs during the pandemic (travel industry), and the only way we could find out is if I sent them an email and it bounced back, with the word Leaver on the return email address. I have sometimes wasted HOURS trying to track down something I needed because I had no idea who was even left in the department.”\\n\\n“I worked for a place that did this as well, and it was absurd. What did they think? That if they refused to tell us who got laid off, we wouldn’t notice if that person never came in or was never online again?! I don’t know if these businesses think that maybe people will just quietly go about their work and ignore the layoffs if the higher-ups refuse to talk about it, but whenever we had them, people would spend a good half of the day or more going around, talking to everyone they knew, trying to find out who had been laid off. It inevitably led to a lot of time spent in speculation and not working, whereas if we had just been given a list, we would have chatted about it briefly and moved on!”\\n\\nIn some cases, employers even go out of their way to make it look as if the departed employees are still working at their jobs, long after they’re actually gone:\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“After an employee leaves, my company continues to use that employee’s email address to contact clients as if that employee were still working there. When a client calls, they just tell them that the employee is out of the office. This continues for months at a time, because they don’t want our clients to know how much turnover we have. I’m concerned that after I’m gone, the reputation and rapport that I’ve worked to build with my clients will be completely destroyed by whoever is pretending to be me.”\\n\\nThis is, obviously, bizarre. Clients are aware that people leave jobs and that companies have turnover. Of course, if a company’s turnover is particularly high, there’s good reason to worry that clients will be concerned about having a different account manager every other month … but the solution to that is to figure out how to retain more employees, not to engage in elaborate deceptions to hide it.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSo what drives employers to hide departures, even internally? In many cases it’s a poorly thought-out attempt to control the message: They don’t want to look unstable, they don’t want people to think their finances are precarious, or they want to minimize drama. Of course, this approach ends up maximizing drama, as rumors swirl and people speculate on what happened. It also creates a culture in which people don’t trust their leadership to give them relevant (and very routine and normal) information. This seems especially relevant at this particular moment, when so many are losing their jobs or fearful about losing their jobs due to the new administration’s mass firings of the federal workforce.\\n\\nMore than anything, hushed-up departures are nearly always a hallmark of management that’s fully disconnected from workers’ day-to-day realities. The idea that employees wouldn’t need to know about the departure of colleagues they rely on is so divorced from how work works that anyone at a company operating this way should seriously question the competence of its leadership. They might not be receiving departure announcements, but that’s one message that is getting delivered, loud and clear.'},\n",

Delegated lines of authority are muddied, overwritten by social contracts among agency leaders, and operations suffer huge bottlenecks because no one—often not even the political appointees—knows if they have the authority to make decisions. And those appointees have been directed to distrust the career staffers who actually know how to get things done, or even tune agency operations to Trump’s own political goals.\\n\\nSo, at every level, the administration implements a reactionary DARVO protocol, the modus operandi of abusers looking to control a situation that has spiraled out of hand or spilled into public view.'},\n",

The strange thing is that despite the information vacuum with Barron, he still managed to cause a minor scandal with his campus’s College Republicans group in recent days, a scandal that has then, even more mystifyingly, been widely covered in the media, earning articles in People, the New York Times, USA Today, and more. Though the competition for this week’s stupidest news event will no doubt be fierce, I’d venture to say we’ve got a contender in this nonstory about Barron Trump leading to the forced resignation of the president of the NYU Republicans.\\n\\nThis all started last week, when NYU senior Kaya Walker was quoted in a write-\\n\\naround Vanity Fair piece about Barron Trump, his life at NYU, and the fascination surrounding him, particularly among his fellow members of Generation Z. Walker, who was identified as the head of her school’s chapter of the College Republicans, told the magazine, “He’s sort of like an oddity on campus. He goes to class, he goes home.” This seems anodyne enough, so much so that you might question whether it’s a sentiment worth quoting at all—“sort of like an oddity”? Not exactly trenchant commentary! Honestly, I have more questions about Walker citing Lana Del Rey as the most exciting celebrity in right-wing culture in the same article. But apparently the “oddity” quote was enough to get her in trouble with the College Republicans bigwigs, who pressured Walker to resign and said in a press release that her statement “does not align with the values and principles upheld by our organization.” (In their statement condemning Walker’s comments, the College Republicans of America also took it upon themselves to extend an official invitation to Barron Trump “to join us in reshaping the Republican Party.” Good luck with that!)\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn her resignation letter, which the NYU College Republicans shared on X, Walker apologized but said that her comments were “ridiculously misconstrued.” In a later interview with the New York Post, Walker elaborated, blaming the conservative X account AF Post, which shared the story, for taking her comments out of context. AF Post “took it to say that I was saying that Barron was strange for being a commuter—which I thought was crazy because I’m a commuter,” Walker told the Post. The tweet was viewed millions of times and sparked many outraged-on-Barron’s-behalf reactions. “They [made it] look like I was calling the president’s son weird, but I feel like anybody who can read would know that’s not what I was doing,” she went on. I mean, since when is seeing a world-famous 6-foot-7 teenager flanked by Secret Service agents on a college campus not an oddity? Did they want her to lie and say that Barron doesn’t stand out, that actually no one notices him? Trick question: What anyone who got remotely caught up in a tizzy about this on social media obviously wants is for Walker never to have spoken to the evil media at all, never mind that speaking to the media, though it’s usually the campus paper and not Vanity Fair, is often part of the job description for these sorts of roles in college organizations.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhile it’s hard to feel too bad that a college student has been forced to step down from an extracurricular activity—she’ll be fine—it’s pretty ridiculous that anyone is being punished for this. Just so we’re clear, the conservative movement’s stance is that if your wildly racist tweets surface, you deserve another chance to do important government work, but if you acknowledge the existence of Barron Trump on the record in your capacity as a leader of a relevant group at his college, that’s out of line.

       "   'content': 'CNN —\\n\\nPope Francis is showing “slight improvement” but is still in “critical” condition, the Vatican said in an update on Monday, adding that his mild kidney issues are not concerning.\\n\\n“The clinical conditions of the Holy Father, although critical, show a slight improvement. Even today there were no episodes of asthmatic respiratory crises; some laboratory tests have improved,” the statement read.\\n\\nThe Vatican added that Francis’ mild kidney issues, first announced on Sunday, do “not cause concern” and that his oxygen therapy continues “with slightly reduced flows and percentage of oxygen.”\\n\\n“The doctors, considering the complexity of the clinical picture, prudentially do not yet release the prognosis,” the Vatican said on Monday about the 88-year-old pontiff who has been in hospital battling pneumonia in both his lungs.\\n\\nFrancis can still move, is not bed-ridden, and is eating normally, Vatican sources told CNN on Monday.\\n\\nOn Monday morning, Francis received the Eucharist and resumed work in the afternoon, the Vatican said. In the evening, he called the Parish Priest of the Parish of Gaza, with whom he has been in frequent contact since Israel launched its siege on the enclave following the October 7 Hamas-led attacks.\\n\\nThe pope was first admitted to a clinic in Rome 10 days ago, undergoing tests for a respiratory tract infection. He was later diagnosed with pneumonia.\\n\\nFaith leaders and worshippers around the world have gathered to pray for the Argentine leader, whose schedule has been largely cleared due to his intensive medical treatment.\\n\\nOn Monday, the pope’s cousin Carla Rabezzana, 93, who lives in the municipality of Portacomaro, in the northwestern Italian province of Asti, said the family is worried for his health.\\n\\n“We are all worried sick. We hope he will recover quickly and get over this bad moment. I follow everything from the news, I am very agitated,” she told the Italian state outlet RAI.\\n\\nDuring mass on Sunday in Manhattan, the Archbishop of New York, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, said that Francis is “in very, very fragile health and probably close to death.”\\n\\nIn Argentina, a Buenos Aires resident spoke of her concerns about the pope’s health. “His health is not only his health; it’s also that of global peace. For this reason, I’d like him to live longer if it means he doesn’t have to suffer,” Claudia Malta told Reuters.\\n\\nEarly on Monday, Francis was “awake” and “in good humor” after the “night passed well,” the Vatican said. Over the weekend, he received high flows of oxygen to help alleviate his respiratory crisis. He did not deliver the weekly Angelus prayer Sunday – for only the third time in his almost 12-year papacy.\\n\\nThe pope’s condition seemed better earlier last week, with the Vatican describing him as responding “positively” to medical treatment on Thursday.\\n\\n‘Mild’ kidney problems\\n\\nOn Sunday the Vatican said some of the pope’s blood tests indicated “an initial, mild, renal failure, which is currently under control,” and that the pontiff was “vigilant and well-oriented.”\\n\\nDr. Jamin Brahmbhatt from Orlando Health Medical Group Urology, who specializes in kidney surgery, told CNN one should not be alarmed by the Vatican’s update on the pope’s kidney health.\\n\\n“I don’t think it’s anything significant per se, but we can tell his condition is still quite critical,” Brahmbhatt said on Sunday. “The kidneys itself are very delicate organs but they’re also very resilient.”\\n\\nHe said that in older adults, “infections can quickly worsen if the body’s immune response kicks into overdrive — something we call sepsis.” When pneumonia leads to sepsis, widespread inflammation can hurt multiple organs, including the kidneys, Brahmbhatt added.\\n\\n“In Pope Francis’ case, that’s showing up as mild renal failure. Kidney damage can be temporary and improve with treatment, or it can be permanent,” he said.\\n\\nFrancis took part in the Holy Mass from the apartment set up on the 10th floor of Gemelli hospital on Sunday morning, the Vatican said. Those taking care of him during his hospitalization also took part. The pope thanked medical staff for their dedication in the text of Sunday’s sermon, which was sent to the press in advance.\\n\\nHistory of respiratory infections\\n\\nFrancis has a vulnerability to respiratory infections. As a young man, he suffered a severe bout of pneumonia that led to the removal of part of one lung.\\n\\nIn 2021, doctors also surgically removed part of his colon in relation to diverticulitis, which can cause inflammation or infection of the colon. He was hospitalized with bronchitis in 2023, and in recent months has had two falls where he bruised his chin and hurt his arm, which was put into a sling.\\n\\nThe pope’s doctors have advised “complete rest.” Even so, he has continued to do some work, including on the first two days of hospitalization.\\n\\nFrancis has also been signing off decisions in the clinic, Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni told CNN on Wednesday. Only his “closest collaborators” have visited him, the spokesperson told reporters earlier this week. On Wednesday, Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni visited him for 20 minutes.\\n\\n“We joked as always. He hasn’t lost his proverbial sense of humor,” the Italian prime minister said in a statement.\\n\\nOn Sunday, prayers were said for Francis at Masses in Rome and at St Peter’s Baslicia in the Vatican. At the hospital, people have been gathering to leave balloons, candles and flowers for the pontiff in front of a statue of Pope John Paul II.\\n\\nThe Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, the seat of Sunni Islamic learning in Cairo, Egypt, said he was praying for Francis. The pair have forged a close bond in recent years.\\n\\n“I pray to God to grant my dear brother Pope Francis a swift recovery and to bless him with health and well-being so that he continues his journey in serving humanity,” the Grand Imam, Ahmed El-Tayeb, said.\\n\\nThis is story has been updated with new reporting.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'The microgravity of the ISS allows for unique science experiments.\\n\\nElon Musk calls for deorbiting of the ISS. Here\\'s what the space station does\\n\\nElon Musk called this week for the deorbiting of the International Space Station (ISS) \"as soon as possible.\"\\n\\n\"It is time to begin preparations for deorbiting the [ISS],\" Musk wrote in a post on X on Thursday. \"It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let\\'s go to Mars.\"\\n\\nIn a follow-up post, Musk said he was planning to recommend to President Donald Trump that the station be brought down \"as soon as possible\" and that the 2030 timeline for deorbiting be moved up to two years from now.\\n\\nSpace experts told ABC News the ISS is very important in conducting scientific research, developing technologies, promoting STEM education and fostering diplomatic relationships. Deorbiting the station prematurely could end important innovations and studies pertaining to future space missions.\\n\\n\"It is just giving us great data on living and working in space, longitudinally, which will apply directly to our plans to return to the moon and then go on to Mars,\" Jordan Bimm, space historian and professor of science communication at the University of Chicago, told ABC News. \"So, it has a diplomatic purpose. It has an experiential purpose, and then obviously, it has these scientific and technological development purposes as well.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'d be a shame to cut this short for a non-technical reason, but for rather sort of political reason,\" he added.\\n\\nElon Musk speaks during the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland, Feb. 20, 2025. Nathan Howard/Reuters\\n\\nResearch and technology development in microgravity\\n\\nIn the 24 years that the ISS has been in orbit, there have been more than 4,000 experiments conducted, according to NASA.\\n\\nResearch is conducted across several disciplines, including biology, earth sciences, human health and physical science, the federal space agency said.\\n\\nThe microgravity of space allows experiments to be performed in a way that is unable to be replicated on Earth due to the planet\\'s gravity.\\n\\nBimm said he believes one of the most important findings to come out of ISS research is how living and working in microgravity for extended periods of time affects the human body.\\n\\n\"We have found by studying astronauts living and working, by doing self-experiments on the scientists and astronauts on board, that microgravity affects the body in lots of deleterious ways,\" he said. \"That leads to your bone loss, muscle loss, changes in the fluid inside our bodies that are normally being pulled down by Earth\\'s gravity, changes to the eye and vision loss and things like that.\"\\n\\nHe went on, \"We have gotten good data on how that progresses over time, and importantly, we have developed countermeasures for these things as well, including resistance training or running on a treadmill, things like that that we wouldn\\'t have without the ISS, without this platform where humans can spend long periods of time consistently and be studied In a scientific setting.\"\\n\\nHe said continuing to study this will be important for future space missions, including future moon missions under the Artemis program and eventual missions to Mars.\\n\\nDavid Alexander, director of the Rice Space Institute at Rice University in Houston, told ABC News there has also been the development of technologies and materials on the ISS that would benefit not only long-term space missions but life on Earth.\\n\\nThis field, called space manufacturing, includes DNA sequencing, developing new water purification systems and even drug development.\\n\\n\"The unique environment of space allows us to perhaps develop pure pharmaceuticals.

       "   'content': 'Elon Musk apparently no longer believes that crowdsourcing fact-checking through Community Notes can never be manipulated and is, thus, the best way to correct bad posts on his social media platform X.\\n\\nCommunity Notes are supposed to be added to posts to limit misinformation spread after a broad consensus is reached among X users with diverse viewpoints on what corrections are needed. But Musk now claims a \"fix\" is needed to prevent supposedly outside influencers from allegedly gaming the system.\\n\\n\"Unfortunately, @CommunityNotes is increasingly being gamed by governments & legacy media,\" Musk wrote on X. \"Working to fix this.\"\\n\\nMusk\\'s announcement came after Community Notes were added to X posts discussing a poll generating favorable ratings for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. That poll was conducted by a private Ukrainian company in partnership with a state university whose supervisory board was appointed by the Ukrainian government, creating what Musk seems to view as a conflict of interest.\\n\\nAlthough other independent polling recently documented a similar increase in Zelenskyy\\'s approval rating, NBC News reported, the specific poll cited in X notes contradicted Donald Trump\\'s claim that Zelenskyy is unpopular, and Musk seemed to expect X notes should instead be providing context to defend Trump\\'s viewpoint. Musk even suggested that by pointing to the supposedly government-linked poll in Community Notes, X users were spreading misinformation.\\n\\n\"It should be utterly obvious that a Zelensky[y]-controlled poll about his OWN approval is not credible!!\" Musk wrote on X.\\n\\nMusk\\'s attack on Community Notes is somewhat surprising. Although he has always maintained that Community Notes aren\\'t \"perfect,\" he has defended Community Notes through multiple European Union probes challenging their effectiveness and declared that the goal of the crowdsourcing effort was to make X \"by far the best source of truth on Earth.\" At CES 2025, X CEO Linda Yaccarino bragged that Community Notes are \"good for the world.\"\\n\\nYaccarino invited audience members to \"think about it as this global collective consciousness keeping each other accountable at global scale in real time,\" but just one month later, Musk is suddenly casting doubts on that characterization while the European Union continues to probe X.\\n\\nPerhaps most significantly, Musk previously insisted as recently as last year that Community Notes could not be manipulated, even by Musk. He strongly disputed a 2024 report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate that claimed that toxic X users were downranking accurate notes that they personally disagreed with, claiming any attempt at gaming Community Notes would stick out like a \"neon sore thumb.\"'},\n",

It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let’s go to Mars,\" Musk wrote at midday on Thursday.\\n\\nThis original statement was somewhat ambiguous.

       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': \"The standoff at 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue was not much of a spectacle. On the first day of February, a handful of men working for Elon Musk had come to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), a few blocks from the White House, demanding full access to its headquarters. The agency’s staff refused. No guns were drawn. No punches thrown. Nobody involved the police. But in these early days of the Trump Administration, perhaps no other scene revealed more clearly the forces reshaping America’s government.\\n\\nOn one side stood an institution with a 64-year history, a $35 billion budget, and a mission enshrined in federal law. On the other stood Musk’s political wrecking crew. They identified themselves as members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a collection of temporary staffers with no charter, no website, and no clear legal authority. Its power derives from Musk, the wealthiest person on the planet, who has been deputized to dismantle vast swaths of the federal bureaucracy—slashing budgets, gutting the civil service, and stripping independent agencies of the ability to impede the President’s objectives.\\n\\nUSAID leadership had allowed Musk’s team, a group of his young and eager followers, to spend several days inside their headquarters at the end of January. “The DOGE kids,” as some of the staffers called them in private, walked the halls with clipboards in their hands, examining desks and questioning managers, according to several USAID officials who described the events to TIME. But as the weekend arrived, their demands—including access to sensitive facilities designed to store classified information—went too far for the agency’s heads of security. The men from DOGE threatened to call the U.S. Marshals and have them clear the building. They also informed Musk about the problem. “USAID is a criminal organization,” Musk wrote to his 215 million followers on his social media platform, X, soon after. “Time for it to die.”\\n\\nThe cause of Musk’s crusade remained unclear. But regardless of the reason, by the following morning, an agency that annually disburses tens of billions of dollars across the globe, fighting famine and disease and bringing clean water to millions, had mostly ceased to function. Within a week, nearly all its staff were placed on leave, its offices around the world shut down.\\n\\nPhoto-Illustration by TIME (Source Photos: Chip Somodevilla—Getty Images; Anna Moneymaker—Getty Images)\\n\\nClick here to order your copy of this issue\\n\\nEvery other government bureau got the message loud and clear. No single private citizen, certainly not one whose wealth and web of businesses are directly subject to the oversight of federal authorities, has wielded such power over the machinery of the U.S. government. So far, Musk appears accountable to no one but President Trump, who handed his campaign benefactor a sweeping mandate to bring the government in line with his agenda. DOGE directed all of TIME’s questions about its work to the White House, which declined to comment.\\n\\nRead More: How Elon Musk Became a Kingmaker.\\n\\nAlready, the DOGE team has taken over the U.S. Digital Service and established a beachhead within the federal human-resources department, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The Education Department is on edge, fearing a self-decapitation mandate is in the offing. Few agencies seem safe. Musk has shown that he will tolerate no opposition, no matter how justified. Days before the drama at USAID, a Treasury official refused DOGE access to the U.S. federal payment system. The official was forced to retire, and the newly appointed Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, gave DOGE the access it demanded. The Administration agreed on Feb. 5 to restrict that access, at least temporarily, after a group of past and present employees sued.\\n\\nThese are just the first ripples in a massive antigovernment wave. Budgets will be hacked. Valuable programs will be eliminated. Career civil servants will be purged, replaced with political appointees whose primary qualification is apparent fealty to the President. This is the course the electorate chose. And to many, the idea of one of the world’s most accomplished entrepreneurs attacking a sprawling, sclerotic federal bureaucracy with the same velocity and determination he brought to his car startup or rocket company is cause for celebration, not alarm. “The federal government is so big that there are surely significant opportunities for saving and efficiency,” says Robert Doar, president of the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right think tank. “The fact that the President and his team is giving this a lot of attention is a good thing.”\\n\\nBut a public backlash may be growing to Musk’s mission, and far more is at stake than the size of the federal balance sheet, the head count at agencies inside the Beltway, or the dangers of one unelected man possessing such unconstrained power. Soon Americans are going to learn where they interact with the federal government in ways they didn’t realize or took for granted. Companies that export tech products to China may no longer have State or Commerce Department employees available to explain, for free, how to avoid violating criminal law. Farmers in the Midwest may soon find USAID-funded buyers no longer paying for sacks of flour to send to refugee camps. Around the world, millions of people who depend on the U.S. for food, medicine, and shelter are suddenly on their own.\\n\\nRead More: Why TIME Chose Musk As 2021 Person of the Year.\\n\\nFor now, millions of government workers find themselves at Musk’s mercy. One described her team at the Department of Homeland Security assuming a “defensive crouch” as they awaited a visit from the DOGE. For an inkling of their fate, she added, her colleagues had turned to a book called Character Limit, which chronicles the way Musk took over Twitter two years ago and fired 80% of its staff, often with chaotic and lasting results.\\n\\nThe similarities to his assault on the bureaucracy have been uncanny. On Jan. 28, millions of civil servants across government received an email offering them eight months’ pay in exchange for their resignation. Musk had proposed much the same deal to Twitter’s employees two years earlier. He even used the same subject line: “Fork in the road.”\\n\\nNone of this came without warning. Among Musk’s friends in Silicon Valley, many understood his takeover of Twitter as preparation for a greater cause. “The mood is that hopefully Musk can do the same thing with the U.S. government,” one told TIME in November. Veterans of Trump’s first Administration likewise laid out their plans long before the elections, publishing a 900-page report known as Project 2025. One of its lead authors, Russell Vought, said in a speech two years ago that he wanted civil servants to be “traumatically affected” by the purge he envisioned. “We want their funding to be shut,” he said. “We want to put them in trauma.”\\n\\nRussell Vought, Trump’s pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget, at a confirmation hearing on Jan. 15. Andrew Harnik—Getty Images\\n\\nOn the campaign trail, Trump swore he had nothing to do with the plan. “It was inappropriate that they would come out with a document like that,” he told TIME in November. “Some things I vehemently disagreed with.” But once in office, he picked Vought to be in charge of the White House Office of Management and Budget, which now works closely with Musk to enact crucial parts of Project 2025. So far, the frenetic opening moves of the Trump presidency have tracked nearly two-thirds of its prescriptions, according to a TIME analysis.\\n\\nMusk never hid his intentions. Two weeks after the election, he co-wrote a piece in the Wall Street Journal that promised DOGE would help Trump “hire a lean team of small-government crusaders,” who would work to bring “mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.” That recruitment drive began soon after the elections, drawing from Musk’s acolytes in Silicon Valley, some barely out of college, and priming them to fan out across Washington.\\n\\nRead More: Inside Elon Musk's Struggle For the Future of AI.\\n\\nThe man Musk put in charge of staffing at DOGE was an aerospace engineer named Steve Davis, who previously led his cost-cutting efforts at Twitter. In late December, as the presidential transition unfolded inside the White House, Davis took part in a series of meetings with members of the Biden Administration. The Democratic staffers noted his fixation with an obscure branch of the White House called the U.S. Digital Service. Davis wanted to know how it operated, who it reported to, and what it could access.\\n\\nCreated in 2014, the USDS works with federal agencies to improve computer systems and databases. It houses a map of the government’s technology infrastructure and has contact points for the technology officer at nearly every federal agency. That made it the perfect place to host the DOGE. If Musk wanted to wither the limbs of the federal government, the USDS provided the veins that would let the poison flow.\\n\\nThe empowerment of USDS started on Inauguration Day. One of Trump’s first Executive Orders renamed it “the United States DOGE Service,” neatly preserving the office’s acronym. The order also ensured that the new entity would report directly to the White House chief of staff. Since then, the office has set up shop inside the Departments of State and Treasury. It began accessing personnel computer systems, firing contractors, and blocking payments on their contracts.\\n\\nMusk also sent a team to OPM. The office holds records on 2.1 million workers, the email address for nearly every federal employee, and tracks $59 billion per year in federal health care premiums and $88 billion per year in payments to federal retirees. The mass buyout offer to government employees originated from within Musk’s team at OPM, according to a source familiar with those actions. (Both DOGE and the White House declined to comment.)\\n\\nRead More: As Musk's DOGE Targets Federal Data, This Obscure Office Is at the Center\\n\\nNext, the DOGE team set to starving OPM itself. Brian Bjelde, who recently worked as vice president of human resources at Musk’s aerospace firm, told career supervisors at OPM that the “target” was to slash 70% of its staff, a move that would hobble its health care benefits and retirement-planning teams, says a current OPM official. Some senior leaders at OPM have been locked out of key databases, the official says, and political appointees have access to systems, including the Enterprise Human Resources Integration, without standard safeguard procedures designed to keep such information private. That system includes information like pay grades, length of service, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and home addresses.\\n\\nDays after Trump took office, the White House ordered a freeze on federal spending—from foreign aid to public-health programs, and everything in between. It would be lifted, the Administration said, as agencies fell in line with the President’s agenda: cracking down on immigration, ending diversity efforts, and stopping investments that reduce the impact of fossil fuels on the environment. Facing a court’s action, the White House rolled back the order.\\n\\nA protest outside the U.S. Treasury building in Washington, D.C., on Feb 4. Stefani Reynolds—Bloomberg/Getty Images\\n\\nMusk’s downsizing pressed ahead, and Trump continued to give his blessing. “Elon can’t do—and won’t do—anything without our approval,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Feb. 4. “We’ll give him the approval where appropriate,” he added. “Where not appropriate, we won’t.” Some took it as a sign that Trump might rein in his attack dog. But civil servants are not waiting around for that to happen. In Northern Virginia, home to tens of thousands of workers on the federal payroll and military service members, the typical town-hall meeting in the town of Leesburg attracts a few dozen people. Hundreds gathered on the night Musk shut down USAID. “We’re hearing bizarre stories,” says Representative Suhas Subramanyam, the local Democratic Congressman who spoke at the event. His office has been flooded with workers describing DOGE’s takeover, and he instructed his staff to log their testimony and assist whistle-blowers. Much of what they witnessed is “simply illegal,” Subramanyam insists to TIME. “We’re almost being tested and dared to sue or investigate.”\\n\\nRead More: Across Pennsylvania, Musk Deploys His Fame and Fortune For Trump.\\n\\nSome lawsuits have worked. The White House complied with court orders blocking its attempt to freeze trillions of dollars in federal spending. A judge’s ruling on Feb. 6 delayed the deadline for the buyout offer to government employees. Unions have filed suits related to DOGE on behalf of federal workers. Even Musk’s usual admirers have warned he is overreaching. “The lawsuits are already flying,” a Feb. 4 Wall Street Journal editorial noted, “and courts will derail Mr. Musk’s project before it even gets off the ground if he isn’t careful.”\\n\\nOn Capitol Hill, Musk’s assault on the bureaucracy has set up a battle with Democrats that could determine the future of the government and the balance of power within it. “We don’t have a fourth branch of government called Elon Musk,” Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin told a crowd outside USAID on the afternoon of Feb. 3, while the men from DOGE tried to impose their demands inside.\\n\\nRaskin was right. But the agency staffers listening to him on Pennsylvania Avenue, unsure of whether they still had a job, could not tell how much power Musk had acquired, and whether he would bend the other branches of government to his will. One staffer seemed especially skeptical. Yes, she told TIME, the Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse. But Musk had shown his power to yank it away.\\n\\n“There’s only so much Democrats can do,” she said, not wanting to give her name lest it attract more attention from DOGE. Her official email account had been shut down, and she could no longer access her desk at the agency. Like thousands of her colleagues, and millions of Americans, she was left to watch Musk’s moves play out, wondering how far he would go, and what, if anything, could stop him. —With reporting by Eric Cortellessa, Philip Elliott, Nik Popli, and Tessa Berenson Rogers/Washington\"},\n",

Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.” However, there was no mention of resignation in the email sent to employees.\\n\\nTIME has reached out to the White House for comment and clarification.\\n\\nRead More: This Obscure Office Is at the Center of Elon Musk’s Efforts to Harness Federal Data\\n\\nThe OPM email spearheaded by Musk has drawn anger from advocates, unions, and government officials.\\n\\nEverett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), released a statement against the emails.\\n\\n“It is cruel and disrespectful to hundreds of thousands of veterans who are wearing their second uniform in the civil service to be forced to justify their job duties to this out-of-touch, privileged, unelected billionaire,” Kelley said. He went on to add that the AFGE would “challenge any unlawful terminations” of federal employees.\\n\\nDoreen Greenwald, president of the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), which represents employees from 37 different departments and offices, said in a statement that the email “should be called out as completely un-American,” according to CNN.\\n\\n“NTEU’s members are professional civil servants and will not back down to these blatant attempts to attack a vital resource for the American public,” she said.\\n\\nRead More: The Major U.S. Companies Scaling Back DEI Efforts as Trump Targets Initiatives\\n\\nRepublicans have shown varying levels of support and criticism over Musk’s directive. On Sunday’s episode of ABC’s This Week, Republican Rep. Mike Lawler of New York was asked to share his reaction to the email and Musk’s comment that failing to respond would be tantamount to a resignation.\\n\\nLawler said: “I don’t know how that’s necessarily feasible. Obviously, a lot of federal employees are under union contract.”\\n\\nHe then went on to show his support for Musk’s efforts to downsize the government.\\n\\n“There’s no question, as the Department of Government Efficiency moves ahead, what they are seeking to do is ensure that every agency and department is effectively and efficiently doing their job,” Lawler told host Martha Raddatz. “The task at hand for Elon Musk and DOGE, at the direction of President Trump, is to find efficiencies and savings, and make sure that our federal workforce is doing their jobs.\"\\n\\nAlso appearing on This Week, fellow Republican and the former Governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, said that Musk’s survey is a “complete overstep.”\\n\\n“As with everybody’s employment, things vary from week to week,” Christie said. “From a management perspective, you can see what a clown car this is right now.”\\n\\nElon Musk shakes hands with President Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Oct. 5, 2024. Anna Moneymaker—Getty Images\\n\\nMeanwhile, during an appearance on CBS\\' Face the Nation, Utah Republican Senator John Curtis said: \"If I could say one thing to Elon Musk, it\\'s please put a dose of compassion in this. These are real people, real lives, mortgages. It\\'s a false narrative to say we have to cut and we have to be cruel to do it.\"\\n\\nAppearing on the same show, Maryland Democrat Senator Chris Van Hollen also shared his perspective. \"There\\'s no article in the Constitution that gives Elon Musk that authority,\" he said. \"The actions he\\'s taking are illegal, and we need to shut down this illegal operation.\"\\n\\nMusk appeared to address the mounting criticism early Sunday, via posts on X. He stated that the email responses should take “less than 5 mins” and that many “good responses” from employees have already been received. “These are the people who should be considered for promotion,” he said.\\n\\nThe DOGE leader also called the highly-discussed email “a very basic pulse check.” He then proceeded to conduct a poll on his X account, in which he asked: \"Should all federal employees be required to send a short email with some basic bullet points about what they accomplished last week?\" The poll received over 1.2 millions responses, with 70.6% voting yes.\\n\\nMusk\\'s actions came soon after President Trump posted on his own social media platform, Truth Social, on Saturday that Musk should be “more aggressive” in his efforts to downsize the federal government—a goal that has already led to mass layoffs and the ceasing of many government contracts.\\n\\nIn a response sent on X, Musk said of Trump’s feedback: “Will do, Mr. President!”\\n\\nRead More: Kash Patel, Trump’s Pick for FBI Director, Is Confirmed by Senate\\n\\nAccording to an NBC report, Trump’s newly-confirmed FBI Director Kash Patel told FBI employees in an email to “pause any responses” to Musk’s directive, expressing that they will go through their own performance review process.\\n\\n“The FBI, through the Office of the Director, is in charge of all our review processes, and will conduct reviews in accordance with FBI procedures,” the message from Patel reportedly read.\\n\\nAnd Patel is seemingly not alone. Per the New York Times, Tulsi Gabbard, the director of the Office Of National Intelligence, instructed officers in the department not to respond to Musk’s email. Elsewhere, an email said to be from the State Department leadership to its employees had a similar message: that leadership would respond to the OPM email on behalf of the department, and they would evaluate their own employees.\\n\\nDepartment heads from the Pentagon, the IRS, FEMA, and NOAA, are also reportedly seeking guidance before they instruct their employees to respond, according to emails obtained by ABC News.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Federal workers sue Musk over demand they justify their jobs\\n\\nHowever, several agency leaders - including Trump appointees - have pushed back by telling staff not to respond.\\n\\nOPM sent employees an email with the subject: \"What did you do last week?\" It instructed them to provide a list of five achievements, without revealing classified information.\\n\\nThe suit alleges that the email violates laws governing the federal workforce, and it argues that the agency overseeing workers - the Office of Personnel Management - does not have the authority for the demand.\\n\\nA group of unions and advocacy groups filed an updated lawsuit against Elon Musk after federal employees received an email that instructed them to explain their work accomplishments or face being fired.\\n\\nBut Musk maintained on X that he was acting on instructions from President Donald Trump and that a failure to reply to the email by Monday night \"will be taken as a resignation\".\\n\\nThis meant that, like many of Musk\\'s directives, the demand for federal employees to justify their work sparked confusion, anger, and alarm among federal government employees. The differing responses from agency leaders only created greater uncertainty.\\n\\nOver the weekend, thousands of public health workers at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) received a series of conflicting directives regarding the email.\\n\\nThey first received guidance that the instruction was legitimate, and they were told to read and respond to it by Monday, according to an email seen by the BBC.\\n\\nHHS employees then received an update, directing them to \"pause\" activities related to the email. HHS officials were working with the administration\\'s personnel office to comply while being \"mindful\" of the agency\\'s sensitive activities, the new guidance said.\\n\\n\"They\\'re succeeding in driving us insane,\" said one employee who works under HHS, and asked not to be named for fear of retaliation.\\n\\nStaff was still waiting for agency leadership to meet and decide next steps as of Monday, the employee said.\\n\\nSome federal employees said they had contemplated small acts of rebellion, like responding to the email with recent tasks such as answering hate mail and firing their colleagues.\\n\\nThe US Department of Justice, Department of Defense, and Federal Bureau of Investigation have all recommended their staff not respond to the email, which had a Monday night deadline. All are currently run by Trump appointees and loyalists.\\n\\nIn a statement posted to X, Department of Defense official Darin Selnick told staff to \"please pause any response\" to the email.\\n\\n\"The Department of Defense is responsible for reviewing the performance of its personnel and it will conduct any review in accordance with its own procedures,\" the statement said.\\n\\nKash Patel, Donald Trump\\'s new head of the FBI who has railed against federal employees, also issued a similar direction to the agency\\'s staff, but the Department of Transportation directed its employees to follow the email\\'s instructions.\\n\\nThe new lawsuit responding to the email is attached to one filed last week in California, which seeks to block the Trump administration\\'s mass firing of federal workers.\\n\\nThe revised version alleges that \"no OPM rule, regulation, policy, or program has ever, in United States history, purported to require all federal workers to submit reports to OPM\".\\n\\nMajor federal employee unions, including the American Federation of Government Employees, as well as advocacy groups like Vote Vets are part of the lawsuit. A group called the State Democracy Defenders Fund and the California-based Altshuler Berzon law firm represent them.\\n\\nMusk\\'s latest tactic to cull federal employees has raised concerns it could reveal classified information or violate government procedures.\\n\\n\"Federal employees have a duty to ensure that sensitive information, data, and records are only used and disclosed for authorized purposes,\" American Federation of Government Employees president Everett Kelley wrote to OPM leadership.\\n\\nMusk and his Department of Government Efficiency have taken aggressive action to cut down the federal workforce. They have bombarded government employees with emails sent via through OPM, threatening layoffs, offering buyouts with questionable terms, dismissing probationary employees, and ordering managers to make lists of employees to cut.\\n\\nThe efforts have sparked anger from within the federal workforce and a barrage of lawsuits, but this latest order has publicly countered from within agency leadership itself.\\n\\nMax Stier, president of the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, called the email \"yet another example of the new administration\\'s contempt for public servants and public service that will lead to further confusion, anxiety and waste\".\\n\\nTrump\\'s allies have praised the idea of forcing government employees to justify their work.\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s a great idea, you do it in private business all the time,\" Rep Tim Burchett, a Republican from Tennessee, told News Nation. \"You have to have accountability.\"'},\n",

Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images\\n\\nThe Trump administration’s mass email asking federal employees what they worked on last week — and Elon Musk’s announcement that anyone who does not respond will be dismissed — has sent agencies scrambling.\\n\\nSome agencies advised workers to hold off on responding, setting up a showdown with Musk. But other agencies are telling employees to comply, as unions vow legal challenges.\\n\\nWould dismissal be legal? Musk can’t legally force federal employees to resign, and attempting to do so would amount to an involuntary termination, Michael Fallings, a federal employment law expert, told CNN. If workers were affected, they could file a claim challenging the action. Employees should discuss the email with their managers and, if applicable, their union officials before responding, Fallings said.\\n\\nHere’s what officials are telling their workers:\\n\\nLeaders at the Pentagon, Federal Bureau of Investigation, State Department, Department of Homeland Security and Department of Energy all instructed their staff not to reply to an email that federal workers received from the Office of Personnel Management on Saturday afternoon.\\n\\nMultiple senior Defense Department officials told CNN the email thrust their weekend into chaos.\\n\\n“It is the silliest thing I’ve seen in 40 years and completely usurps the chain of command,” one official said. “That might be done elsewhere, but in the DoD it’s not done.”\\n\\nDepartment of Health and Human Services: HHS initially told employees to comply. But the agency later reversed its guidance, telling employees to “pause” their answering of the email.\\n\\nEmployees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, and the Food and Drug Administration, which are part of HHS, were told by individual agencies to wait until Monday for more guidance.\\n\\nNASA is working to issue guidance on how employees should respond, after initially asking workers to comply.\\n\\nWorkers at the Social Security Administration and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau were told to comply.\\n\\nMany employees at the CFPB, which the Trump administration is hoping to dismantle, were told to stop working earlier this month. The Sunday email said: “If you were not able to perform tasks/work… you may reply and simply reference that you were complying with the current work stoppage.”\\n\\nEmployees from the National Transportation Safety Board — tasked with investigating an unprecedented string of air disasters over the last month — have also been asked to justify what they did on the job last week. It’s not clear how the NTSB staff will be directed to respond. The deadline to respond is 11:59 p.m. EST on Monday.\\n\\nRead more about how agencies are responding.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'New York CNN —\\n\\nStarbucks announced Monday it will lay off over 1,000 corporate workers and cut complex and unpopular drinks from its menu in an effort to turn around lagging sales and revamp the coffee chain.\\n\\nStarbucks is cutting some Frappuccino blended drinks, Royal English Breakfast Latte and White Hot Chocolate as part of its effort to simplify operations and shrink its menu.\\n\\n“These items aren’t commonly purchased, can be complex to make, or are like other beverages on our menu,” the company said in a release announcing the menu change.\\n\\nStarbucks is cutting 30% of its menu in an effort to simplify its processes. Starbucks’ iced energy drinks and its controversial olive oil coffees have already been removed from menus. Other retailers and restaurants are also cutting choices to reduce costs and focus on selling their most profitable items.\\n\\nStarbucks’ sales have slipped for four straight quarters, the longest decline in years. Some customers stopped going to Starbucks because of high prices for drinks and long wait times, and hundreds of its stores have voted to unionize in protest of pay, benefits and working conditions. More than 30% of Starbucks’ orders now come from customers ordering off their phones and picking them up. This influx of mobile orders has sometimes strained Starbucks workers during rush hours.\\n\\nStarbucks also said Monday that it’s cutting around 1,100 corporate jobs.\\n\\nThe company added that it would be eliminating “several hundred” open and unfilled positions, as well as requiring those who are at vice president levels or higher to come into its Seattle or Toronto offices at least three times a week.\\n\\nThe company is attempting a turnaround under new CEO Brian Niccol.\\n\\nNiccol, who was brought in from Chipotle in August 2024 and is the company’s fourth CEO in two years, has embarked on an ambitious turnaround plan for the coffee chain.

       "   'content': \"LOADING ERROR LOADING\\n\\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Key U.S. agencies, including the FBI, State Department and the Pentagon, have instructed their employees not to comply with cost-cutting chief Elon Musk’s latest demand that federal workers explain what they accomplished last week — or risk losing their job.\\n\\nThe pushback from appointees of President Donald Trump marked a new level of chaos and confusion within the beleaguered federal workforce, just a month after Trump returned to the White House and quickly began fulfilling campaign promises to shrink the government.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdministration officials scrambled throughout the weekend to interpret Musk’s unusual mandate, which apparently has Trump’s backing despite some lawmakers arguing it is illegal. Unions want the administration to rescind the request and are threatening to sue.\\n\\nSome officials are resisting. Others are encouraging their workers to comply. At some agencies, there was conflicting guidance.\\n\\nOne message on Sunday morning from the Department of Health and Human Services, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., instructed its roughly 80,000 employees to comply. That was shortly after the acting general counsel, Sean Keveney, had instructed some not to. And by Sunday evening, agency leadership issued new instructions that employees should “pause activities” on the request until noon Monday.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“I’ll be candid with you. Having put in over 70 hours of work last week advancing Administration’s priorities, I was personally insulted to receive the below email,” Keveney said in an email viewed by The Associated Press.\\n\\nKeveney laid out security concerns and pointed out some of the work done by the agency’s employees may be protected by attorney-client privilege: “I have received no assurances that there are appropriate protections in place to safeguard responses to this email.”\\n\\nMusk’s team sent an email to federal employees on Saturday giving them roughly 48 hours to report five specific things they had accomplished last week. In a separate message on X, Musk said any employee who failed to respond by the deadline — set in the email as 11:59 p.m. EST Monday — would lose their job.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nPushback to Musk’s demand\\n\\nDemocrats and even some Republicans were critical of Musk’s ultimatum, which came just hours after Trump encouraged him on social media to “get more aggressive” in reducing the size of the government through his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\\n\\nSen. John Curtis, R-Utah, was among the members of Trump’s party who had concerns.\\n\\n“If I could say one thing to Elon Musk, it’s like, please put a dose of compassion in this,” Curtis, whose state has 33,000 federal employees, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “These are real people. These are real lives. These are mortgages. ... It’s a false narrative to say we have to cut and you have to be cruel to do it as well.”\\n\\nOn ABC’s “This Week,” Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., questioned the legal basis the Trump administration would have for dismissing tens of thousands of workers for refusing to heed Musk’s latest demand. The email did not include the threat about workers losing their jobs.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFor Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., there was no doubt: “The actions he’s taking are illegal,” he said on “Face the Nation.”\\n\\nTrump mocked the affected workers in a meme Sunday on his social media network. The post featured a cartoon character writing a list of accomplishments from the previous week led by, “Cried about Trump,” “Cried about Elon,” “Made it into the office for once,” and “Read some emails.”\\n\\nSome federal agencies aren’t complying\\n\\nNewly confirmed FBI Director Kash Patel, an outspoken Trump ally, instructed bureau employees to ignore Musk’s request, at least for now.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“The FBI, through the Office of the Director, is in charge of all of our review processes, and will conduct reviews in accordance with FBI procedures,” Patel wrote in an email confirmed by the AP. “When and if further information is required, we will coordinate the responses. For now, please pause any responses.”\\n\\nEd Martin, the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, sent his staff a message Sunday that may cause more confusion. Martin noted that he responded to Musk’s order.\\n\\n“Let me clarify: We will comply with this OPM request whether by replying or deciding not to reply,” Martin wrote in the email obtained by the AP, referring to the Office of Personnel Management.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“Please make a good faith effort to reply and list your activities (or not, as you prefer), and I will, as I mentioned, have your back regarding any confusion,” Martin continued. “We can do this.”\\n\\nThe night before, Martin had instructed staff to comply. “DOGE and Elon are doing great work. Historic. We are happy to participate,” Martin wrote at that time.\\n\\nOfficials at the Departments of State, Defense and Homeland Security were more consistent.\\n\\nTibor Nagy, acting undersecretary of state for management, told employees in an email that department leadership would respond on behalf of workers.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“No employee is obligated to report their activities outside of their Department chain of command,” Nagy wrote in an email.\\n\\nPentagon leadership instructed employees to “pause” any response to Musk’s team as well.\\n\\n“The Department of Defense is responsible for reviewing the performance of its personnel and it will conduct any review in accordance with its own procedures,” according to an email from Jules Hurst, deputy undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness. “When and if required, the Department will coordinate responses.”\\n\\nThe Homeland Security Department told employees that “no reporting action from you is needed at this time” and that agency managers would respond, according to an email from R.D. Alles, deputy undersecretary for management.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nJob cuts across the government\\n\\nEverett Kelley, president of the 800,000-member American Federation of Government Employees, said in a letter Sunday to the administration that it should rescind Musk’s request and apologize to all federal workers by the end of the day.\\n\\n“We believe that employees have no obligation to respond to this plainly unlawful email absent other lawful direction,” he wrote, describing Musk as “unelected and unhinged.”\\n\\nThousands of government employees have already been forced out of the federal workforce — either by being fired or through a “deferred resignation” offer. There is no official figure available for the total firings or layoffs so far, but the AP has tallied hundreds of thousands of workers who are being affected.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMusk on Sunday called his latest request “a very basic pulse check.”\\n\\n“The reason this matters is that a significant number of people who are supposed to be working for the government are doing so little work that they are not checking their email at all!” Musk wrote on X. “In some cases, we believe non-existent people or the identities of dead people are being used to collect paychecks. In other words, there is outright fraud.”\\n\\nHe has provided no evidence of such fraud. Separately, Musk and Trump have falsely claimed in recent days that tens of millions of dead people over 100 years old are receiving Social Security payments.\\n\\nGo Ad-Free — And Protect The Free Press The next four years will change America forever.

Most notably, legislators have stood by as the administration usurped Congress’ power of the purse, refused to spend billions of dollars of appropriated funds, and let Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency dismantle entire agencies without any pretense of legal authority.\\n\\nNow some Republican members of Congress, facing growing public outcry over their inactivity, are eager to demonstrate that they take seriously their responsibilities to check the executive branch and, to paraphrase Federalist 51, counteract ambition with ambition. One way they will attempt to do that is by turning to a fairly obscure law called the Congressional Review Act.\\n\\nCongressional Republicans have to act fast, since the CRA puts a time limit on these procedures.\\n\\nWhile the Constitution establishes the minimal requirements for how a bill becomes a law, Congress has added its own procedural hurdles — notably the Senate’s 60-vote “filibuster” requirement for moving to a final vote. The CRA creates a special form of legislation called a “resolution of disapproval” that gets a free pass through these hurdles. But it can only be used for one purpose: to repeal a recently issued agency rule — say, a new pollution standard from the Environmental Protection Agency. If Congress repeals a rule using the CRA, the law also bars the agency from issuing a “substantially” similar replacement.\\n\\nThe CRA derives much of its power from its “lookback” provision. Under ordinary circumstances, presidents won’t sign into law bills that repeal their own rules. The lookback provision creates a mechanism for a new president to sign off on resolutions for rules that were released late in their predecessor’s administration. If that president happens to be from a different party, they will likely be happy to work with Congress to repeal those late-issued rules using the CRA.\\n\\nBut congressional Republicans have to act fast, since the CRA puts a time limit on these procedures. The exact length of time depends on Congress’ schedule and other factors, but is likely to run out in mid-May.\\n\\nIt’s tempting to interpret the aggressive use of the CRA as Congress asserting its position as the main policymaking body within our constitutional framework. This perspective would also mean that congressional Democrats’ criticisms of the CRA put party politics ahead of checks and balances.\\n\\nThat interpretation would be mistaken. The CRA is a fake expression of congressional power; even worse, it hobbles legitimate efforts at leveraging the powers the Constitution already gives the legislature to check the executive branch.\\n\\nThe bitter partisanship that now prevails leaves the first branch too debilitated to defend its institutional prerogatives against presidential encroachment.\\n\\nRecall from above that the CRA doesn’t give Congress new powers. Congress has always had the duty and responsibility of ensuring that any authorities it grants to the executive are used properly. That includes taking away authorities that aren’t used properly, as was the case, most famously, with airline industry deregulation in the 1970s. The only thing stopping Congress from doing so is, well, Congress.\\n\\nOne reason they are not doing so is that lawmaking via regular order has become too difficult. The bitter partisanship that now prevails leaves the first branch too debilitated to defend its institutional prerogatives against presidential encroachment. Thus, legislative gimmicks like the CRA, which cut through those hurdles, are increasingly attractive. Precisely because the CRA facilitates voting along party lines, its aggressive use risks reinforcing this disabling polarization.\\n\\nBut the CRA’s fundamental flaw is what it doesn’t do: By design, CRA resolutions offer the executive branch no substantive guidance on what the vetoed regulation should have looked like instead. Only by offering such guidance can Congress reassert its primacy in policymaking, as our Constitution envisions. Yet, because the CRA offers lawmakers a way to score easy — albeit superficial — wins, it disincentivizes them from taking just these kinds of steps.\\n\\nThe CRA could strengthen Congress as an institution — but it would need to be drastically reformed. For instance, an improved CRA could require sponsors of a resolution to identify specific objections to the targeted rule and articulate criteria for a replacement. And instead of barring a replacement rule that is too similar, the resolution should require the agency to issue a replacement within a set time frame, such as two years from the resolution becoming law. If the sponsor doesn’t want a replacement, they would have to give evidence-based reasons for why none is needed, such as the problem addressed by the rule no longer exists or other mechanisms can fix the problem better.\\n\\nAn effective Congress is possible. But its members need the right legislative tools. The CRA is not one of these.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Trump’s accidental firings continue\\n\\nAs Elon Musk continues to try to take a chainsaw to the federal government, the billionaire seems to be having a hard time keeping track of whom he is actually firing. And the leaders of the gutted agencies will be forced to clean up his mess.\\n\\nLast week, 950 employees working for the Indian Health Service were laid off, only to be told hours later that new Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had “verbally rescinded” their firing.\\n\\nThis week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture “accidentally” fired several employees working on the country’s bird flu prevention response. As of Friday afternoon, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had confirmed 70 human cases of bird flu in the U.S. and egg prices are soaring.\\n\\nThe USDA insists it’s “working swiftly” to rehire the fired workers. Consider me skeptical.\\n\\nBecause we’ve seen this movie before. Just last week, the National Nuclear Security Administration mistakenly fired employees and then couldn’t figure out how to contact them because they hadn’t collected personal contact information.\\n\\nAnd let’s not forget the Small Business Administration, where the Trump administration fired probationary employees, then told them their termination was a mistake, only to turn around the next day and fire them again.\\n\\nA story you should be following: Musk’s money in Wisconsin\\n\\nMusk has already spent hundreds of millions of dollars helping to elect President Donald Trump and Republican House candidates. Now, as I discussed with Wisconsin state Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler, a nonprofit he funds has poured $1.6 million into a crucial Wisconsin Supreme Court race.\\n\\nHere’s why it matters: Wisconsin’s Supreme Court currently has a 4-3 liberal majority. But with a liberal judge retiring, that balance is at stake. If conservative candidate Brad Schimel wins on April 1, Republicans will gain control of the court and the power to potentially roll back abortion rights, weaken labor protections and undermine voting rights in a crucial swing state.\\n\\nMusk’s group is using the same deceptive playbook we saw in 2024. Last election, Building America’s Future funded misleading and contradictory ads about Kamala Harris’ stance on Israel, sending different, targeted messages to Arab American and Jewish voters. It also ran Facebook ads designed to look as if they came from Democrats and falsely claimed Harris supported banning all gas-powered cars.\\n\\nWisconsin’s last off-year judicial election, in 2023, broke national spending records, with $51 million spent in total. At the current rate, this election’s ad buys could blow that record out of the water.\\n\\nThe GOP’s Russia reset\\n\\nFor years, Republican senators positioned themselves as staunch defenders of Ukraine — even Sen. Mitch McConnell — calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a “war criminal” and warning that failing to stand up to Russia would embolden dictators worldwide. But now, as Trump openly cozies up to Putin and pursues backdoor deals, many of these same Republicans have gone quiet — or worse, are suddenly on board.\\n\\nSen. Lindsey Graham\\n\\nThen: In 2022, Graham called Putin a “thug” and compared him to Adolf Hitler. He even warned that Putin was “a war criminal that needs to be dealt with.”\\n\\nNow: Graham has praised Trump’s approach and voiced support for a deal Trump proposed that would grant the United States a 50% stake in all of Ukraine’s rare earth mineral resources in exchange for U.S. support.\\n\\nSen. Tom Cotton\\n\\nThen: In 2022, Cotton warned that letting Putin invade Ukraine would embolden China’s Xi Jinping to invade Taiwan.\\n\\nNow: Cotton has echoed claims accusing former President Joe Biden of “tempting” Russia to invade and echoed Graham’s support for a deal tied to Ukrainian mineral resources.\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune\\n\\nThen: In 2024, Thune noted “America cannot retreat from the world stage” and warned Russia would invade other European countries in addition to Ukraine if we allowed Putin to be successful.\\n\\nNow: Thune has changed his tune, claiming the conflict has “dragged on” and we need to “bring an end to the war.”\\n\\nTune in to Episodes 5 and 6 of “The Blueprint with Jen Psaki” on Monday\\n\\nA huge thank-you to everyone who’s already tuned in to my new podcast, “The Blueprint with Jen Psaki.” On Monday, don’t miss our new episodes with Illinois Gov.

       "   'content': 'WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Monday embraced Elon Musk\\'s ultimatum demanding that federal workers report what they had accomplished last week or lose their jobs, a directive facing pushback from unions and some agencies leading up to a midnight deadline to respond.\\n\\n\"I thought it was great,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, where he was meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron.\\n\\n\"We have people that don’t show up to work and nobody even knows if they work for the government so by asking the question ‘tell us what you did this week,’ what he\\'s doing is saying are you actually working. And then, if you don’t answer, like, you’re sort of semi-fired or you\\'re fired,\" he said, adding \"a lot of people are not answering because they don\\'t even exist.\"\\n\\n\"There was a lot of genius in sending it,\" Trump said. \"If people don’t respond, it’s very possible that there is no such person or they’re not working.”\\n\\nA coalition of unions and groups that have been fighting the Trump administration\\'s mass layoffs of probationary workers charge the effort was unlawful. They amended their lawsuit against the U.S. Office of Personnel Management over the weekend to add a claim involving the OPM email directing workers to justify their workweek.\\n\\nThe OPM emails were sent out Saturday, shortly after Musk wrote in a post on X that \"all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week. Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.\"\\n\\nThe OPM email did not mention the resignation threat, but said: \"Please reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager. Please do not send any classified information, links, or attachments. Deadline is this Monday at 11:59pm EST.\"\\n\\nThe lawsuit charges that the administration didn\\'t follow proper procedure for such an order and should be voided by a judge.\\n\\n\"The mass firings ordered by OPM are illegal and betray the trust of countless federal employees. The patronizing demand that federal workers still on the job have to justify themselves by enumerating five accomplishments just adds insult to injury. That too is against the law,\" lawyer Norm Eisen said in a statement on behalf of the plaintiffs.\\n\\nMusk has been tasked by Trump with reducing the size of the government, and the email is seen as part of his push to reduce the federal workforce by as much as 10 percent.\\n\\nSome agencies, including ones led by close Trump allies, have told their employees to ignore the directive.\\n\\nJustice Department employees were informed Monday that they did not need to respond to the message, according to emails seen by NBC News. “Due to the confidential and sensitive nature of the Department’s work, DOJ employees do not need to respond to the email from OPM. If you have already responded to this email, no further action is needed,” read one email sent by Assistant Attorney General for Administration Jolene Ann Lauria.\\n\\nFBI Director Kash Patel instructed employees over the weekend to “pause any responses” to the email, and said his agency would do its own review. Employees of the State Department, the National Institutes of Health, the Defense Department, the National Security Agency and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence were also told not to respond to the email.\\n\\nThe Department of Agriculture also sent out an unsigned email to employees informing them that any response to the email \"is voluntary and not required.\"\\n\\nThe email was also sent to an unknown amount of judicial branch employees, including judges and court staffers. Spokespeople for federal courts in Manhattan and the Northern District of Illinois confirmed to NBC News that “some” people had gotten the message.\\n\\nJulie Hodek, a spokesperson for the Northern District of Illinois, also confirmed the email and said the court’s chief judge and clerk “communicated with the staff that as we are judiciary employees, our policies and procedures are governed by the Judicial Conference of the United States and our local court HR handbooks.”\\n\\nOfficials at the Health and Human Services Department and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services directed employees to respond by the deadline\\n\\nAn email sent to Department of Transportation employees and obtained by NBC News instructed them to respond to OPM’s weekend email asking for five bullet points of their work. The message also asked employees to exclude any classified info from their responses. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy embraced the challenge himself in a post on social media.\\n\\nMusk appears to be following the same playbook he used when he bought Twitter, which he renamed X.\\n\\nMusk began his tenure there with massive layoffs, asking employees to commit to \"Extremely hardcore\" work in an email titled \"A Fork in the Road\" or be fired. The email subject line is the same as the email sent out to federal employees by the Office of Personnel Management offering buyouts in January. About 75,000 federal employees took the deal.\\n\\nTwitter employees who stayed were then asked to print out pages of code they\\'d written from the last month and prepare to present the work to Musk personally. The code reviews reportedly were abandoned, and instead, managers were asked to rank their employees, according to The Verge.\\n\\nMusk and DOGE\\'s access to government data and information has become a central point of friction between the group and its critics. In at least 11 lawsuits, plaintiffs have argued that DOGE has flouted laws and rules around data and privacy. Some of the lawsuits have referenced allegations that DOGE is using artificial intelligence to analyze and process government data. The Washington Post reported in February that DOGE was using artificial intelligence to analyze spending at the Education Department, citing two people familiar with the project.'},\n",

While technically applying only to the plaintiffs, the ruling in effect creates a broad ban on Doge’s access to personal data, including social security numbers, tax information and other sensitive records.\\n\\nAt the heart of the ruling is the determination that the government failed to demonstrate why Doge staffers needed access to this information. The court focused on the legal requirement that officials must have a “need-to-know” basis for accessing sensitive records – a standard Boardman ruled the government had not met.\\n\\nThe decision represents the most wide-ranging judicial check yet on Doge’s activities since its creation through a January executive order. And it follows another court order from New York that has already blocked Doge personnel from accessing treasury department payment databases.\\n\\nThe ruling hampers the job-cutting initiatives Trump has entrusted to Musk, including the billionaire businessman’s weekend message to federal workers demanding they detail their previous week’s work or be deemed to have resigned.

       "   'content': 'More than 150,000 people from Canada have signed a parliamentary petition calling for their country to strip Elon Musk’s Canadian citizenship because of the tech billionaire’s alliance with Donald Trump, who has spent his second US presidency repeatedly threatening to conquer its independent neighbor to the north and turn it into its 51st state.\\n\\nThe British Columbia author Qualia Reed launched the petition in Canada’s House of Commons, where it was sponsored by New Democrat parliamentary member and avowed Musk critic Charlie Angus, as the Canadian Press first reported over the weekend.\\n\\nBorn in South Africa and owning US companies including electric vehicle-maker Tesla, aerospace company SpaceX and the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Musk has Canadian citizenship through his mother: model and dietitian Maye Musk, who is from Saskatchewan’s capital, Regina. He has been crusading to slash the US federal government’s size at the behest of the US president, who has consistently challenged Canada’s sovereignty since returning to the White House for a second presidential term on 20 January.\\n\\nReed’s petition – filed on 20 February – accuses Musk of having “engaged in activities that go against the national interest of Canada” by acting as an adviser to Trump. Trump has invited the scorn of Canada’s 40 million residents by making threats about imposing steep tariffs on Canadian products and openly boasting about having the US annex the country, including shortly before its national hockey team defeated a selection of American opponents in a politically charged 20 February tournament final.\\n\\nThe petition asserts that Musk’s alignment with Trump makes him “a member of a foreign government that is attempting to erase Canadian sovereignty”. It asks the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to take away Musk’s Canadian passport and revoke his citizenship with immediate effect.\\n\\nTrump has often mocked Trudeau as “governor”, the title given to US states’ chief executives. And Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he bought in 2022 for $44bn to relish Trudeau’s announcement in January that he would resign as the head of Canada’s Liberal party after it selected a new leader, with the tech billionaire praising clips of the prominent Canadian Conservative party chief Pierre Poilievre.\\n\\nAs the Canadian Press noted, petitions like Reed’s require 500 or more signatures for them to gain the certification necessary to be presented to Canada’s House of Commons and potentially garner a formal government response. Reed’s petition evidently had no trouble clearing that threshold, having collected about 167,000 signatures as of early Monday, with no indication that the number would soon stop rising.\\n\\nCanada’s House of Commons is scheduled to resume its work on 24 March, though the country could call for a general election before parliamentary members return. The signing period for Reed’s petition was set to expire on 20 June.\\n\\nMusk’s directive to ostensibly cut federal spending – after Trump lost re-election in 2020 to Joe Biden but then secured it in November at the expense of Kamala Harris – has affected hundreds of thousands of US government civil servants. The cuts include thousands at the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Defense, Health and Human Services, the Internal Revenue Service and the National Parks Service, among others.\\n\\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Over the weekend, a coalition of groups opposed to the mass layoffs asked a court to prevent reprisals against employees who fail to reply by the deadline of Monday at midnight.\\n\\n“This request, and the resulting confusion, is not just inappropriate – it is disruptive to essential government functions,” wrote Everett Kelley, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit originally filed to stop the mass firings of probationary workers.\\n\\nSeveral federal departments have reportedly told their employees not to respond to the email, which was sent from the office of personnel management (OPM), one of the first federal organs Musk and his team on the so-called “department of government efficiency” infiltrated after Trump was sworn in.\\n\\nLongtime federal workers have also spoken out against the unusual demand, with one unnamed defense department official criticizing the scheme to CNN as “the silliest thing I’ve seen in 40 years”.\\n\\nThat prompted Musk to retort “anyone with the attitude of that Pentagon official needs to look for a new job”.\\n\\nMusk’s ultimatum was sent out on Saturday in a mass email to federal employees from OPM, and gave all the US government’s more than 2 million workers barely 48 hours to itemize their accomplishments in the past week in five bullet points.\\n\\nIn a separate message, Musk indicated that “failure to respond will be taken as a resignation”.\\n\\nThe order provoked instant chaos across the government, with Trump’s own appointed leadership in federal agencies responding in starkly different ways. Workers in the Social Security Administration and the health and human services department were told to comply with the email.\\n\\nCNN reported that the Department of Transportation ordered all its employees to respond to the Musk email by the deadline of Monday at midnight. That included air traffic controllers who are currently struggling with severe understaffing and a spate of recent accidents.\\n\\nBy contrast, employees in other federal departments were told to await further orders or to simply ignore Musk’s edict.\\n\\nThe new director of the FBI, the Trump loyalist Kash Patel, told agents to “please pause any responses”. Employees with the homeland security department were similarly informed that “no reporting action from you is needed at this time”.\\n\\nDespite Musk’s retort to the anonymous Pentagon official, all employees at the Department of Defense, who now answer to the former Fox News host and Trump acolyte Pete Hegseth as defense secretary, were also told to pause responding to the OPM missive.\\n\\nAt least 20,000 federal workers have so far been fired by the Trump administration, most of them recent hires on probationary periods who lack employment protections. In addition, the White House claims that more than 75,000 employees have accepted a buyout.\\n\\nThe purge has prompted speculation that Trump is engaging in one of the biggest job cutting rounds in US history, which could have a powerful knock-on effect on the American economy.'},\n",

       "   'title': 'What Elon Musk Got Wrong About Why Federal Retirement Is Still Managed out of a Limestone Mine',\n",
       "   'time': '2025-02-22T10:00:00',\n",
       "   'content': \"Elon Musk asserted last week that before any US federal employee can retire, their paper records have to be processed more than 200 feet underground in an old limestone mine located in rural Pennsylvania, which he said often takes months. “And then the speed—the limiting factor is the speed—at which the mine-shaft elevator can move determines how many people can retire from the federal government,” Musk said, standing next to a seated President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. “And the elevator breaks down sometimes, and then nobody can retire—doesn’t that sound crazy?”\\n\\nWhile Musk’s comment about elevator dependency is overstated—the mine has many entrances and exits, as well as a road leading in and out that golf carts and other vehicles can drive on—his general point about inefficiencies within the federal retirement process is true. The Office of Personnel Management, which functions as the human resources department of the US government, tells retirees to expect a three- to five-month wait to process their applications. And retirement paperwork for federal employees does route through a storage facility in a repurposed limestone mine in rural Boyers, about 50 miles north of Pittsburgh.\\n\\nWhen the system at Boyers was first established decades ago, putting retiree archives and processing files under one roof that was both remote and secure made a lot of sense. But over time, a systematic lack of resources, combined with repeated failed attempts to automate and digitize, created the “sinkhole of bureaucracy” that is the federal retirement hub today.\\n\\nSix years ago, the Government Accountability Office reported that the OPM’s retirement system was still plagued by a “continuing reliance on paper-based applications and manual processing.” The agency's average retirement file processing time was about 60 days in 2019, which is only a modest decrease from 1981, when it took 98 days, but the agency processed almost twice as many applications.\\n\\nBut David Carmicheal, who recently retired as state archivist of Pennsylvania and has corresponded with staff at the Boyers facility, tells WIRED it’s a mistake to only view OPM’s process as “woefully outdated.”\\n\\n“Much of the work that goes on at Boyers, as I understand it, is digital, so the idea of people trundling piles of paper through dark mine shafts is absurd,” Carmicheal says. “In fact, these facilities are meant to protect you and me by protecting the records that safeguard our legal rights, our public benefits.”\\n\\nWhen reached for comment, the Government Accountability Office referred WIRED to its most recent publications. The Office of Personnel Management did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nGoing Underground\\n\\nThe Civil Service Commission, the predecessor of the OPM, started mailing retirement files to Boyers in 1960 with the intent to archive them “forever.” The CSC was one of many agencies that took advantage of repurposed mines and caves during the Cold War, seeking enhanced protection for sensitive materials in the event of a nuclear catastrophe.\\n\\nThe Boyers mine was operational from 1902 to roughly 1959 under the helm of US Steel. When high operating costs and dwindling demand for limestone caused the business to decline in the 1950s, US Steel employee Larry Yont saw an opportunity to repurpose the site as a storage facility and, with the help of civil engineer and mine superintendent Russell Mitchell, went on to found National Underground Storage. It was later bought by the company Iron Mountain in 1998, which owns and leases the Boyers mine to this day.\"},\n",

       "   'content': \"Elon Musk is once again leaving his fingerprints on official communications from the federal government. In an email to staff Saturday afternoon, the Office of Personnel Management, which is stacked with Musk loyalists, told employees to send five bullet points detailing what they accomplished last week and cc their manager. “Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation,” Musk wrote on X.\\n\\nThe move comes after President Trump announced that he wants Musk to be more forceful. “ELON IS DOING A GREAT JOB, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM GET MORE AGGRESSIVE,” he wrote on Truth Social. “REMEMBER, WE HAVE A COUNTRY TO SAVE, BUT ULTIMATELY, TO MAKE GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. MAGA!”\\n\\n“Will do, Mr. President!” Musk replied in a post on X.\\n\\nThe memo, which closely resembles a note Musk sent to Twitter staff in June 2023, specifies that employees should not include classified information, links, or attachments in their responses. WIRED has confirmed that employees at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service, National Institutes of Health, and Federal Aviation Administration, which all deal in classified information, received similar notices. The deadline to reply is Monday at 11:59pm EST.\\n\\n“They’re proving that their only goal is not efficiency but to dismantle democracy by traumatizing federal workers,” says a current federal employee who asked to remain anonymous as they aren’t authorized to speak publicly about their agency. “They see this as a video game where they level up every time they hurt or eliminate a federal worker.”\\n\\nIn recent weeks, the Trump administration has laid off thousands of probationary employees who’ve been in the federal government for just one or two years. The cuts initially hit hundreds of people working on nuclear security as well as veterans and Department of Agriculture employees who are trying to stave off a bird flu pandemic. The so-called Department of Government Efficiency has also effectively frozen or otherwise attempted to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\\n\\nIt is not clear whether OPM has the authority to force federal workers to resign if they do not respond to the email. “I don't know that anybody can assess what’s legal right now because the agencies that are supposed to act as watchdogs are being dismantled,” says Laurie Burgess, an attorney who has represented a number of Twitter and SpaceX employees in labor disputes. She noted that she has cases set to be heard before the National Labor Relations Board this spring and does not feel confident that the board will still exist by that deadline.\\n\\nIn January, OPM sent federal workers an email with the subject line “Fork in the Road,” mirroring a note Musk sent to Twitter staff in November 2022. OPM told employees to return to the office five days a week, and that the government will employ people who are “reliable, loyal, trustworthy, and who strive for excellence.” Those who did not wish to comply were given a deferred resignation offer, which the White House has said that about 75,000 federal workers accepted.\"},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-23T03:31:35',\n",
       "   'content': 'On Saturday, employees throughout the federal government received an email from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), demanding a reply with “approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week.” On X, Elon Musk posted that failure to respond “will be taken as a resignation.” The result? Confusion, chaos, and resentment among a federal workforce that increasingly feels under attack.\\n\\n“So fucking dumb,” says one air traffic controller who received the email and was granted anonymity for fear of retribution. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents ATC personnel, told its members not to respond until Federal Aviation Administration leadership provided guidance.\\n\\nLeaders of many agencies appear to have been caught off guard. At the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which houses the National Weather Service, some managers initially cautioned against replying to the email in case it was a phishing attempt. Another NOAA employee says they were cautioned not to log on to their work email after receiving it.\\n\\nOther workers were met with conflicting guidance from their managers. At the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which is anticipating deep cuts orchestrated by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), some employees reported being told to await further guidance while others say their managers instructed people to comply.\\n\\nThe email appears to have been sent even to federal judges. “We understand that some judges and judiciary staff have received an email from HR@opm.gov,” read an email from the director’s office of the Department of Administrative Services for US Federal Courts. “Please be advised that this email did not originate from the Judiciary or the Administrative Office and we suggest that no action be taken.”\\n\\nAt least some military personnel also received the email and have been told to await guidance from the Department of Defense. That holding pattern appears to be the response at most agencies, where workers say they have not heard from senior leadership if and how they should handle this latest escalation in Musk and DOGE’s ongoing efforts to dramatically reduce the federal workforce. At the National Institutes of Health, for instance, in an email with the subject line “Please Await Guidance,” some workers were told that “information is forthcoming,” without any indication of when or from whom.\\n\\nAnother consideration for many is not only whether they should reply but how. While the OPM email specified that employees should not send classified information, links, or attachments, that severely limits how workers at many government agencies might be able to respond.\\n\\n“National security staff are getting notified of OPM’s request, which is taking them from the important work of ensuring national security interests,” said one source, who was granted anonymity due to the nature of their work. “These are essential employees who keep us safe.”\\n\\n“The Executive Committee is currently reviewing this request to determine appropriate guidelines regarding what information can be shared outside of the agency,” reads an email from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which sits within the Treasury Department. “Please wait for additional guidance.”'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-24T17:10:17',\n",
       "   'content': 'On Saturday, Elon Musk, the billionaire charged by President Donald Trump with cutting government waste, alerted the public to a massive inefficiency in the federal bureaucracy: Government employees would soon be distracted from their actual work by a request from on high. In aggregate, hundreds of thousands of man-hours would be squandered. But Musk wasn’t putting a stop to this wasteful time suck of a requirement. He was the one imposing it.\\n\\n“All federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,” Musk posted around noon on his social-media platform, X. “Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.” Soon afterward, the Office of Personnel Management sent such an email to all federal agencies. The subject line: “What did you do last week?” Workers were told to respond by tonight with five bullet points “of what you accomplished.”\\n\\nAs someone who hates government waste, I sympathize with any Americans who are cheering this initiative because they believe it will expose workers who accomplish nothing. But those Americans are cheering, albeit unwittingly, for massive inefficiency—just the latest example of the chaos DOGE has created across the federal government, undercutting its own aims.\\n\\nJonathan Rauch: One word describes Trump\\n\\nConsider America’s roughly 14,000 Federal Aviation Administration air-traffic controllers. If each of them spends just 10 minutes opening their work email, finding this request, drafting a response, proofreading it, and sending it off, that adds up to 2,333 hours of work. Can you think of a more cartoonish example of government waste than using 292 workdays’ worth of man-hours to clarify that, last week, air-traffic controllers monitored airplanes?\\n\\nI actually can think of a more cartoonish example, in that it is even bigger in scale: Some 74,000 U.S. Postal Service letter carriers deliver mail on foot, making roughly $29 an hour on average. If they spend 10 minutes each, or 740,000 total minutes, drafting emails, that works out to nearly $360,000 in labor costs. For what? And how long will it take other workers to read “I was delivering letters” 74,000 times?\\n\\nAny American can identify many more categories of federal employees whose job duties are known to all. We know what TSA agents do. We know what nurses do. An efficient process would obviously exempt all such categories.\\n\\nOther federal employees of course have less legible job duties, and I do not doubt that some of them accomplished next to nothing of value last week and ought to be fired. But there is no reason to believe that any of those employees will be truthful about their own uselessness, or that untruthful emails will be detected as such. This gambit is more likely to reward bullshitting persuasively via email than actual service to taxpayers.\\n\\nThe effect of Musk’s order on other Trump-administration leaders adds to its costs. Various news outlets have reported that officials at multiple agencies—including the Departments of Defense, State, and Homeland Security; the FBI; and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence—instructed their employees not to respond to the email, in part out of worry that employees would have to share sensitive information. Put another way, people charged with keeping Americans safe had to spend time and attention preempting a potential security risk that Musk introduced rather than attending to other dangers.\\n\\nOn X, Musk has made various attempts to defend his initiative. They only intensified my doubts. “The passing grade is literally just ‘Can you send an email with words that make any sense at all?’” Musk wrote. “It’s a low bar.” Even the most worthless bureaucrats can clear that bar. So why set it? Meanwhile, as The Washington Post reported, “some federal workers were on leave … and unable to access their emails. Others, in the Defense Department, were on duty tours in remote locations, like jungles, without access to computers.” In other words, some valuable federal employees will fail to clear the bar through no fault of their own.\\n\\nDonald Moynihan: The DOGE project will backfire\\n\\n“The reason this matters is that a significant number of people who are supposed to be working for the government are doing so little work that they are not checking their email at all!” Musk also wrote, as if checking email is a reliable measure of productivity in all public-sector jobs. If you’re a NASA employee doing maintenance on a remote telescope, or a Department of Labor employee traveling to far-flung coal mines to assess their safety, or a Coast Guard employee patrolling a patch of ocean, or an NSA employee trying to hack the personal device of a foreign general, checking email irregularly could as easily show that you’re working hard as that you’re hardly working.\\n\\nPlus, if the idea is to catch folks who don’t check email at all, wouldn’t publicizing the gambit on X undermine that strategy by alerting those workers to it? So much of what Musk says about this matter doesn’t make any sense, even on its own terms. One X user posted a screenshot of a cheeky prompt for Grok, the Musk-generated AI chatbot: “Make up 5 things I accomplished at work this week that they can’t really verify, I work for the government, keep it brief.” Grok generated five items, illustrating how easy it is to game Musk’s initiative. But Musk himself, encountering that post, commented, “That’s all it would take for real,” with a laughing-crying emoji, as if it didn’t undermine his approach.\\n\\nWatching Musk, a man recently focused on electric cars and getting humanity to Mars, direct his inventiveness toward the public-sector equivalent of TPS reports is vexing. Improving federal efficiency is a worthy project. Trump will have no incentive to deliver on it if his base credulously cheers gambits as wasteful and poorly defended as this one.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Associated Press (AP) — Barely a week after mass firings at the Food and Drug Administration, some probationary staffers received unexpected news over the weekend: The government wants them back.\\n\\nBeginning Friday night, FDA employees overseeing medical devices and other key areas received calls and emails notifying them that their recent terminations had been “rescinded effective immediately,” according to messages viewed by The Associated Press.\\n\\nREAD MORE: Federal workers sue over Elon Musk’s threat to fire them if they don’t explain their accomplishments\\n\\nThree FDA staffers impacted by the decisions spoke with the AP on condition of anonymity because they planned to continue working for the agency and weren’t authorized to discuss its internal procedures.\\n\\nThe reversal is the latest example of President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk’s chaotic approach to cost-cutting, which has resulted in several agencies firing, and then scrambling to rehire, employees responsible for nuclear weapons, national parks and other government services.\\n\\nThe FDA reinstatements followed pushback by lobbyists for the medical device industry, which pays the agency hundreds of millions of dollars annually to hire extra scientists to promptly review products. The industry’s leading trade group said Monday “a sizeable number” of device reviewers would apparently be returning to FDA.\\n\\n“This would be welcome news, and I appreciate the administration for acting quickly,” AdvaMed CEO Scott Whitaker said in an emailed statement. “We all share the same goal — an efficient, effective FDA review process that helps advance the medical technologies American patients depend on.”\\n\\nFDA staffers said entire teams of five or more medical device reviewers had been reinstated. There did not appear to be a similar effort to rehire staffers in other parts of the agency, including its food and tobacco centers.\\n\\nREAD MORE: Fired federal workers search for new jobs but struggle to replace their old ones\\n\\nThe agency hasn’t released official numbers on the terminations, but former FDA officials have pegged the number at roughly 700, with more than 220 coming from the medical device center. That would represent roughly 10 percent of the program’s total staffing.\\n\\nThe FDA did not respond to requests Monday about how many employees were being reinstated.\\n\\nLike other agencies, the FDA terminations went to employees in their probationary period, typically the first two years of federal employment. But that approach resulted in the terminations across key areas where the agency has been working to beef up staffing, including rapidly evolving fields like artificial intelligence and digital health. The cuts also included agency leaders who were recently hired for senior roles.\\n\\n“The disarray caused by the wholesale termination of a wide swath of device center staff was counterproductive and appears to have caused a variety of unintended and negative results,” said Steve Silverman, a former FDA device official who now runs a consulting firm. “It’s encouraging to see a shift in the opposite direction that recognizes the critical expertise of these staffers.”\\n\\nMany reviewers have advanced degrees in specialized medical and technological fields. They can typically earn more in the private sector than in government.\\n\\nLast week, the lobbying group AdvaMed pushed back on the firings, calling on Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to reverse course. The group warned that the cuts would result in slower approvals for companies and fewer new treatment options for patients.\\n\\n“FDA will lose hundreds of new employees, the best and most innovative hires under our most recent agreement,” Whitaker wrote in a statement posted online. He noted that the hiring of FDA device reviewers is largely financed through an ongoing five-year agreement between the FDA and medical device companies.\\n\\nMore than half the device program’s $791 million budget last year came from industry fees, according to federal figures. In return, the FDA is obligated to meet certain benchmarks for quickly and predictably reviewing applications for new and updated devices.\\n\\nFDA staffers who were reinstated said their immediate supervisors received no explanation or advance notice on the decisions. Instead, staffers received calls or emails from the FDA’s “Office of Talent Solutions,” informing them that their access to FDA computer systems and offices had been restored.\\n\\n“We are so grateful to still have you working for the FDA and serving the American public!” the emails concluded.\\n\\nA week earlier, the same employees received emails stating that they were “not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the agency’s current needs.”\\n\\nNearly half the FDA’s budget, or about $3.3 billion, comes from fees paid by drugmakers, device and tobacco companies. The result is that broad cuts to those programs won’t add much toward Musk’s stated goal of shrinking the federal budget.\\n\\nBut the financial support of industry fees did not appear to help staffers in other parts of the agency.\\n\\nThe agency’s tobacco center — which reviews new products like electronic cigarettes and nicotine pouches — is 100 percent funded by industry fees. But there did not appear to be an effort to rehire any of the estimated 100 or so employees fired from that center.\\n\\nSimilarly, the recalls did not appear to apply to the agency’s food program, which recently went though a major restructuring to better oversee essential products like infant formula and baby food.\\n\\nLast week, the FDA’s deputy commissioner for foods, Jim Jones resigned, citing “the indiscriminate firing” of nearly 90 staffers in his division, according to a copy of his resignation letter obtained by the AP. The employees fired included those with “highly technical expertise in nutrition, infant formula, food safety response” and chemical safety, Jones said.\\n\\nAP Health Writer JoNel Aleccia contributed to this story.'},\n",

Nobody has done a better job bringing to light the nuts and bolts of the DOGE campaign to destroy the federal government. On Wednesday, they published a detailed report on how the bloodletting transpired at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It seems that the cargo-shorts crowd is as ruthless as they are reputed to be, but they make up for it by being first-class dickheads.\\n\\nWorkers were informed that they had been fired with a frenetic email delivered around 9 pm ET on Tuesday night. An evidently failed mail merge meant that some affected employees were addressed as [EmployeeFirstName][EmployeeLastName], [Job Title], [Division]. “This is to provide notification that I am removing you from your position of [Job Title] and federal service consistent with the above references,” the email from acting chief human capital officer Adam Martinez says. “Unfortunately, the Agency finds that that [sic] you are not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency’s current needs.”\\n\\nThe firings follow a tumultuous few days at CFPB. On Friday, staff for Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency shut down a portion of the agency’s homepage after a day of struggling to obtain access to the CMS and other systems. WIRED reported last week that three DOGE staffers, including Gavin Kliger and Nikhil Rajpal, were given access to CFPB’s HR, procurement, and financial infrastructure. The DOGE workers were later granted access to all of the agency’s systems on Friday, Bloomberg reported this week, including bank examination and enforcement records.\\n\\nThe CFPB was born out of necessity when the Wall Street carnivores nearly destroyed the world economy and then gobbled up the remains like roadkill.

       "   'content': '(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to the Last Post of the Week from the Blog’s Favourite Living Canadian)\\n\\nThe Eye of Sauron has found your mailbox, people. From The Washington Post:\\n\\nTrump is expected to issue an executive order as soon as this week to fire the members of the Postal Service’s governing board and place the agency under the control of the Commerce Department and Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to six people familiar with the plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisals. The board is planning to fight Trump’s order, three of those people told The Washington Post. In an emergency meeting Thursday, the board retained outside counsel and gave instructions to sue the White House if the president were to remove members of the board or attempt to alter the agency’s independent status.\\n\\nFor 250 years, the post office has been one of the best ideas Ben Franklin ever had. But not even Ol’ Bifocals could see far enough into the future to see that there would people who could find political advantage in inconveniencing massive slices of the population. Yet here we are, halfway down the slope to full privatization and, if our experience with that is any indication, opening the door to looting and profiteering and really bad service. Rural folks will get confirmation yet again that they are living in the FO part of FAFO. E-commerce will be in chaos. And, oh, yes, this is completely fcking illegal.\\n\\nTrump’s order to place the Commerce Department in charge of the Postal Service would probably violate federal law, according to postal experts. Another executive order earlier this week instructed independent agencies to align more closely with the White House, though that order is likely to prompt court challenges and the Postal Service by law is generally exempt from executive orders.\\n\\nAnd yes, Louis DeJoy, the Keith Richards of the federal bureaucracy, is still running things for now.\\n\\nThe biggest political news of the week, at least according to the shebeen’s lights, are the facts that a) the president’s poll numbers are headed down the Mariana Trench, b) President Musk’s numbers are going to beat his to the bottom, and c) their policies are all infinitely less popular than the both of them are. Out in the country, citizens are going to town-hall meetings expressly to beat up their Republican Congress-critters for enabling the bureaucratic bloodbath. All of this is breathing some welcome fresh air into the general political atmosphere.\\n\\nThat the Democratic party elites seem to be lagging behind this sudden burst of energy is no real surprise. Cultivated timidity is a tough monkey to shake. I give Bernie Sanders credit. He’s going out on the road to do town halls in places like Omaha and Iowa City the way he did when his 2016 campaign first got rolling. And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been a regular Mother Jones on the stump. We are rapidly reaching the “lead, follow, or get out of the way” moment. Not to mention that, if his numbers continue to tank, the president may misplace the rest of his marbles, and who knows what may ensue then?\\n\\nWeekly WWOZ Pick to Click: “Money Blues” (Bessie Smith): Yeah, I still pretty much love New Orleans.\\n\\nWeekly Visit to the Pathé Archives: Here, from 1949, is a delivery of some $5 billion in Marshall Plan aid to western Europe, from back in the days when we believed in such things, as well as in having allies. Personally, I like the fact that the French guy drove his new American tractor home and that he didn’t hit the guy on the horse who clearly ran an Arret sign. History is so cool—and it’s also a good prod to the national conscience.\\n\\nThe 4 Nations hockey tournament was an aesthetic and financial success. However, Boston’s Charlie McAvoy may be out for a month or more with a shoulder injury, Sidney Crosby has a bum elbow that clearly affected his shooting, and reporter Emily Kaplan said that she was aware of several players who may not be in shape to play when the NHL season resumes. After the glow wears off, I suspect that several coaches and owners will be sharing second thoughts. Here’s El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago ruining what was a fine evening of puckball.\\n\\nI’ll be calling our GREAT American Hockey Team this morning to spur them on towards victory tonight against Canada, which with FAR LOWER TAXES AND MUCH STRONGER SECURITY, will someday, maybe soon, become our cherished, and very important, Fifty First State. I will be speaking before the Governors tonight in D.C., and will sadly, therefore, be unable to attend. But we will all be watching, and if Governor Trudeau would like to join us, he would be most welcome. Good luck to everybody, and have a GREAT game tonight. So exciting! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP\\n\\nCanadian PM Justin Trudeau was on his game with this response:\\n\\nYou can’t take our country—and you can’t take our game.\\n\\nGlorious and free.\\n\\n(By the way, both Wayne Gretzky and Tiger Woods have some ’splainin’ to do for hobnobbing with this president.)\\n\\nDiscovery Corner: Hey, look what we found! From Archaeology News online:\\n\\nIn October 2022, the team first found the tomb’s entrance and main corridor in Wadi Gabbanat el-Qurud, about 2.4 kilometers west of the Valley of the Kings. At first, archaeologists thought it might be a queen’s tomb because it was close to the burial places of Thutmose III’s wives and Queen Hatshepsut. But as they kept digging and studying the inscriptions on alabaster vessels in the tomb, they confirmed its true owner.\\n\\nDr. Mohamed Ismail Khaled, Secretary-General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said the inscriptions named Thutmose II as the “deceased king” and mentioned his wife, Hatshepsut. “This discovery is one of the most significant archaeological finds in recent years,” Dr. Khaled remarked. He pointed out that, before now, no funeral furniture linked to Thutmose II had been found in any museum worldwide, which makes this discovery especially valuable to Egyptologists.\\n\\nThutmose apparently was a utility pharaoh, although his wife was the sharp one and ascended to the throne when Thutmose kicked. She is famous to people of a certain age by being the person who bestowed the powers of Isis upon science teacher Andrea Thomas.\\n\\nHey, ScienceAlert, is it a good day for dinosaur news? It’s always a good day for dinosaur news!\\n\\nBetween 122 and 108 million years ago, the Australian landmass was much farther south than today. Victoria was positioned within the Antarctic Circle, separated from Tasmania by a vast rift valley rather than open sea.\\n\\nAnd how do we know this? Because ... dinos. That’s why.\\n\\nResearch over the past decade has revealed striking similarities between Australian and South American dinosaurs. These include megaraptorids with claws shaped like scythes, and small, fleet-footed elasmarian ornithopods. There were also armoured parankylosaurians and colossal sauropods. Our newly described fossils show that a bunch of different carnivorous dinosaurs seen in South America also thrived in the Cretaceous of southeastern Australia. Two shinbones provide the first evidence of carcharodontosaurs (“shark-toothed lizards”) in Australia. A third shinbone provides strong evidence for the presence of unenlagiines, a southern group of dromaeosaurs (“running lizards”). A fourth shinbone and two tail vertebrae with their chevrons, which are from a megaraptorid, represent one of Australia’s largest-known carnivorous dinosaurs.\\n\\nAnd, as we know, the shinbone is connected to the leg bone, and they all lived then to make us happy now.\\n\\nI’ll be back on Monday, for whatever fresh hell awaits.. Be well and play nice, ya bastids. Stay above the snake-line and wear the damn masks, and take the damn shots, especially the boosters and the New One. In your spare time, spare a thought for everyone touched by the floods in Kentucky and by the crash in Washington, and in the fire zones in Los Angeles, and for all the folks in Ukraine, who stubbornly fight on, and all the folks in Gaza, with winter coming on, and all the people in New Orleans, Las Vegas, Nashville, and Queens, who were visited by the Crazy before the year had hardly begun. And the folks in L.A., now fighting floods and mudslides exacerbated by the recent wildfires. And the folks in Lahaina, who are still rebuilding. And all the folks we regularly cited here in the year gone by, and especially for our fellow citizens in the LGBTQ+ community, who deserve so much better from their country than they’ve been getting. And for all of us, who will be getting exactly what we deserve.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-12T18:59:00',\n",
       "   'content': 'It was a red-letter day for trading favors around the Oval Office on Tuesday, a red letter delivered, of course, in a plain brown envelope. First, out of pure spite and corporate avarice, the president effectively shuttered the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, guaranteeing that credit-card hustlers and loan-company sharpers can run amok among the populace again. From The Washington Post:\\n\\nThe system is called X Money, and in the vision sketched out by executives, it would allow millions of users on X to instantly send money to friends, family members, and others. Heralding it as a breakthrough in finance, the company said in late January it would launch this year with the support of Visa, which processes billions of transactions globally. Because of its direct ties to bank accounts and debit cards, X Money normally would fall under the remit of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency with vast powers to crack down on unfair, deceptive and predatory corporate practices. Formed in the wake of the 2008 financial collapse, the CFPB has policed traditional banks and lenders as well as Apple, Google, and other tech giants that seek to offer digital versions of those services.\\n\\nThe CFPB, a highly effective federal agency and, therefore, a thing to be destroyed by the cargo-shorts cargo cult currently on a rampage throughout the executive branch. It is also the brainchild of Senator Professor Warren, against whom the president has that deep and profound grudge that he holds against anyone who is demonstrably smarter than he is. So with the blood of USAID still fresh on their hands, the DOGE bros have arrived at the CFPB’s door. From The Hill:\\n\\nHowever, as Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) sweeps into one agency after another with the directive to slash wide swaths of government funding, the new assault on the CFPB has sparked concerns from consumer advocacy groups and Democratic lawmakers about just how far the administration will go this time.\\n\\n“I think everyone assumes this is the USAID playbook, and I think everyone’s operating off of the assumption that we’re about to get annihilated, the way that they were annihilated,” a CFPB employee told The Hill, referring to the U.S. Agency for International Development. The moves at the CFPB have drawn parallels with USAID, where staff were also told to stay out of headquarters and cease work before the Trump administration attempted to place thousands of employees on administrative leave. The effort was put on hold by a federal judge Friday night.\\n\\nAlso, in one of the most preposterous press opportunities since LBJ’s beagles departed the premises, the president and Porcelain Boy announced a plan to freeze all investigations of foreign corruption on the part of American corporations, essentially shredding the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977. This is, of course, insane. From The New York Times:\\n\\nTrump administration officials have also ordered the shutdown of an initiative to seize assets owned by foreign kleptocrats, dialed back scrutiny of foreign influence efforts aimed at the United States and replaced the top career Justice Department official handling corruption cases. The moves by Mr. Trump and his Justice Department were somewhat in line with a critique by conservative lawyers of prosecutors. They argue prosecutors have long overused anti-corruption law to try to punish political behavior that, while unethical, unpopular, or unwise, is not criminal.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut to some current and former Justice Department officials, the steps reflect the degree to which Mr. Trump—as a politician who has faced multiple indictments, and a real estate magnate who prioritizes deal-making—is deeply antagonistic to law enforcement efforts to clean up politics and corporations.\\n\\nNothing gets by those former DOJ employees, boy.\\n\\nThe whole carnival midway act in the Oval Office was unprecedentedly, transcendentally weird. Musk brought along one of his children—a son named X Æ A-Xii, but everyone calls him ii—as a prop. (The kid earned his place in the sun by picking his nose, clearly revolting the Germophobe in Chief.) Meanwhile, Pops rambled on as though his speech center were run by monkeys. But the clowns only work the sideshows. The center ring is pay-to-play.'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-24T19:07:05',\n",
       "   'content': 'Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\\n\\nElon Musk’s siege of the federal government entered a new phase late Saturday afternoon, when he announced on X that federal workers would soon be receiving an email “requesting to understand what they got done last week,” adding, quite ominously, “Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.”\\n\\nA few hours later, millions of federal workers received the promised email sent from the Office of Personnel Management account hr@opm.gov, the same one Musk used to send his “Fork in the Road” email back on Jan. 28.\\n\\nThe message asked workers to reply with “5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager,” giving them until Monday night to complete the task. The email further urged workers not to send classified information in their replies. Musk’s threat from earlier was conspicuously absent.\\n\\nThe email was eerily similar to one Musk sent out shortly after buying Twitter, demanding that its software engineers email him a bullet-point summary of their code modifications and “10 screenshots of the most salient lines of code,” a directive that IT professionals at the time criticized as a uniquely bad way to assess code. The same could be said of Musk’s latest email, which presses multitudes of federal employees across many fields of expertise to justify their jobs to a mysterious axe-wielding entity that couldn’t possibly understand the work they all do.\\n\\nUnderstandably, the email sparked immediate panic among federal workers over the next move that might come from Musk, who only days earlier had shown up onstage at the Conservative Political Action Conference wearing sunglasses, slurring his words, and wielding a “chain saw for bureaucracy.” Musk, who is not funny, also used the appearance to complain about “the left’s sense of humor.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIt’s unclear why Musk’s “Nonresponse equals resignation” threat doesn’t also appear in the email, but one might plausibly speculate that an attorney intervened, given the Merit Systems Protection Board’s unequivocal finding that a federal worker’s resignation must be “affirmative” and “voluntary,” as a matter of “fundamental fairness and due process.” Of course, the email also declined to even acknowledge Musk’s widely published threat, guaranteeing no small amount of fear, loathing, and confusion among the recipients, a list that evidently includes federal judges and their clerks, and even the FBI, prompting Director Kash Patel to issue a message to his staff to “pause” any response “for now.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDespite the email’s instruction to withhold classified information, encouraging federal workers to describe their jobs in emails sent to Musk’s untested private email server seems at best unwise, from a security and privacy standpoint. In a Privacy Impact Assessment dated Feb. 5, a week after Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency team plugged in an untested email server, authors Riccardo Biasini and Greg Hogan, both of DOGE, essentially argued that there was no need to conduct a PIA for its “Government-Wide Email System.” The reason DOGE’s email server should be considered exempt is because the system would be used only for “(1) the names of federal employees, (2) their government email addresses, and (3) short, voluntary email responses” (emphasis mine). Biasini’s and Hogan’s retroactive justification for the use of the server accords with the way it was applied in the sending of the “Fork in the Road” email, and the responses it anticipated. But Saturday night’s email from OPM is “voluntary” only if you ignore Musk’s threat from earlier that day, and the responses it invites are open-ended. In other words, after retroactively manufacturing a basis for the legality of the email server, DOGE and Musk crossed over the line they themselves drew.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFederal agencies are already required, per 5 USC Section 4302, to establish appraisal systems to rate employees’ performance. The agencies are constrained to use “objective” standards and criteria appropriate to the particular employee being evaluated. The email from hr@opm.gov exists entirely outside this framework, starting with the fact that the OPM isn’t an agency. As Kevin Owen, a partner at Gilbert Employment Law, explained to me, “OPM has a limited mandate and oversight capacity—by design, it can’t issue instructions to workers of the various agencies. Unless you work for OPM, you don’t report to OPM.” Owen characterized the email as the “least efficient thing they’ve done so far,” suggesting that Musk may have created litigation opportunities for plaintiffs’ attorneys if workers can bill the time they spent responding to the email as overtime.\\n\\nRelated From Slate Trump Issued Perhaps His Most Terrifying Executive Order on Tuesday Read More\\n\\nYet, it seems certain that many federal employees will respond by the Monday night deadline. The National Institutes of Health sent an email informing its workers to “read and respond per the instructions.” A similar order was sent out by Department of Agriculture management, according to a worker there. But the State Department and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration joined the FBI in telling its workers to pump the brakes. Space News reported that NASA struggled to come up with a unified response, ultimately advising workers to refrain from replying. The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents the Department of Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug Administration, strongly advised its members not to respond, noting the lack of coordination with the FDA and expressing concern about workers’ rights and interests.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMusk himself appears to be conceding that the OPM email and his threat were a pretext, suggesting in a post Sunday morning that his purpose is to test bodies for a pulse. “The reason this matters is that a significant number of people who are supposed to be working for the government are doing so little work that they are not checking their email at all!” He further claimed, without evidence, that “non-existent people” or the “identities of dead people” are being used to collect paychecks. Dead voters have long been a fixation for the right, no matter how often these claims are debunked, so it seems natural that these imaginary zombie voters would one day take government jobs.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nA minor irony to Musk’s dead-workers-collecting-paychecks claim is that Musk himself is apparently a legal ghost, heading, but not really heading, DOGE, a quasi-legal entity that is presently enjoying all the authority of a congressionally created federal agency without any of the reporting and transparency obligations. Compelling civil servants to answer to an unanswerable fourth branch of government, as Rep. Jamie Raskin puts it, seems not only unprecedented but uniquely un-American.\\n\\nFor Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget and the architect of Project 2025, the primary motivating factor behind his proposal to make it easier to fire federal workers is clearly malice, per his statement previewing his actions last year: “We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected.” For Musk, a relative newcomer to far-right politics, it seems to be more about domination and the lulz, as the kids used to say.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMore than one worker has used the term mind games to describe to me Musk’s treatment of them. In playing these mind games, Musk is ignoring the rules of the game that the rest of the country has at least tried to follow for more than two centuries. Armed with the president’s acquiescence and blessing, not to mention Congress’ complicit silence, Musk is playing the federal government in God mode. He unlawfully repurposed and modified—colloquially, hacked—OPM using this unprecedented access to treat government workers as nonplayer characters, answerable to him above their agencies. Unfortunately for the remaining federal workers, who never signed up to take part in an eccentric billionaire’s nihilistic simulation, these days are painfully real.'}],\n",

       "   'content': 'Killing Me Softly singer Roberta Flack dies aged 88\\n\\n2 hours ago Mark Savage Music Correspondent\\n\\nGetty Images Roberta Flack scored several number one hits in the 1970s\\n\\nThe R&B singer Roberta Flack, best known for the hits The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face and Killing Me Softly With His Song, has died at the age of 88. \"We are heartbroken that the glorious Roberta Flack passed away this morning, February 24, 2025,\" said a statement from her representatives. \"She died peacefully surrounded by her family. Roberta broke boundaries and records. She was also a proud educator.\" Flack had previously announced in 2022 that she had motor neurone disease, and could no longer sing.\\n\\nBorn in North Carolina and raised in Arlington, Virginia, the musician started out as a classical pianist. She gained a full school scholarship to Howard University aged just 15. Her classical training led her into teaching, but at night she\\'d accompany opera singers on piano, singing pop standards during the breaks. \"The whole while I was studying classical music, especially in my younger years, I was also doing a lot of doo-ron-ron, shoo-doo-bee-doo, all of that stuff, with my peers, so I\\'ve been fortunate enough to be surrounded by music all of my life, the Bach and the Chopin and the Schumann on one hand, and all the rhythm and blues,\" she explained. Her recording career started after she was discovered singing in a jazz club by musician Les McCann, who later wrote that \"her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I\\'ve ever known\". But she didn\\'t score her first hit until she was in her 30s - when her recording of Ewan MacColl\\'s The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face was used to soundtrack an explicit love scene in Clint Eastwood\\'s 1971 film Play Misty For Me. It was subsequently named song of the year at the Grammys. Flack won the award a second time the following year, for Killing Me Softly With His Song. After topping the charts again in 1974 with Feel Like Makin\\' Love, Flack took a break from performing to concentrate on recording and charitable causes. She spent much of the 1980s touring and over the course of her career, worked with artists including Donny Hathaway and Miles Davis. In 1991 she returned to the charts with a duet with Maxi Priest called Set the Night to Music (from the album of the same name). She also recorded an album of Beatles covers, called Let It Be Roberta, in 2012.\\n\\n\\'True soul\\'\\n\\nAccording to the Guardian, Flack once told a journalist: \"What I consider myself is a soulful singer, in that I try to sing with all the feeling that I have in my body and my mind. \"A person with true soul is one who can take anybody\\'s song and transcend all the flaws, the technique and just make you listen.\"\\n\\nGetty Images Roberta Flack and The Fugees, pictured together in 2009\\n\\nOnce married, to US jazz musician Stephen Novosel, the star devoted a lot of her time to the Roberta Flack School of Music in New York. Reverend Jesse Jackson once described her as \"socially relevant and politically unafraid\". In 2020, a year after having a stroke, Flack was awarded a lifetime achievement award from the Grammys. \"It\\'s a tremendous and overwhelming honour,\" she said at the time. \"I\\'ve tried my entire career to tell stories through my music. This award is a validation to me that my peers heard my thoughts and took in what I have tried to give.\"'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Roberta Flack, the Grammy-winning singer and pianist whose intimate vocal and musical style on \"Killing Me Softly with His Song,\" \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\" and other hits made her one of the top recording artists of the 1970s and an influential performer long after, died Monday, her publicist confirmed to CBS News. She was 88.\\n\\nShe died at home surrounded by her family, publicist Elaine Schock said in a statement. Flack announced in 2022 she had ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig\\'s disease, and could no longer sing.\\n\\nLittle known before her early 30s, Flack became an overnight star after Clint Eastwood used \"The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face\" as the soundtrack for one of cinema\\'s more memorable and explicit love scenes, between the actor and Donna Mills in his 1971 film \"Play Misty for Me.\" The hushed, hymn-like ballad, with Flack\\'s graceful soprano afloat on a bed of soft strings and piano, topped the Billboard pop chart in 1972 and received a Grammy for record of the year.\\n\\n\"The record label wanted to have it re-recorded with a faster tempo, but he said he wanted it exactly as it was,\" Flack told The Associated Press in 2018. \"With the song as a theme song for his movie, it gained a lot of popularity and then took off.\"\\n\\nRoberta Flack performs at Lincoln Center, in New York City, on Aug. 13, 2008. Jack Vartoogian / Getty Images\\n\\nIn 1973, she matched both achievements with \"Killing Me Softly With His Song,\" becoming the first artist to win consecutive Grammys for best record.\\n\\nShe was a classically trained pianist discovered in the late 1960s by jazz musician Les McCann, who later wrote that \"her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I\\'ve ever known.\" Versatile enough to summon the up-tempo gospel passion of Aretha Franklin, Flack often favored a more reflective and measured approach.\\n\\nFor Flack\\'s many admirers, she was a sophisticated and bold new presence in the music world and in the social and civil rights movements of the time, her friends including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Angela Davis, whom Flack visited in prison while Davis faced charges — for which she was acquitted — for murder and kidnapping. Flack sang at the funeral of Jackie Robinson, Major League Baseball\\'s first Black player, and was among the many guest performers on the feminist children\\'s entertainment project created by Marlo Thomas, \"Free to Be ... You and Me.\"\\n\\nRoberta Cleopatra Flack, the daughter of musicians, was born in Black Mountain, North Carolina, and raised in Arlington, Virginia. A gospel fan as a child, she was so talented a piano player that at age 15 she received a full scholarship to Howard, the historically Black university.\\n\\nFlack\\'s other hits from the 1970s included the cozy \"Feel Like Makin\\' Love\" and two duets with her close friend and former Howard University classmate Donny Hathaway, \"Where Is the Love\" and \"The Closer I Get to You\" — a partnership that ended in tragedy. In 1979, she and Hathaway were working on an album of duets when he suffered a breakdown during recording and later that night fell to his death from his hotel room in Manhattan.\\n\\n\"We were deeply connected creatively,\" Flack told Vibe in 2022, upon the 50th anniversary of the million-selling \"Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway\" album. \"He could play anything, sing anything. Our musical synergy was unlike (anything) I\\'d had before or since.\"\\n\\nRoberta Flack is seen in a photograph taken in June 1971. Jack Mitchell/Getty Images\\n\\nShe never matched her first run of success, although she did have a hit in the 1980s with the Peabo Bryson duet \"Tonight, I Celebrate My Love\" and in the 1990s with the Maxi Priest duet \"Set the Night to Music.\" In the mid-90s, Flack received new attention after the Fugees recorded a Grammy-winning cover of \"Killing Me Softly,\" which she eventually performed on stage with the hip-hop group.\\n\\nOverall, she won five Grammys (three for \"Killing Me Softly\"), was nominated eight other times and was given a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2020, with John Legend and Ariana Grande among those praising her.\\n\\n\"I love that connection to other artists because we understand music, we live music, it\\'s our language,\" Flack told songwriteruniverse.com in 2020. \"Through music we understand what we are thinking and feeling.

       "   'content': 'Roberta Flack, the US singer behind a string of hits including Killing Me Softly With His Song, has died aged 88. “We are heartbroken that the glorious Roberta Flack passed away this morning, February 24, 2025,” a statement from her spokesperson read. “She died peacefully surrounded by her family. Roberta broke boundaries and records. She was also a proud educator.”\\n\\nWith her graceful presence, genre-crossing versatility and ability to give voice to the full range of love’s highs and lows, Flack is widely considered one of soul and R&B’s greatest ever artists.\\n\\nFlack was born in 1937 in Black Mountain, North Carolina, to musical parents. Her mother Irene was a church choir organist, meaning Flack was introduced to religious and classical music early on. She began playing the piano aged nine and by 15 she was admitted to Howard University to study music on a full scholarship, one of the youngest students to be accepted in the school’s history.\\n\\nAt 19, the new Howard graduate aspired to be an opera singer, before taking up a teaching post in North Carolina. Alongside this work, Flack started performing in nightclubs during evenings and weekends, weaving elements of classical, blues, folk, Motown and pop. Her virtuosity landed her regular spots at venues across Washington DC and in 1968, a residency at Mr Henry’s Restaurant led Flack to give up teaching for good.\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Roberta Flack with Donny Hathaway. Photograph: GAB Archive/Redferns\\n\\nShe became acquainted with soul jazz pianist and singer Les McCann, who in turn introduced her to Atlantic Records – by early 1969 she was recording her debut album First Take, reportedly in a window of 10 hours. The album documented those years at Henry’s, immortalising the cross-genre collection of tracks she had spent so long practising there. In the liner notes of the original edition, McCann wrote: “Her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I’ve ever known. I laughed, cried, and screamed for more.”\\n\\nIt took until 1971, however, and a placement on the soundtrack to Clint Eastwood’s Play Misty for Me, before her cover of Ewan MacColl’s folk ballad The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face became her first major US hit. It spent six weeks at No 1 in 1972, earning a Grammy award for record of the year in 1973. Killing Me Softly With His Song earned her the same award in 1974, making Flack the first artist to win in two consecutive years (a feat since repeated by U2 and Billie Eilish). That year she scored another US No 1 with Feel Like Makin’ Love.\\n\\nAround this time, the star began collaborating with the soul legend Donny Hathaway; the pair went on to have two US Top 5 hits with Where Is the Love and The Closer I Get to You. In 1980, a year after Hathaway’s death, the pair had a posthumous hit in the UK with Back Together Again, which reached No 3, though she had her biggest UK hit with new duet partner Peabo Bryson: the ballad Tonight, I Celebrate My Love reached No 2 in 1983. Bryson has paid tribute to Flack, calling her an “iconic and divinely gifted artist and friend … She was my greatest inspiration”.\\n\\nFlack’s impressive range of influences and collaborators was testament to her multidisciplinary approach and idiosyncratic style. She duetted with Michael Jackson, toured with Miles Davis and covered Leonard Cohen and Laura Nyro. After her initial success, she became associated with the growth of quiet storm, a deep, mature and ruminative offshoot of R&B which later inspired the likes of Erykah Badu, D’Angelo and the Fugees (whose own take on Killing Me Softly would rival Flack’s to be the definitive version). More recently, in 2012, Flack released a string of Beatles covers in an album titled Let It Be Roberta.\\n\\nShe once told a journalist: “What I consider myself is a soulful singer, in that I try to sing with all the feeling that I have in my body and my mind. A person with true soul is one who can take anybody’s song and transcend all the flaws, the technique and just make you listen.”\\n\\nAfter becoming unwell on stage in 2018, her manager revealed that Flack had suffered a stroke some years earlier.\\n\\nIn 1966, Flack married jazz musician Steve Novosel. The couple divorced in 1972, and a later marriage also ended in divorce.\\n\\nAmong others paying tribute to Flack was Oscar-winning singer and actor Jennifer Hudson, who said she was “one of the great soul singers of all time. Rest well, Ms Flack. Your legacy lives on”.'},\n",

Flack announced in 2022 she had ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig\\'s disease, and could no longer sing,\\n\\nLittle known before her early 30s, Flack became an overnight star after Clint Eastwood used \"The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face\" as the soundtrack for one of cinema\\'s more memorable and explicit love scenes, between the actor and Donna Mills in his 1971 film \"Play Misty for Me.\" The hushed, hymn-like ballad, with Flack\\'s graceful soprano afloat on a bed of soft strings and piano, topped the Billboard pop chart in 1972 and received a Grammy for record of the year.\\n\\n\"The record label wanted to have it re-recorded with a faster tempo, but he said he wanted it exactly as it was,\" Flack told The Associated Press in 2018. \"With the song as a theme song for his movie, it gained a lot of popularity and then took off.\"\\n\\nIn 1973, she matched both achievements with \"Killing Me Softly With His Song,\" becoming the first artist to win consecutive Grammys for best record.\\n\\nShe was a classically trained pianist discovered in the late 1960s by jazz musician Les McCann, who later wrote that \"her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I\\'ve ever known.\" Versatile enough to summon the up-tempo gospel passion of Aretha Franklin, Flack often favored a more reflective and measured approach\\n\\nFor Flack\\'s many admirers, she was a sophisticated and bold new presence in the music world and in the social and civil rights movements of the time, her friends including the Rev.

       "   'content': 'CNN —\\n\\nRoberta Flack, the Grammy-winning soul singer best known for her celebrated interpretations of romantic ballads like “Killing Me Softly With His Song,” as well as her professional collaborations and social activism, has died, according to a statement from her publicist.\\n\\nShe was 88.\\n\\nFlack died Monday at her home, surrounded by her family, Elaine Schock, her publicist, told CNN. Her death followed several years of health challenges, including a diagnosis, revealed publicly in late 2022, of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. The progressive condition, often referred to as Lou Gehrig’s disease, made it impossible for Flack to sing, her representatives said at the time.\\n\\nFlack, however, had already long-cemented her legacy as one of the defining voices of her generation – both as an interpreter of others’ songs and a writer of her own – notching a slew of chart-topping hits and racking up accolades: Over her career, the classically trained daughter of a church organist secured 14 Grammy nominations and won five, including a lifetime achievement award in 2020 and back-to-back Record of the Year wins.\\n\\nQuestlove, drummer for The Roots, musical director for “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” and a filmmaker, paid tribute to Flack.\\n\\n“Thank You Roberta Flack,” he captioned a throwback photo of the late artist. “Rest In Melody.”\\n\\nBorn in Black Mountain, North Carolina, and raised in Arlington, Virginia, Flack received classical music training throughout her childhood, starting piano lessons at age 9. By 15, she’d earned a scholarship to Howard University, where she graduated in 1958 with a bachelor’s degree in music education.\\n\\nFlack taught music for a time and wanted to pursue classical music – but found the genre in the 1960s disinclined to welcome her.\\n\\n“One of the hassles of being a Black female musician is that people are always backing you into a corner and telling you to sing soul,” she once told TIME. “I’m a serious artist. I feel a kinship with people like Arthur Rubinstein and Glenn Gould. If I can’t play (20th-century orchestral composer Bela) Bartok when I want to play Bartok, then nothing else matters.”\\n\\nA voice teacher encouraged Flack to pursue pop music instead, and she spent nights and weekends performing in clubs in Washington, DC, before her big break one night at Mr. Henry’s, where she was discovered by jazz musician Les McCann. He helped land her an audition with Atlantic Records for which, the story goes, she played more than 40 songs over three hours.“I was so anxious and so happy, and I still am,” she told Philadelphia Weekly decades later, “but it was all a brand-new experience, and I probably sang too many songs.”\\n\\nHer debut record, “First Take,” followed soon after, in 1969. It included her version of “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,” which was written by folk singer Ewan MacColl and helped catapult Flack to superstardom after Clint Eastwood used the recording for his 1971 film, “Play Misty for Me.” The following year, it shot to the top of the Billboard Hot 100, where it spent six weeks at No. 1, and won Record of the Year at the 1973 Grammy Awards.\\n\\nBy that time, Flack was already well-established, having released her sophomore follow-up, “Chapter Two,” as well as the album “Quiet Fire” and a record with Donny Hathaway, who became a close collaborator before his death in 1979. Together they won another 1973 Grammy for their duet, “Where Is the Love.”\\n\\nRoberta Flack performing in 1981. Paul Natkin/Archive Photos/Getty Images\\n\\n1973 also saw Flack release her record, “Killing Me Softly,” with the titular track, “Killing Me Softly with His Song” – another smash hit that spent five weeks at the top of the Billboard chart. It would net her another two Grammy awards in 1974, for Record of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance by a female artist.\\n\\nAcross her career, Flack also interpreted a wide variety of artists, including Leonard Cohen and The Beatles, and by her fifth solo album, “Feel Like Makin’ Love,” she’d taken over as producer – a role typically filled by men in a male-dominated industry – crediting herself as Rubina Flake, her self-styled alter ego.\\n\\nWhile her most recognizable songs might have been love songs, Flack never avoided complex issues: She tackled racial injustice on tracks like “Tryin’ Times,” social and economic inequality on “Compared to What” and nodded to the challenges faced by the LGBTQ community in her version of “Ballad of the Sad Young Men.” The Rev. Jesse Jackson once referred to Flack as “socially relevant and politically unafraid,” according to her website, though as an older adult, she lamented that many of the problems she’d confronted as a musician still festered.\\n\\n“I’m deeply saddened that many of the songs I recorded 50 years ago about civil rights, equal rights, poverty, hunger and suffering in our society are still relevant in 2020,” she told AARP in 2020, acknowledging connections in her music to “the growing economic disparities, to Black Lives Matter, to police brutality, to activism versus apathy, and the need for each of us to see it and address it.”\\n\\nRoberta Flack in 2018. Matt Licari/Invision/AP\\n\\nThat legacy has persisted through the decades, as Flack influenced younger artists like Lauryn Hill and the Fugees – who released their own celebrated version of “Killing Me Softly” in 1996 – along with Lizzo, Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande.\\n\\nWhether in protest, romance or the classics, whatever theme Flack approached, “every single song I’ve recorded expressed something deep and personal to me,” she told NPR music journalist Ann Powers in 2020. “Each was my singular focus whether in the studio or on the stage.”'},\n",

Flack announced in 2022 she had ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, and could no longer sing,\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nLittle known before her early 30s, Flack became an overnight star after Clint Eastwood used “The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face” as the soundtrack for one of cinema’s more memorable and explicit love scenes, between the actor and Donna Mills in his 1971 film “Play Misty for Me.” The hushed, hymn-like ballad, with Flack’s graceful soprano afloat on a bed of soft strings and piano, topped the Billboard pop chart in 1972 and received a Grammy for record of the year. In 1973, she matched both achievements with “Killing Me Softly,” becoming the first artist to win consecutive Grammys for best record.\\n\\nShe was a classically trained pianist discovered in the late 1960s by jazz musician Les McCann, who later wrote that “her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I’ve ever known.” Versatile enough to summon the up-tempo gospel passion of Aretha Franklin, Flack often favored a more reflective and measured approach.\\n\\nFor Flack’s many admirers, she was a sophisticated and bold new presence in the music world and in the social and civil rights movements of the time, her friends including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Angela Davis, whom Flack visited in prison while Davis faced charges — for which she was acquitted — for murder and kidnapping. Flack sang at the funeral of Jackie Robinson, major league baseball’s first Black player, and was among the many guest performers on the feminist children’s entertainment project created by Marlo Thomas, “Free to Be ... You and Me.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nRoberta Cleopatra Flack, the daughter of musicians, was born in Black Mountain, North Carolina, and raised in Arlington, Virginia. A gospel fan as a child, she was so talented a piano player that at age 15 she received a full scholarship to Howard, the historically Black university.\\n\\nFlack’s other hits from the 1970s included the cozy “Feel Like Makin’ Love” and two duets with her close friend and former Howard University classmate Donny Hathaway, “Where Is the Love” and ”The Closer I Get to You” — a partnership that ended in tragedy. In 1979, she and Hathaway were working on an album of duets when he suffered a breakdown during recording and later that night fell to his death from his hotel room in Manhattan.\\n\\n“We were deeply connected creatively,” Flack told Vibe in 2022, upon the 50th anniversary of the million-selling “Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway” album. “He could play anything, sing anything. Our musical synergy was unlike (anything) I’d had before or since.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nShe never matched her first run of success, although she did have a hit in the 1980s with the Peabo Bryson duet “Tonight, I Celebrate My Love” and in the 1990s with the Maxi Priest duet “Set the Night to Music.” In the mid-90s, Flack received new attention after the Fugees recorded a Grammy-winning cover of “Killing Me Softly,” which she eventually performed on stage with the hip-hop group.\\n\\nOverall, she won five Grammys (three for “Killing Me Softly”), was nominated eight other times and was given a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2020, with John Legend and Ariana Grande among those praising her.\\n\\n“I love that connection to other artists because we understand music, we live music, it’s our language,” Flack told songwriteruniverse.com in 2020. “Through music we understand what we are thinking and feeling. No matter what challenge life presents, I am at home with my piano, on a stage, with my band, in the studio, listening to music. I can find my way when I hear music.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn 2022, Beyoncé placed Flack, Franklin and Diana Ross among others in a special pantheon of heroines name-checked in the Grammy-nominated “Queens Remix” of “Break My Soul.”\\n\\nFlack was briefly married to Stephen Novosel, an interracial relationship that led to tension with each of their families, and earlier had a son, the singer and keyboardist Bernard Wright. For years, she lived in Manhattan’s Dakota apartment building, on the same floor as John Lennon and Yoko Ono, who became a close friend and provided liner notes for a Flack album of Beatles covers, “Let It Be Roberta.” She also devoted extensive time to the Roberta Flack School of Music, based in New York and attended mostly by students between ages 6 to 14.\\n\\nFlack had taught music in D.C.-area junior high schools for several years in her 20s, while performing after hours in clubs. She sometimes backed other singers, but her own shows at Washington’s renowned Mr. Henry’s attracted such celebrity patrons as Burt Bacharach, Ramsey Lewis and Johnny Mathis. The club’s owner, Henry Yaffe, converted an apartment directly above into a private studio, the Roberta Flack Room.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“I wanted to be successful, a serious all-round musician,” she told The Telegraph in 2015. “I listened to a lot of Aretha, the Drifters, trying to do some of that myself, playing, teaching.”\\n\\nFlack was signed to Atlantic Records and her debut album, “First Take,” a blend of gospel, soul, flamenco and jazz, came out in 1969. One track was a love song by the English folk artist Ewan MacColl: “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,” written in 1957 for his future wife, singer Peggy Seeger. Flack not only knew of the ballad, but used it while working with a glee club during her years as an educator.\\n\\nGo Ad-Free — And Protect The Free Press The next four years will change America forever.

       "   'content': 'Grammy award-winning singer Roberta Flack, who crooned hits like “Killing Me Softly With His Song” and “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,” has died, a representative confirmed to NBC News.\\n\\nShe was 88.\\n\\nIn November 2022, a representative announced that Flack had ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, and could no longer sing.\\n\\nThe progressive disease “has made it impossible to sing and not easy to speak,” Flack’s manager Suzanne Koga said in a news release.\\n\\nIn a statement on Monday, representatives for Flack said they are \"heartbroken\" by her passing.\\n\\n\"She died peacefully surrounded by her family,\" Koga and Mikel Gilmore said in the statement. \"Roberta broke boundaries and records. She was also a proud educator.\"\\n\\nFlack was born Feb. 10, 1937, in North Carolina. The daughter of a church organist, Flack began playing classical piano at a young age.\\n\\nAt 15, her talents earned her a scholarship to Howard University in Washington, D.C.\\n\\nJazz musician Les McCann claims he discovered Flack’s talents while she was singing at Mr. Henry’s, a Washington nightclub.\\n\\n“Her voice touched, tapped, trapped and kicked every emotion I’ve ever known,” McCann said. “I laughed, cried and screamed for more.”\\n\\nEventually, McCann helped the young singer sign with Atlantic Records Group, where Flack recorded “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,” which was written by Ewan MacColl.\\n\\nThe song became a breakout for Flack after it appeared on her first album, “First Take,” in 1969. After being used in Clint Eastwood’s 1971 directorial debut “Play Misty for Me,” however, Atlantic Records released a radio version, which became a huge hit, peaking at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1972.\\n\\nIn 1973, the song won Grammys for record and song of the year.\\n\\nDozens of hits followed, including “Killing Me Softly With His Song” and “Feel like Makin’ Love” — Flack’s second and third No. 1 song on the Billboard Hot 100 — both of which Flack recorded with Howard University classmate Donny Hathaway.\\n\\nThe pair recorded several songs together until Hathaway died in 1979 from a fall from a New York hotel room that was ruled a suicide.\\n\\n“He was very sensitive, reacting to the things around him, and whatever was inside of him. He was a genius, so he wasn’t satisfied with his own performances, his own output,” Flack told The Washington Post shortly afterward. “Like many creative people, his good periods were very exuberant and his lows were extremely low.”\\n\\nThe loss hurt personally and professionally, but Flack would find a new partner, teaming up and touring with Peabo Bryson in 1980. The duo scored a hit in 1983 with “Tonight, I Celebrate My Love.” She spent the remainder of the 1980s touring and performing, and returned to the Top Ten once more in 1991 with “Set the Night to Music,” a duet with Maxi Priest. In 1997, Flack released an anthology of Christmas standards simply titled, “Christmas Album.”\\n\\nFlack\\'s music was introduced to a new generation in the \\'90s thanks to the Fugees. With Lauryn Hill on lead vocals, their version of \"Killing Me Softly With His Song\" topped the charts around the world in 1996.\\n\\nIn 1999, Flack received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Later that year, Flack toured in South Africa, performing for then-South African President Nelson Mandela.\\n\\nRoberta Flack performs in New York in 2012. Shahar Azran / WireImage file\\n\\nFlack toured well into her 70s and 80s, performing for audiences around the world.\\n\\nIn the late 2000s, Flack founded the Roberta Flack School of Music at the Hyde Leadership Charter School in the Bronx, “providing an innovative and inspiring music education program to underprivileged students free of charge.”\\n\\nIn recent years, however, Flack struggled with health issues. She had a stroke in 2016, and was hospitalized two years later when she felt dizziness at a Jazz Foundation of America event in which she was due to receive an award. But she returned to the stage to sing as recently as October 2018 at a party for that same charity.\\n\\nTo the end, Flack performed the classics that had made her a star.\\n\\n“(It’s hard to) be moved, to be moved constantly by your own songs,” Flack told The Associated Press in 2018. “You need it to be in tune with them, and I don’t mean in tune musically, but I mean in tune with the lyrics of the songs, with the words of the songs, and with the meaning. You need to be in tune with all of that, and that takes a little bit of doing.”\\n\\nMusicians took to social media to bid the legend farewell.\\n\\n\"Rest In Peace Roberta Flack,\" American singer-songwriter Carole King posted on Bluesky, along with a picture of the artist.\\n\\nActor and singer Jennifer Hudson called Flack \"one of the greatest soul singers of all time.\"\\n\\n\"Your legacy lives on!!!\" Hudson wrote on X, paired with a picture of Flack in her youth.\\n\\nLast year, Flack praised Hudson\\'s cover of her song “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\" which she had sang at opening night at The Smith Center in Las Vegas.\\n\\n\"Loving this smooth and powerful performance by Jennifer Hudson singing \\'First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\\'\" Flack wrote on X.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Roberta Flack’s pensive version of Bridge Over Troubled Water, from her 1971 album Quiet Fire, so impressed another rising star that he sent her a fan letter. “Dear Roberta,” wrote Elton John, “I have never heard anything this beautiful in years ... ”\\n\\nFlack, who has died aged 88, must have seemed both familiar and fascinatingly different to the young English songwriter. Like John, she was a classically trained pianist who had gravitated to pop. But she was North Carolina born, and had taught in high school before having her first hit at the age of 34. Her career was founded on her ability to sell a song using reticence and reserve, qualities that defined her from the early smash singles, The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face and Killing Me Softly With His Song, to her final album, a collection of Beatles covers released in 2012.\\n\\nHit-making partnerships with the singers Donny Hathaway and Peabo Bryson stayed in the same nuanced lane, with few departures into drama or melisma. Even as R&B became more experimental in the 1970s and 80s, Flack burrowed deeper into a gentle musical conservatism. Bar the occasional flash of social consciousness, she was, in both artistry and manner, quiet when quiet was unfashionable.\\n\\nHer reward was a string of chart hits, four Grammy awards and the loyalty of America’s adult-contemporary radio stations. Her success on AC radio also opened up the white-leaning, soft-pop format to other African-American artists.\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Roberta Flack and Luther Vandross backstage at Madison Square Garden in New York City in 1982. Photograph: Ebet Roberts/Redferns\\n\\nFlack sang as if romance were a subject deserving deep, measured consideration – a style that complemented her voice. Clarity and perfect pitch were her distinguishing vocal features, developed in part by spending her adolescence listening to the soprano Leontyne Price. If her love of opera did not set her apart enough from other teens in Arlington, Virginia, where she grew up, she was also a piano prodigy, winning a music scholarship to Howard University in Washington DC when she was 15.\\n\\nThough influenced by jazz, R&B and easy listening, Flack was not quite any of them – in the NME’s spot-on description, she created a middle ground between “genteel promiscuity and stronger codes of heartbreak – always with the lamps down low”.\\n\\nHer early albums were partly informed by the turbulence of the civil rights era – the 1969 track Tryin’ Times was unabashed protest soul – but by primarily sticking to apolitical timelessness, she became one of the top female singers of the 70s, in any genre.\\n\\nSome critics unfavourably compared her to more visceral contemporaries such as Aretha Franklin, which provoked the retort: “I am a black person who sings the way I do. I am not a black person who sounds anything like Aretha Franklin or like Chaka Khan. I shouldn’t have to change in order to be who I am.”\\n\\nThe comparisons were unfair, anyway: Franklin’s style had been forged in the Baptist church, whereas Flack had grown up as a restrained, hymn-singing Methodist. That was especially evident in sporadic nods to her southern church background, such as the bawdy 1970 single Reverend Lee; she could be muscular when required, but never to the point of full, bodily immersion.\\n\\nThe thoughtful approach served her well. The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face was the US’s top-selling single of 1972 and won record of the year at the 1973 Grammy awards. At the 1974 Grammys, Killing Me Softly – a five-week US No 1 – took record of the year and female pop vocal performance.\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Flack, far right, at the 17th Grammy awards in New York in 1975, with, from left, Art Garfunkel, Paul Simon, Yoko Ono and John Lennon. Photograph: Tim Boxer/Getty Images\\n\\nShe was born in Asheville, North Carolina, one of four children of Laron Flack, a tobacco picker, and Irene Council, a school cook. The family moved to Virginia when Roberta was five, by which point she was already playing the piano. Practising on an upright her father rescued from the local dump, by the age of 13 she was proficient enough to come second in a statewide contest for black students.\\n\\nShe was bright, finishing high school early and graduating from university at 19 with a degree in music education. For the next seven years she taught in the Washington school system, while developing a sideline as a pianist/singer in local bars. In 1968 she was spotted by the jazz pianist Les McCann, who was so taken by her voice – “I laughed, cried and screamed for more,” he said – that he introduced her to Atlantic Records.\\n\\nFlack’s jazzish, folkish early albums made a muted impact. Arguably, she owed her eventual success to the fact that Clint Eastwood paid her $2,000 in 1971 to use The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face in the film he was then directing, Play Misty for Me. The song, from her 1969 debut First Take, had not previously been a single, but was released when it proved one of the film’s talking points.\\n\\nIt duly spent six weeks at No 1, establishing Flack as a major artist. Her grip on the mid-70s charts was strengthened by duets with Hathaway – in particular, The Closer I Get to You and the Grammy-winning Where Is the Love, which were among the best songs either artist ever made.\\n\\nIn the early 80s, when the hits had dried up, a series of duets with Bryson, notably Tonight I Celebrate My Love, brought her back to the charts. Her last big seller was a synth-soul double act with Maxi Priest, Set the Night to Music, which reached the US Top 10 in 1991.\\n\\nIn the years that followed, Flack took the fail-safe route of many veteran vocalists, making Christmas albums and collections of pop and jazz standards. The hip-swinging 1994 covers album Roberta received a Grammy nomination, but a likable and inventive Beatles collection, Let It Be Roberta, sank – despite the endorsement of Yoko Ono, who was Flack’s across-the-hall neighbour in the Dakota apartments in New York.\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Roberta Flack on stage in Chicago, 1981. Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty Images\\n\\nShe hosted a syndicated weekly music and chat radio show between 1995 and 1998, but was more fulfilled by making music than talking about it. The Fugees’ highly successful 1996 cover of Killing Me Softly spurred Flack to release a remixed version of her 1972 hit, which duly topped the US dance chart.\\n\\nAfter suffering a stroke in 2016, she returned to recording in 2018 with the song Running, heard in the film 3100: Run and Become, a documentary about a 3,100-mile run held annually around the streets of New York. But in 2022 it was announced that Flack had been diagnosed with ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known in the UK as motor neurone disease, which had made it impossible for her to sing.\\n\\nIn 1966 Flack married the bassist Steven Novosel; this and a second marriage ended in divorce.'},\n",

What it saw in the inkblots offers a window into the human mind\\n\\n5 hours ago Chris Stokel-Walker\\n\\nEstudio Santa Rita\\n\\nRorschach tests play with the human imagination and our mind\\'s ability to impart meaning onto the world around us – but what does AI see in them?\\n\\nFor more than a century, the Rorschach inkblot test has been widely used as a window into people\\'s personality.\\n\\nEven if you haven\\'t done one yourself, you\\'ll recognise the mirrored ink smudges that form ambiguous shapes on cards. Developed by Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach in 1921, the test involves showing a number of inkblots to subjects, then asking them to say what they see. The images are deliberately inscrutable and open to interpretation.\\n\\nFor decades they were popular among psychologists as a way of understanding a person\\'s psyche from the creatures, objects or scenes they perceive in the shapes. It relies upon a phenomenon known as pareidolia, which is a tendency to find meaningful interpretations in things where there is none. It is the same reason why people see faces or animals in cloud formations or on the surface of the Moon.\\n\\nYou might see a butterfly in the image while someone else might see a skull. According to proponents of the test, both interpretations shed light on how you think.\\n\\n\"When a person interprets a Rorschach image, they unconsciously project elements of their psyche such as fears, desires, and cognitive biases,\" says Barbara Santini, a London-based psychologist, who uses the Rorschach test with her clients. \"The test works because human vision isn\\'t passive, but a meaning-making process shaped by personal experience.\"\\n\\nFinding meaning or familiar shapes in inkblots relies upon a number of cognitive processes that humans use every day, including memory, emotion and the ability to deal with ambiguity.\\n\\nBut what happens if you have no personal experience, or you offer it to a \"brain\" that works in an entirely different way? What might an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm recognise in these inkblots? And what would their answers tell us about the human mind?\\n\\nEstudio Santa Rita Rorschach inkblots take advantage of a phenomenon known as pareidolia (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita)\\n\\nBat or moth?\\n\\nRecent developments in the capabilities of AI models like OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT means it\\'s now possible to put that to the test. So-called \"multimodal models\" can accept image-based inputs and provide responses as easily as they are to interact with text-based prompts thanks to their machine vision capabilities.\\n\\nWe gave ChatGPT five of the 10 common images used in an inkblot test to see how it would interpret the images. But the AI system\\'s training data – information that helps establish its \"knowledge\", makes it trickier to do so.\\n\\nAI v the Mind This article is part of AI v the Mind, a series that aims to explore the limits of cutting-edge AI and learn a little about how our own brains work along the way. With some expert help, each article pits different AI tools against the human mind, asking probing questions designed to test the limits of intelligence. Can a machine write a better joke than a professional comedian, or unpick a moral conundrum more elegantly than a philosopher? We hope to find out.\\n\\nShowing the AI model the first inkblot card from an online database of inkblots, which is commonly interpreted by humans as a bat, butterfly or moth, highlighted just how literal AI vision algorithms can be.\\n\\n\"This image is a Rorschach inkblot, often used in psychological assessments to explore perception and interpretation,\" the chatbot replied. \"It is designed to be ambiguous so that each person might see something different depending on their experiences, emotions, and imagination.\"\\n\\nPretence spoiled, it then went on to explain what it saw in the same answer, without me having to prompt it further. \"For me, it resembles something symmetrical, possibly two animals or figures facing each other, or a single entity with wings outstretched,\" the chatbot responded. \"The beauty of these inkblots is that they invite individual interpretations!\"\\n\\nThe chatbot then asked me back what I saw in the image – a question I chose to ignore, instead pressing it to see which of the two resemblances it had suggested it thought was most fitting. \"Looking closely, I\\'d say it most resembles a single entity with wings outstretched – perhaps a bat or a moth, with its wings open symmetrically,\" the chatbot wrote. \"The central area could be interpreted as the body, and the details on the sides evoke the texture or shape of wings.\"\\n\\n\"I think that\\'s just rehearsing what it knows of the specific test,\" says Coen Dekker, a Dutch software developer who a decade ago asked a neural network, an early version of the technology underpinning AI chatbots today, to complete a Rorschach test. (Dekker\\'s experiment was significantly more simplified because of the technical constraints of the neural networks of the time.)\\n\\nIf an AI\\'s response resembles a human\\'s, it\\'s not because it sees the same thing but it\\'s because its training data mirrors our collective visual culture – Barbara Santini\\n\\n\"I believe it mainly identifies patterns, shapes, and textures within the blots, and then compares these features to a vast dataset of human responses to generate its interpretation of what it sees in the inkblots,\" says Ieva Kubiliute, a London-based psychologist.\\n\\nThe essence of humanity\\n\\n\"ChatGPT provides interesting, human-like responses, but it is likely not genuinely thinking – instead, it appears to be scanning an online dataset,\" says Chandril Ghosh, lecturer in psychology at the University of Kent, in the UK, specialising in mental health, AI and treatment. It\\'s similar to the way a musician who has never experienced heartbreak can still write a song that pulls at your heartstrings, simply by analysing how other similar songs like it are structured. Or as Santini, the psychologist puts it, \"If an AI\\'s response resembles a human\\'s, it\\'s not because it sees the same thing but it\\'s because its training data mirrors our collective visual culture.\"\\n\\nWhat we get is a facsimile of reality – and of thought. \"ChatGPT can accurately describe emotions without actually experiencing them,\" Ghosh says. That doesn\\'t make AI useless when it comes to matters of the mind, however. \"ChatGPT can understand emotions, describe them, and help others make sense of their feelings,\" he says.\\n\\nGhosh believes that ChatGPT is simply regurgitating random information from its dataset for the benefit of users – which gives the impression of \"thinking\", but never actually is. Part of the reason why we perceive it possibly as thinking is the way that the tech companies behind these AI chatbots present their products. ChatGPT and tools like it are always helpful, always conscientious, and always conversational. The anthropomorphising of these tools has helped their adoption – but it can muddy the waters around how they – and their outputs – are perceived.\\n\\nEstudio Santa Rita The images that an AI \"sees\" in an inkblot is merely a reflection of the data it has been trained upon (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita)\\n\\nOne way of uncovering that unreality is by simply pressing the refresh button, says Ghosh. Present ChatGPT with the same inkblot image to analyse, and it may well come up with a totally different interpretation in the same conversation.\\n\\nWhen we gave ChatGPT the same image twice, the AI did indeed give different responses.\\n\\n\"A human would typically stick to their previous answer because personal experiences and emotions influence their responses,\" says Ghosh. \"In contrast, ChatGPT generates responses based on its dataset.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s part of the problem when trying to infer meaning in what ChatGPT says about the inkblots it sees: the chatbot is simply regurgitating what its training data has encountered.\\n\\nThis is perhaps best demonstrated by an experiment by researchers at the MediaLab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US. They trained an AI algorithm called \"Norman\" – named after Alfred Hitchcock\\'s character Norman Bates – on images from a Reddit group that shares images of people dying in gruesome circumstances. When they showed Norman a set of Rorschach inkblots, the images it described seeing reflected the darkness it had been trained upon. While an algorithm trained on a more normal set of image data would see a group of birds on a tree branch, Norman described seeing a man being electrocuted.\\n\\nIt is a stark illustration of just how important the data used to train an AI can be. Train a model using bad data, and the resulting AI will reflect the flaws in that data.\\n\\nEstudio Santa Rita AIs are good at spotting patterns in large sets of data but they can also \"hallucinate\" – making up information that isn\\'t true (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita)\\n\\nBut what an AI chooses to regurgitate in response to ambiguous stimuli is interesting, says Dekker – in part because of what it says, rather than what it \"knows\" (AI systems know nothing innately). \"It has a general understanding of colour theory and what emotional responses these could give when analysed,\" says Dekker. \"I have a feeling it has a general understanding of the images and what people associate it with. This got me thinking: Wouldn\\'t it be cool if we had – or created – a new set of Rorschach-like images which the model does not know about at all, and let it analyse those?\"\\n\\nWhile this isn\\'t something Dekker is actively pursuing, we know that AI algorithms do have a tendency to \"hallucinate\" and invent information that isn\\'t true. But it is also possible force them to hallucinate too. In one experiment by computer scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US, they were able to 3D print a turtle with a particular colour and texture that fooled a machine vision system into thinking it was a rifle. Similarly, a few stickers on a stop sign can render it invisible to the algorithm – a potential risk for a self-driving car. (Read more about the \\'weird events\\' that make machines hallucinate.)\\n\\nAI algorithms are particularly good at spotting patterns, but those differing responses to a single ambiguous image also highlight an aspect of the human mind that AI can\\'t replicate: the emotions and unconscious meanings we attach to things we encounter in the world around us. There was no subjectivity in what the AI system was saying when presented with the inkblots, Kubiliute says. \"It cannot understand the symbolic meaning or emotional resonance that a human might associate with a particular image.\"\\n\\nAnd that in itself tells us a lot about the human mind. \"The human psyche is filled with internal conflicts, such as the tension between desires and morals or fears and ambitions,\" says Ghosh. \"In contrast, AI functions on clear logic and does not struggle with inner dilemmas essential to human thought and decision-making.\"\\n\\n--\\n\\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.'},\n",

A similar feature proved popular with the Chinese AI model DeepSeek. It can help a user understand how a model is working over a problem in order to modify or refine prompts.\\n\\nDianne Penn, product lead of research at Anthropic, says the scratchpad is even more helpful when combined with the ability to ratchet a model’s “reasoning” up and down. If, for example, the model struggles to break down a problem correctly, a user can ask it to spend more time working on it.\\n\\nFrontier AI companies are increasingly focused on getting the models to “reason” over problems as a way to increase their capabilities and broaden their usefulness. OpenAI, the company that kicked off the current AI boom with ChatGPT, was the first to offer a reasoning AI model, called o1, in September 2024. OpenAI has since introduced a more powerful version called o3, while rival Google has released a similar offering for its model Gemini, called Flash Thinking. In both cases, users have to switch between models to access the reasoning abilities—a key difference compared to Claude 3.7.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'THIS ARTICLE IS republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.\\n\\nResearchers at Microsoft have announced the creation of the first “topological qubits” in a device that stores information in an exotic state of matter, in what may be a significant breakthrough for quantum computing.\\n\\nAt the same time, the researchers also published a paper in Nature and a “road map” for further work. The design of the Majorana 1 processor is supposed to fit up to a million qubits, which may be enough to realize many significant goals of quantum computing—such as cracking cryptographic codes and designing new drugs and materials faster.\\n\\nIf Microsoft’s claims pan out, the company may have leapfrogged competitors such as IBM and Google, who currently appear to be leading the race to build a quantum computer.\\n\\nHowever, the peer-reviewed Nature paper only shows part of what the researchers have claimed, and the road map still includes many hurdles to be overcome. While the Microsoft press release shows off something that is supposed to be quantum computing hardware, we don’t have any independent confirmation of what it can do. Nevertheless, the news from Microsoft is very promising.\\n\\nBy now you probably have some questions. What’s a topological qubit? What’s a qubit at all, for that matter? And why do people want quantum computers in the first place?\\n\\nQuantum Bits Are Hard to Build\\n\\nQuantum computers were first dreamed up in the 1980s. Where an ordinary computer stores information in bits, a quantum computer stores information in quantum bits—or qubits.\\n\\nAn ordinary bit can have a value of 0 or 1, but a quantum bit (thanks to the laws of quantum mechanics, which govern very small particles) can have a combination of both. If you imagine an ordinary bit as an arrow that can point either up or down, a qubit is an arrow that can point in any direction (or what is called a “superposition” of up and down).\\n\\nThis means a quantum computer would be much faster than an ordinary computer for certain kinds of calculations—particularly some to do with unpicking codes and simulating natural systems.\\n\\nSo far, so good. But it turns out that building real qubits and getting information in and out of them is extremely difficult, because interactions with the outside world can destroy the delicate quantum states inside.\\n\\nResearchers have tried a lot of different technologies to make qubits, using things like atoms trapped in electric fields or eddies of current swirling in superconductors.\\n\\nTiny Wires and Exotic Particles\\n\\nMicrosoft has taken a very different approach to build its “topological qubits.” They have used what are called Majorana particles, first theorized in 1937 by Italian physicist Ettore Majorana.\\n\\nMajoranas are not naturally occurring particles like electrons or protons. Instead, they only exist inside a rare kind of material called a topological superconductor (which requires advanced material design and must be cooled down to extremely low temperatures).'},\n",

Today, the process is driven by a conveyor belt, and, for the most part, it’s automatic. The most urgent task for humans is to figure out when things are going wrong—and even that could soon be handed over to AI.\\n\\nThe Schaeffler factory in Hamburg starts with steel wire that is cut and pressed into rough balls. Those balls are hardened in a series of furnaces, and then put through three increasingly precise grinders until they are spherical to within a tenth of a micron. The result is one of the most versatile components in modern industry, enabling low-friction joints in everything from lathes to car engines.\\n\\nThat level of precision requires constant testing—but when defects do turn up, tracking them down can present a puzzle. Testing might show a defect occurring at some point on the assembly line, but the cause may not be obvious. Perhaps the torque on a screwing tool is off, or a newly replaced grinding wheel is impacting quality. Tracking down the problem means comparing data across multiple pieces of industrial equipment, none of which were designed with this in mind.\\n\\nThis too may soon be a job for machines. Last year, Schaeffler became one of the first users of Microsoft’s Factory Operations Agent, a new product powered by large language models and designed specifically for manufacturers. The chatbot-style tool can help track down the causes of defects, downtime, or excess energy consumption. The result is something like ChatGPT for factories, with OpenAI’s models being used on the backend thanks to the company’s partnership with Microsoft’s Azure.\\n\\nKathleen Mitford, Microsoft’s corporate vice president for global industry marketing, describes the project as “a reasoning agent that operates on top of manufacturing data.” As a result, Mitford says, “the agent is capable of understanding questions and translating them with precision and accuracy against standardized data models.” So a factory worker might ask a question like “What is causing a higher than usual level of defects?” and the model would be able to answer with data from across the manufacturing process.\\n\\nThe agent is deeply integrated into Microsoft’s existing enterprise products, particularly Microsoft Fabric, its data analytics system. This means that Schaeffler, which runs hundreds of plants on Microsoft’s system, is able to train its agent on data from all over the world.\\n\\nStefan Soutschek, Schaeffler’s vice president in charge of IT, says the scope of data analysis is the real power of the system. “The major benefit is not the chatbot itself, although it helps,” he says. “It’s the combination of this OT [operational technology] data platform in the backend, and the chatbot relying on that data.”\\n\\nDespite the name, this isn’t agentic AI: It doesn’t have goals, and its powers are limited to answering whatever questions the user asks. You can set up the agent to execute basic commands through Microsoft’s Copilot studio, but the goal isn’t to have the agent making its own decisions. This is primarily AI as a data access tool.'},\n",

What exactly is reasoning, anyway?\\n\\nAI companies like OpenAI are using the term reasoning to mean that their models break down a problem into smaller problems, which they tackle step by step, ultimately arriving at a better solution as a result.\\n\\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

Although scientists are still trying to understand how reasoning works in the human brain — nevermind in AI — they agree that there are actually lots of different types of reasoning.\\n\\nThere’s deductive reasoning, where you start with a general statement and use it to reach a specific conclusion. There’s inductive reasoning, where you use specific observations to make a broader generalization. And there’s analogical reasoning, causal reasoning, common sense reasoning … suffice it to say, reasoning is not just one thing!\\n\\nNow, if someone comes up to you with a hard math problem and gives you a chance to break it down and think about it step by step, you’ll do a lot better than if you have to blurt out the answer off the top of your head. So, being able to do deliberative “chain-of-thought reasoning” is definitely helpful, and it might be a necessary ingredient of getting anything really difficult done. Yet it’s not the whole of reasoning.\\n\\nOne feature of reasoning that we care a lot about in the real world is the ability to suss out “a rule or pattern from limited data or experience and to apply this rule or pattern to new, unseen situations,” writes Melanie Mitchell, a professor at the Santa Fe Institute, together with her co-authors in a paper on AI’s reasoning abilities. “Even very young children are adept at learning abstract rules from just a few examples.”\\n\\nIn other words, a toddler can generalize. Can an AI?\\n\\nA lot of the debate turns around this question. Skeptics are very, well, skeptical of AI’s ability to generalize. They think something else is going on.\\n\\nThe skeptic’s case\\n\\n“It’s a kind of meta-mimicry,” Shannon Vallor, a philosopher of technology at the University of Edinburgh, told me when OpenAI’s o1 came out in September.\\n\\nShe meant that while an older model like ChatGPT mimics the human-written statements in its training data, a newer model like o1 mimics the process that humans engage in to come up with those statements. In other words, she believes, it’s not truly reasoning. It would be pretty easy for o1 to just make it sound like it’s reasoning; after all, its training data is rife with examples of that, from doctors analyzing symptoms to decide on a diagnosis to judges evaluating evidence to arrive at a verdict.\\n\\nBesides, when OpenAI built the o1 model, it made some changes from the previous ChatGPT model but did not dramatically overhaul the architecture — and ChatGPT was flubbing easy questions last year, like answering a question about how to get a man and a goat across a river in a totally ridiculous way. So why, Vallor asked, would we think o1 is doing something totally new and magical — especially given that it, too, flubs easy questions? “In the cases where it fails, you see what, for me, is compelling evidence that it’s not reasoning at all,” she said.\\n\\nMitchell was surprised at how well o3 — OpenAI’s newest reasoning model, announced at the end of last year as a successor to o1 — performed on tests. But she was also surprised at just how much computation it used to solve the problems. We don’t know what it’s doing with all that computation, because OpenAI is not transparent about what’s going on under the hood.\\n\\n“I’ve actually done my own experiments on people where they’re thinking out loud about these problems, and they don’t think out loud for, you know, hours of computation time,” she told me. “They just say a couple sentences and then say, ‘Yeah, I see how it works,’ because they’re using certain kinds of concepts. I don’t know if o3 is using those kinds of concepts.”\\n\\nWithout greater transparency from the company, Mitchell said we can’t be sure that the model is breaking down a big problem into steps and getting a better overall answer as a result of that approach, as OpenAI claims.\\n\\nShe pointed to a paper, “Let’s Think Dot by Dot,” where researchers did not get a model to break down a problem into intermediate steps; instead, they just told the model to generate dots. Those dots were totally meaningless — what the paper’s authors call “filler tokens.” But it turned out that just having additional tokens there allowed the model more computational capacity, and it could use that extra computation to solve problems better. That suggests that when a model generates intermediate steps — whether it’s a phrase like “let’s think about this step by step” or just “....” — those steps don’t necessarily mean it’s doing the human-like reasoning you think it’s doing.\\n\\n“I think a lot of what it’s doing is more like a bag of heuristics than a reasoning model,” Mitchell told me. A heuristic is a mental shortcut — something that often lets you guess the right answer to a problem, but not by actually thinking it through.\\n\\nHere’s a classic example: Researchers trained an AI vision model to analyze photos for skin cancer. It seemed, at first blush, like the model was genuinely figuring out if a mole is malignant. But it turned out the photos of malignant moles in its training data often contained a ruler, so the model had just learned to use the presence of a ruler as a heuristic for deciding on malignancy.\\n\\nSkeptical AI researchers think that state-of-the-art models may be doing something similar: They appear to be “reasoning” their way through, say, a math problem, but really they’re just drawing on a mix of memorized information and heuristics.\\n\\nThe believer’s case\\n\\nOther experts are more bullish on reasoning models. Ryan Greenblatt, chief scientist at Redwood Research, a nonprofit that aims to mitigate risks from advanced AI, thinks these models are pretty clearly doing some form of reasoning.\\n\\n“They do it in a way that doesn’t generalize as well as the way humans do it — they’re relying more on memorization and knowledge than humans do — but they’re still doing the thing,” Greenblatt said. “It’s not like there’s no generalization at all.”\\n\\nAfter all, these models have been able to solve hard problems beyond the examples they’ve been trained on — often very impressively. For Greenblatt, the simplest explanation as to how is that they are indeed doing some reasoning.\\n\\nAnd the point about heuristics can cut both ways, whether we’re talking about a reasoning model or an earlier model like ChatGPT. Consider the “a man, a boat, and a goat” prompt that had many skeptics mocking OpenAI last year:\\n\\nWhat’s going on here? Greenblatt says the model messed up because this prompt is actually a classic logic puzzle that dates back centuries and that would have appeared many times in the training data. In some formulations of the river-crossing puzzle, a farmer with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage must cross over by boat. The boat can only carry the farmer and a single item at a time — but if left together, the wolf will eat the goat or the goat will eat the cabbage, so the challenge is to get everything across without anything getting eaten. That explains the model’s mention of a cabbage in its response. The model would instantly “recognize” the puzzle.\\n\\n“My best guess is that the models have this incredibly strong urge to be like, ‘Oh, it’s this puzzle! I know what this puzzle is! I should do this because that performed really well in the training data.’ It’s like a learned heuristic,” Greenblatt said. The implication? “It’s not that it can’t solve it. In a lot of these cases, if you say it’s a trick question, and then you give the question, the model often does totally fine.”\\n\\nHumans fail in the same way all the time, he pointed out. If you’d just spent a month studying color theory — from complementary colors to the psychological effects of different hues to the historical significance of certain pigments in Renaissance paintings — and then got a quiz asking, “Why did the artist paint the sky blue in this landscape painting?”... well, you might be tricked into writing a needlessly complicated answer! Maybe you’d write about how the blue represents the divine heavens, or how the specific shade suggests the painting was done in the early morning hours which symbolizes rebirth … when really, the answer is simply: Because the sky is blue!\\n\\nAjeya Cotra, a senior analyst at Open Philanthropy who researches the risks from AI, agrees with Greenblatt on that point. And, she said of the latest models, “I think they’re genuinely getting better at this wide range of tasks that humans would call reasoning tasks.”\\n\\nShe doesn’t dispute that the models are doing some meta-mimicry. But when skeptics say “it’s just doing meta-mimicry,” she explained, “I think the ‘just’ part of it is the controversial part. It feels like what they’re trying to imply often is ‘and therefore it’s not going to have a big impact on the world’ or ‘and therefore artificial superintelligence is far away’ — and that’s what I dispute.”\\n\\nTo see why, she said, imagine you’re teaching a college physics class. You’ve got different types of students. One is an outright cheater: He just looks in the back of the book for the answers and then writes them down. Another student is such a savant that he doesn’t even need to think about the equations; he understands the physics on such a deep, intuitive, Einstein-like level that he can derive the right equations on the fly. All the other students are somewhere in the middle: They’ve memorized a list of 25 equations and are trying to figure out which equation to apply in which situation.\\n\\nLike the majority of students, AI models are pairing some memorization with some reasoning, Cotra told me.\\n\\n“The AI models are like a student that is not very bright but is superhumanly diligent, and so they haven’t just memorized 25 equations, they’ve memorized 500 equations, including ones for weird situations that could come up,” she said. They’re pairing a lot of memorization with a little bit of reasoning — that is, with figuring out what combination of equations to apply to a problem. “And that just takes you very far! They seem at first glance as impressive as the person with the deep intuitive understanding.”\\n\\nOf course, when you look harder, you can still find holes that their 500 equations just happen not to cover. But that doesn’t mean zero reasoning has taken place.\\n\\nIn other words, the models are neither exclusively reasoning nor exclusively just reciting.\\n\\n“It’s somewhere in between,” Cotra said. “I think people are thrown off by that because they want to put it in one camp or another. They want to say it’s just memorizing or they want to say it’s truly deeply reasoning. But the fact is, there’s just a spectrum of the depth of reasoning.”\\n\\nAI systems have “jagged intelligence”\\n\\nResearchers have come up with a buzzy term to describe this pattern of reasoning: “jagged intelligence.” It refers to the strange fact that, as computer scientist Andrej Karpathy explained, state-of-the-art AI models “can both perform extremely impressive tasks (e.g., solve complex math problems) while simultaneously struggling with some very dumb problems.”\\n\\nDrew Shannon for Vox\\n\\nPicture it like this. If human intelligence looks like a cloud with softly rounded edges, artificial intelligence is like a spiky cloud with giant peaks and valleys right next to each other. In humans, a lot of problem-solving capabilities are highly correlated with each other, but AI can be great at one thing and ridiculously bad at another thing that (to us) doesn’t seem far apart.\\n\\nMind you, it’s all relative.\\n\\n“Compared to what humans are good at, the models are quite jagged,” Greenblatt told me. “But I think indexing on humans is a little confusing. From the model’s perspective, it’s like, ‘Wow, those humans are so jagged! They’re so bad at next-token prediction!’ It’s not clear that there’s some objective sense in which AI is more jagged.”\\n\\nThe fact that reasoning models are trained to sound like humans reasoning makes us disposed to compare AI intelligence to human intelligence. But the best way to think of AI is probably not as “smarter than a human” or “dumber than a human” but just as “different.”\\n\\nRegardless, Cotra anticipates that sooner or later AI intelligence will be so vast that it can contain within it all of human intelligence, and then some.\\n\\n“I think about, what are the risks that emerge when AI systems are truly better than human experts at everything? When they might still be jagged, but their full jagged intelligence encompasses all of human intelligence and more?” she said. “I’m always looking ahead to that point in time and preparing for that.”\\n\\nFor now, the practical upshot for most of us is this: Remember what AI is and isn’t smart at — and use it accordingly.\\n\\nThe best use case is a situation where it’s hard for you to come up with a solution, but once you get a solution from the AI you can easily check to see if it’s correct. Writing code is a perfect example. Another example would be making a website: You can see what the AI produced and, if you don’t like it, just get the AI to redo it.\\n\\nIn other domains — especially ones where there is no objective right answer or where the stakes are high — you’ll want to be more hesitant about using AI. You might get some initial suggestions from it, but don’t put too much stock in it, especially if what it’s saying seems off to you. An example would be asking for advice on how to handle a moral dilemma. You might see what thoughts the model is provoking in you without trusting it as giving you the final answer.\\n\\n“The more things are fuzzy and judgment-driven,” Cotra said, “the more you want to use it as a thought partner, not an oracle.”'},\n",

       "   'content': 'is a Future Perfect Fellow focusing on the intersection of emerging technology, culture, and the mind. She is also fascinated by the process of science, the institutions that fund it, and the people who make it happen.\\n\\nElon Musk has arguably been the boldest broligarch when it comes to brain-machine interfaces. But Mark Zuckerberg is hot on his heels.\\n\\nSince then, Meta-funded researchers have figured out how to decode speech from activity recorded from surgically implanted electrodes inside people’s brains. While brain surgery could feel worth it for a paralyzed person who wants to regain the ability to communicate, invasive devices like these are a hard sell for someone who just wants to type faster. Commercial devices regular people might actually want need to be wearable and removable, rather than permanent.\\n\\nThis story was first featured in the Future Perfect newsletter. Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.\\n\\nMeta tabled its efforts to build consumer brain-computer interfaces a few years ago: Brain-reading headbands weren’t ready for prime time. Instead of developing new gadgets directly, the company has been investing in slower-burning neuroscience research. Their hope is that studying the brain will help them build AI that’s better at stuff humans are good at, like processing language. Some of this research still focused on mind-reading: specifically, decoding how the brain produces sentences.\\n\\nThis month, though, Meta made a breakthrough.\\n\\nIn collaboration with the Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language, researchers at Meta’s Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) lab were able to accurately decode unspoken sentences from brain signals recorded outside the skull — no surgery required.\\n\\nThis was just in a lab, of course. But these findings mark a major step toward the wearable mind-reading devices Zuckerberg promised eight years ago.\\n\\nAnd as brain-to-text devices inch closer toward commercial viability in the not-so-distant future, we’ll need to grapple with what it means for Meta to be their gatekeeper. In the lab, mind-reading technology promises to reveal previously unknowable information about how our brains construct thoughts, make decisions, and guide our actions. But out in the world, tech companies may misuse our brain data unless we establish and enforce regulations to stop them.\\n\\nMeta can decode unspoken sentences from your brain’s magnetic fields\\n\\nUntil a couple years ago, researchers couldn’t decode unspoken language without implanting electrodes inside the brain, which requires surgery. In 2023, scientists at the University of Texas used fMRI, coupled with a version of the AI models that power ChatGPT, to decode the gist of unspoken sentences from brain activity. But fMRI machines cost millions of dollars and can outweigh a fully grown elephant, limiting their usefulness outside the lab.\\n\\nBecause neuroscientists are generally unwilling to stick recording devices inside of a human’s brain, most studies of the human brain involve measuring some proxy for neural activity itself. fMRI scanners measure how much blood flows to brain cells while they work, which entails a bit of a lag. Another method, called magnetoencephalography (MEG), measures magnetic fields brain cells create when they send electrical signals. While neither of these techniques can track what individual cells are doing, they both provide a rough snapshot of the brain’s activity patterns while someone is doing a task, like reading or typing. The cool thing is that unlike fMRI, MEG can record the brain in near-real time.\\n\\nSo, Meta researchers recruited 35 volunteers to type sentences on a keyboard while sitting in an MEG scanner, which looks like a salon hair-drying chair from outer space. Some also had EEG (electroencephalography) electrodes gelled to their face and scalp to record electrical signals radiating from brain cells through their skulls.\\n\\nEach person’s brain activity helped train an AI model to guess what they typed. Essentially, part of the model learned to match patterns of brain activity to the letters someone was typing at the time. Researchers fed another part of the model a bunch of Wikipedia articles to teach it how sentences work, and what words often appear next to each other in different contexts. With this information, if someone meant to type “I love you,” but their brain signals read “I lovr yoi” — possibly because their brain actually led them to make a typo — the model could effectively autocorrect that prediction, because it knows how letters and words should work in context.\\n\\nUsing EEG, which is much more portable than an fMRI or MEG scanner, Meta researchers were able to use AI to decode the exact letters someone was typing about a third of the time. That doesn’t sound particularly impressive, until you consider that EEG records brain cells via electrodes outside the skull, many layers of separation away from the brain itself. It’s like trying to eavesdrop on a conversation at a crowded bar by standing outside and holding a glass against the wall: Given all the noise, catching even a third of that conversation is already quite challenging.\\n\\nMEG captures brain activity more precisely than EEG, because magnetic signals from brain cells don’t get as distorted by the skull as electrical signals. By feeding MEG data to their AI model, Meta researchers accurately decoded between 70 to 80 percent of what people typed, blowing previous models out of the water. So, if Meta ever wants to build mind-reading headbands, recording magnetic fields might be their best bet.\\n\\nLike fMRI, the MEG device used in this study was huge and expensive. But wearable helmet-like MEG scanners, which only weigh a few pounds, already exist and are even more sensitive than non-portable scanners. These portable MEG devices are just a couple pounds heavier than the Quest 3, Meta’s latest VR headset, and about as silly-looking. While these MEG devices still don’t work outside of special magnetically-shielded rooms (nor are they available to the public yet), it’s not hard to imagine a future where they could.\\n\\nTech companies won’t protect brain data unless we make them\\n\\nMeta isn’t the only tech giant investing heavily in neuroscience research. Google and Microsoft both have teams dedicated to studying the brain, and NVIDIA and IBM both collaborate with neuroscience research institutions.\\n\\nHere, Meta used the brain data they collected while people typed to study how the brain transforms abstract ideas into words, syllables, and letters, with the long-term goal of figuring out how to help AI chatbots do the same.\\n\\nThe data support a long-held hypothesis held by neuroscientists and linguists, proposing that we produce speech from the top down. As I prepare to say something, my brain pictures the whole thing first (“I’m going to lunch soon”), then zooms in on one word (“going”), then one syllable (“go-”). As I type, my brain focuses on each specific letter (“g,” “o,”...) as it tells my fingers what to do. Meta saw that these representations — context, words, syllables, letters — all overlap during language production, peaking and fading in strength at different times.\\n\\nUnderstanding language production will also, in theory, help Meta achieve their stated goal of “restor[ing] communication for those who have lost the ability to speak.” And there are indeed millions of people recovering from traumatic brain injury, stroke, or another neurological disorder that makes it hard to talk. A wearable device that makes communication easy again could be a hugely positive force in someone’s life.\\n\\nBut we know that’s not their only motivation. For Silicon Valley, the brain also represents the final barrier between humans and their devices.\\n\\nA quick sanity check: Meta’s goal was never to merge humans with computers (that’s Musk’s thing), but to sell a portable, removable headset that someone could use to type or play video games with their mind. To manifest a device like this, Meta needs to cross two huge technological hurdles, and one even bigger ethical one.\\n\\nFirst, they need to decode unspoken thoughts from outside the skull. Check.\\n\\nSecond, they need to do that with a device that someone could reasonably afford, keep in their house, and wear on their head. For now, this is pretty far off.\\n\\nMost importantly, once these devices exist, we’ll need robust protections for people’s cognitive liberty — our fundamental right to control our own consciousness. The time for these safeguards isn’t after they hit stores. It’s now.\\n\\n“Facebook is already great at peering into your brain without any need for electrodes or fMRI or anything. They know much of your cognitive profile just from how you use the internet,” Roland Nadler, a neuroethicist at the University of British Columbia, told my colleague Sigal Samuel back in 2019.\\n\\nMeta already uses AI to extrapolate your mental health from your digital footprint. They use AI to flag, and sometimes delete, posts about self-harm and suicide, and can trigger nonconsensual “wellness checks” when they detect concerning messages on Messenger or WhatsApp.\\n\\nGiven how much convenience we gain by giving away personal data — food deliveries, remote work, connecting with friends online — lots of people give up on digital privacy altogether. Even though many people feel uncomfortable with the amount of personal information companies take from us, they also believe they have no control over their privacy.\\n\\nLast year, neuroscientists, lawyers, and lawmakers began passing legislation to explicitly include neural data in state privacy laws. Some smaller neurotech companies are already gathering brain data from consumer products — stronger protections need to be put in place before massive companies like Meta can do the same.\\n\\nZuckerberg has spent the past two months racing to Trump-ify Meta. His company is unlikely to handle our most private data with care, at least not unprompted.\\n\\nBut in a world where Meta-branded brain-to-text headbands are as normal as keyboards are now, sharing brain data might feel like a prerequisite for participating in normal life. Imagine a workplace where, instead of giving you a monitor and a keyboard at the office, they give you a text-decoding helmet and tell you to strap in. If mind-typing becomes the default for computer systems, then avoiding brain-to-text devices will feel like avoiding smartphones: possible, sure. But certainly not the path of least resistance.\\n\\nAs our mental security becomes less guaranteed, we’ll need to decide whether the convenience of controlling stuff with our minds is worth letting tech companies colonize our last truly private space.\\n\\nA version of this story originally appeared in the Future Perfect newsletter.

       "   'title': 'Is it time to worry about bird flu?',\n",
       "   'time': '2025-02-14T12:00:00',\n",
       "   'content': 'You may have noticed egg prices going up, and even eggs being scarce. Bird flu is to blame, but it doesn’t just affect egg prices — and it doesn’t just affect birds. Avian flu is responsible for the deaths of mammals all over the globe. And this January, the US reported a human death from bird flu.\\n\\nAll this raises the question: If bird flu is killing animals right and left, and has killed at least one human, should we be worried?\\n\\nTo answer that, I spoke with dozens of experts to create the video below. I also spoke with Sean Collins, a news editor at Vox and the host of the Today, Explained newsletter, about everything I’d learned in the course of my reporting. Check out our conversation (edited for length and clarity), below.\\n\\nWhat is bird flu?\\n\\nAvian flu — or bird flu — is an influenza virus that seems to originate in waterfowl (like ducks or geese), but that can spread to any animal, including humans. When waterfowl spread the virus — usually through their droppings or bodily fluids — we can see some pretty bad effects in birds. In domesticated poultry, we see an almost 100 percent mortality rate.\\n\\nAre we in a bird flu pandemic?\\n\\nThe term pandemic tends to refer to the unchecked spread of a disease among humans; experts told me what we’re seeing here is a panzootic, which is essentially a pandemic that affects animals. This strain of bird flu is on every continent except Australia — and Australia has its own deadly strain going around. It’s also in our waters. It’s in dolphins, in seals, and in sea lions — in 2023, 24,000 sea lions washed up in South America, dead from avian flu.\\n\\nThe flu has been devastating for poultry populations. You see birds acting almost like they’re drunk, struggling to walk, before they just collapse. To try to stop the spread, farms are mass culling chickens, often in horrible ways.\\n\\nThe amount of mammals that bird flu is infecting right now is astronomical.\\n\\nDo humans have to worry about this sparking a pandemic?\\n\\nHumans can get bird flu. Infections that have crossed over into humans are typically mild, but worth monitoring: At least one person has died from this, though experts see that death as an outlier.\\n\\nThere are lots of viruses out there that make animals sick, but that don’t pose a threat to humans because they don’t have the characteristics needed for human-to-human spread. Right now, you can catch bird flu from an animal, but you’re not going to give it to somebody else. Unless that changes, we’re not in pandemic territory.\\n\\nThe thing experts are keeping an eye on is the amount of contact humans (and species that have a lot in common with humans) have with infected animals. The more contact this strain of bird flu has with various animals, the more opportunities it has to replicate. With each replication comes the possibility for genetic reassortment and mutations — basically for changes to the virus’s structure that could alter its characteristics. Those changes could make it into something that spreads more easily among humans.\\n\\nThat’s a lot of coulds, which is why, while you should know that avian flu does have pandemic potential, you shouldn’t panic about it.\\n\\nWhat can people do to protect themselves?\\n\\nBe aware that the flu is circulating among animals we’re frequently around, like chickens and cows. If you work on a farm, some experts are advising PPE, particularly for dairy and poultry professionals.\\n\\nDon’t consume animal products that haven’t undergone safety treatments. That means don’t — do not — drink raw milk. Pasteurized milk is very safe.

       "   'content': 'is a senior reporter for Vox’s Future Perfect section, with a focus on animal welfare and the future of meat.\\n\\nH5N1, a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza known as bird flu, continues to wreak havoc on the nation’s egg farms. In just the last month, more than 21.2 million egg-laying hens — about 7 percent of the national flock — have fallen prey to the virus or been brutally killed by egg producers in an effort to slow its spread. It’s led to egg shortages and a spike in egg prices, which reached $5 per dozen on average in January, up from under $2 in 2021, before the current bird flu outbreak began.\\n\\nLast week, in an effort to boost egg supply, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo signed into law a bill that allows government officials to temporarily suspend the state’s cage-free egg standards, which requires eggs sold in the state to come from hens raised in cage-free barns rather than in the tiny, cramped cages that are predominant in the egg industry. It also allows for the temporary retail sale of Grade B eggs, which are safe to eat but may come with minor imperfections.\\n\\nLombardo has said he wants to repeal Nevada’s cage-free standards altogether.\\n\\nThis story was first featured in the Processing Meat newsletter Sign up here for Future Perfect’s biweekly newsletter from Marina Bolotnikova and Kenny Torrella, exploring how the meat and dairy industries shape our health, politics, culture, environment, and more. Have questions or comments on this newsletter? Email us at futureperfect@vox.com!\\n\\nLast month, state lawmakers in Michigan and Colorado introduced bills to do just that in their states. Colorado’s bill is dead, while Michigan’s bill is still in committee.\\n\\nThese bills are part of a much larger, longer-term trend attempting to dismantle what little progress has been made on farm animal welfare in the US. For years, livestock industry-friendly members of Congress have pushed for the EATS Act, which would ban states from setting their own standards for livestock products imported from other states, thereby nullifying some of the most important farm animal welfare laws in the country.\\n\\nIt’s unlikely that efforts to repeal and suspend cage-free egg laws will lower egg prices, because there’s already little slack in the national egg supply. The whole country is facing egg shortages, so there’s not exactly a surplus of eggs lying around to fill the gap in Nevada, Michigan, and other cage-free states. University of Arkansas agricultural economist Jada Thompson recently told the Associated Press that Nevada’s suspension could “very slightly” ease egg prices in the state, but could also raise prices in other states by diverting some of the national egg supply to Nevada.\\n\\nColorado’s agriculture commissioner recently said the state’s cage-free law is not a significant factor in the shortages or price spikes. The head of the trade group Colorado Egg Producers told local media that the repeal bill “would actually harm our farmers here in the State of Colorado, and it would jeopardize the investments they’ve already made” in cage-free egg farming.\\n\\nIt’s an issue that both egg farmers and animal welfare advocates agree on: “Repealing state bans on cages won’t stop the spread of bird flu,” said Hannah Truxell, senior policy counsel of the animal protection group the Humane League, in a statement to Vox. “It would, however, reverse years of critical food industry progress.”\\n\\nThat progress is the rapid transition the egg industry has undertaken since the early 2000s, when virtually all egg-laying hens were confined in tiny cages that restricted them from even flapping their wings, let alone moving around. Today, 40 percent of the egg industry’s 304 million hens are cage-free, due to laws in 11 US states and commitments from major food corporations, including McDonald’s and Nestlé, to use only cage-free eggs. The shift has reduced suffering for around 100 million hens annually.\\n\\nThe US pioneered the development of factory farming. Rich Pedroncelli/Associated Press\\n\\nTo be sure, cage-free doesn’t mean the animals have good lives — they’re still raised in massive, overcrowded, unsanitary barns, and investigations into cage-free farms have revealed horrid conditions. But they’re certainly better than conventional cage farms.\\n\\nRepealing the few laws that ban cages will do nothing to address the core food system vulnerability driving egg shortages — dependence on factory farms. Because these egg farms are so enormous, each housing hundreds of thousands or even millions of animals, a virus infecting just a couple operations can send a shock to the food supply overnight. Tearing up cage-free laws to compensate for that vulnerability will only further punish animals in the relentless pursuit of cheap food — a pursuit that is to blame for much of this mess, as poultry factory farms have supercharged the bird flu virus.\\n\\nAs experts increasingly worry that bird flu could boil over to create the next global pandemic, now ought to be a time for sober reflection on the risks factory farming poses, rather than a time to double down on it.\\n\\nBird flu is largely a problem of the factory farm industry’s own making\\n\\nOver the last century, the US pioneered the development of factory farming, which has since spread around the globe. It has made meat, milk, and eggs more abundant and affordable, but it has also come with a number of environmental, animal welfare, and public health problems, including accelerating the spread and virulence of H5N1.\\n\\nThe vast majority of America’s more than 9 billion turkeys, chickens, and egg-laying hens are raised on factory farms, where the genetically similar animals are overcrowded and live among their own waste, all of which can compromise their immune systems.\\n\\nFactory farms present a “huge opportunity” for a virus or microbe to effectively spread, Claas Kirchhelle, a medical historian at the University College Dublin, told me.\\n\\nInfluenzas have long circulated among migratory water birds, but these have historically been “low-pathogenic” strains, inflicting little to no damage to the wild birds who contract and spread it. But the virus can mutate from a low-pathogenic strain to a high-pathogenic one — which causes fatal infections in poultry birds and more effectively spreads to humans. These high-pathogenicity conversion events have occurred 42 times between 1959 and today — and almost all were first detected on poultry factory farms.\\n\\nExperts believe that H5N1, first detected in China in 1996, converted from low to high-pathogenicity after entering a commercial poultry farm. By the early 2000s, the virus had spread across the globe. The current US outbreak, now going on three years, has mutated to cause severe illness and death in hundreds of bird species, mammals such as seals and sea lions, and, in the US, dairy cows. More than 70 pet cats, many of them living on dairy farms, have fallen ill from bird flu, and some died. In December, a cheetah and a mountain lion at the Arizona zoo died from the bird flu.\\n\\nA pile of dead cows by the roadside in California’s San Joaquin Valley. The photographer said the farm owner had told her his herd had been infected with bird flu. California accounts for over 700 of the nation’s nearly 1,000 dairy cattle herds that have caught the disease. Crystal Heath\\n\\nNearly 70 Americans have contracted the virus since 2022. Most of them have been dairy or poultry farmworkers, and most cases have been mild. But in January, a Louisiana resident died after exposure to backyard chickens and wild birds. And this winter, a 13-year-old Canadian girl caught a severe bird flu infection and was hospitalized for weeks; it’s unknown how she got it.\\n\\nLast week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that three dairy veterinarians tested positive for H5N1 despite showing no symptoms, suggesting the virus could be more prevalent in humans than we think. Days later, a Wyoming resident with a flock of backyard chickens was hospitalized after testing positive for avian influenza.\\n\\nThrough it all, the US poultry and dairy industries have had little incentive to change their disease-promoting business models.\\n\\nPolicy incentives give them no reason to: When bird flu strikes a US poultry farm, the US Department of Agriculture covers the cost of the mass killing of the birds — which is often done by shutting off ventilation and using heaters so that the birds slowly, painfully die of heatstroke — along with the costs of carcass disposal and the market value of the birds. Since 2022, the USDA had doled out more than $1 billion in taxpayer dollars to egg producers affected by the virus. Dairy producers with bird flu outbreaks are also paid for their losses.\\n\\nThese bailouts — along with the current attempts to nullify cage-free laws — send a message to the industry that policymakers won’t question the foundational risks of the factory farm system, and will instead continually accommodate for those risks. Temporarily suspending state cage-free egg laws may bring very slight, short-term relief on egg prices, but without pairing it with longer-term solutions, we are bound to end up here again, or worse. Influenza experts are increasingly concerned that the evolution and spread of the virus over the last few years — aided by dairy farmers unwilling to take the bird flu threat seriously and a deferential USDA — could help to trigger the next global pandemic.\\n\\nIn a recent story for Nautilus, journalist Brandon Keim wrote that scientists he spoke with “used phrases like ‘red lights flashing,’ ‘totally novel ballgame,’ ‘no hope of containing,’ and ‘under attack.’”\\n\\nReforming America’s livestock-dependent policy regime\\n\\nThere are a number of short- and long-term steps policymakers could take to lower the threat of bird flu.\\n\\nIn December, the USDA said that some producers may be “inclined to disregard biosecurity because they believe that [the USDA] will continue to cover the costs associated with damages related to an HPAI outbreak.” The agency has proposed a rule to require that producers pass a biosecurity audit before they’re eligible for indemnity payments.\\n\\nBut Congress could go further by requiring producers to cover their own costs for mass killing and disposing of animals in the wake of disease outbreaks — a policy that Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) proposed over two years ago in the Industrial Agriculture Accountability Act.\\n\\n“Our federal agricultural policy is designed in such a way that the factory farm model gets all the benefits and none of the blame,” Jake Davis, a Missouri-based agricultural policy expert and small farmer who advised on the bill, told Vox in 2022. “We have not asked the industry to embed the risk to our food system that they create.”\\n\\nAs egg prices soar, there’s been increased appetite for such alternatives in the US.\\n\\nRequiring the vaccination of egg-laying hens would help, but parts of the poultry industry are concerned it would disrupt trade, while the USDA — at the tail end of the Biden administration — expressed concerns about the effectiveness of available vaccines. A Trump economic adviser recently said the new administration is looking into “medication” — presumably meaning vaccines — as part of its plan to stamp out the virus, and last week gave conditional approval to an H5N1 vaccine. But it’s unclear when, or if, it’ll be deployed. The Trump administration has also fired 25 percent of the staff from a network of nearly 60 laboratories that monitor the bird flu and other viruses, some of whom it’s now trying to hire back.\\n\\nLonger term, policymakers could invest in diversifying America’s protein sources — currently, two-thirds of our protein intake comes from animal products. Fewer animals and fewer factory farms would give avian influenza and other viruses fewer opportunities to mutate and spread, while also benefitting the environment and the animals themselves.\\n\\nCongress, the USDA and FDA, and state governments helped to build — and still help to expand — the factory farm system. But policymakers could choose to shift the food system in a more plant-based direction. Forward-thinking countries like Denmark and the Netherlands are already doing so through programs to pay farmers to raise fewer animals or grow more plant-based crops and to support startups producing plant-based meat, milk, and egg alternatives.\\n\\nAs egg prices soar, there’s been increased appetite for such alternatives in the US. Josh Tetrick, the CEO of Eat Just — the maker of a plant-based liquid egg product called Just Egg, which is made with mung bean protein — told me over email that the product has been growing five times faster over the past month than in the past year. And one of the largest US retailers, Tetrick said, increased its orders of the product by 30 percent over the last three weeks.\\n\\nJust Egg is pricey, costing about triple that of liquid eggs from a caged hen, but it’s not because mung beans are expensive; it’s because it’s made by a startup that hasn’t achieved economies of scale, nor benefited from taxpayer bailouts or decades of government support like the conventional egg industry. If commercial egg farming does contribute to sparking the global pandemic, investing in plant-based alternatives will look smart in hindsight.\\n\\nAs Eat Just put it in a full-page New York Times advertisement in 2023: “Plants don’t get the flu.”'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Found in the forests of Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and Eastern Australia, birds of paradise are famous for flashy feathers and unusually shaped ornaments, which set the standard for haute couture among birds. Many use these feathers for flamboyant mating displays in which they shape-shift into otherworldly forms.\\n\\nAs if this didn’t attract enough attention, we’ve now learned that they also glow in the dark.\\n\\nBiofluorescent organisms are everywhere, from mushrooms to fish to reptiles and amphibians, but few birds have been identified as having glowing feathers. This is why biologist Rene Martin of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln wanted to investigate. She and her team studied a treasure trove of specimens at the American Museum of Natural History, which have been collected since the 1800s, and found that 37 of the 45 known species of birds of paradise have feathers that fluoresce.\\n\\nThe glow factor of birds of paradise is apparently important for mating displays. Despite biofluorescence being especially prominent in males, attracting a mate might not be all it is useful for, as these birds might also use it to signal to each other in other ways and sometimes even for camouflage among the light and shadows.\\n\\n“The current very limited number of studies reporting fluorescence in birds suggests this phenomenon has not been thoroughly investigated,” the researchers said in a study that was recently published in Royal Society Open Science.\\n\\nGlow-up\\n\\nHow do they get that glow? Biofluorescence is a phenomenon that happens when shorter, high-energy wavelengths of light, meaning UV, violet, and blue, are absorbed by an organism. The energy then gets re-emitted at longer, lower-energy wavelengths—greens, yellows, oranges, and reds. The feathers of birds of paradise contain fluorophores, molecules that undergo biofluorescence. Specialized filters in the light-sensitive cells of their eyes make their visual system more sensitive to biofluorescence.'},\n",

But when it smashes the shells of its prey, these fists come out of it undamaged.\\n\\nWhen throwing punches, mantis shrimp can strike at the speed of a .22 caliber bullet (about 1,316 kmph or 818 mph)—one of the fastest movements in the animal kingdom. That generates a force over a thousand times their body weight. However, unleashing that much energy can backfire because the shockwaves it produces could seriously damage an animal’s soft tissue. None of that seems to affect the mantis shrimp. Now we finally know why.\\n\\nWhen a team of researchers from Northwestern University studied the dactyl clubs of one mantis shrimp species, they found that they have layered structures that selectively block sound waves, acting as protective gear against vibrations that could otherwise harm the shrimp. These types of structures, known as phononic mechanisms, filter out sound waves that could otherwise cause nerve and soft tissue trauma.\\n\\n“Together, these region-specific mechanisms form a synergistic protection system that withstands repeated high-intensity impacts without substantial damage,” the researchers said in a study recently published in Science.\\n\\nBeyond body armor\\n\\nMantis shrimp are neither mantids nor shrimp. They are actually stomatopods, predatory marine crustaceans that first emerged 400 million years ago and feed on mollusks, fish, cnidarians, and other crustaceans.

Get news about destinations, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, and where to stay.\\n\\nCNN —\\n\\nAustralian people have a reputation for being hardy and fearless — after all, when you live in a country that has every kind of poisonous snake and spider known to man, not to mention the elusive predator known as the drop bear, it probably takes a lot to freak out.\\n\\nUntil, that is, a certain bird appears.\\n\\nIt’s not just any bird that strikes fear into the heart of Aussies. The cassowary is one of the world’s largest birds, and it looks like a relic from another geologic era. It’s as tall as a person, has glossy black feathers and piercing eyes, walks on two feet, can weigh up to 140 pounds and has a large dagger-like claw on each foot.\\n\\n“There’s just something primeval about them,” says Andrew Mack, who spent five years studying cassowaries in the wild in Papua New Guinea. “They look like living dinosaurs.”\\n\\nCassowaries are ratites, meaning they are flightless. They’ve also earned the dubious distinction of being “the world’s most dangerous bird.”\\n\\nIts more famous flightless cousin, the emu, is one of Australia’s national symbols. But cassowaries, which mostly keep to themselves and live in the deep rainforest where they’re less likely to encounter humans, are now endangered.\\n\\nWhile cassowaries are known for their dramatic appearance, they are also important parts of the ecosystem of the rainforest. As the world’s largest frugivore (fruit-eater), cassowaries eat and digest dozens of fruits every day, then poop them out, which helps seeds spread and regrow throughout the forest.\\n\\nThey are also the rare animal species where males do the majority of infant care. Female cassowaries lay eggs and then leave the nest, so males incubate the eggs and then raise the young chicks. They’re very protective of their young — some of the only non-food related encounters between humans and cassowaries occurred when a person got too close to the chicks.\\n\\nHow to be ‘cass-o-wary’\\n\\nLast year, a viral video showed a woman in Queensland trying to keep her McDonald’s burger out of the claws of a hungry cassowary.\\n\\nWhile these creatures look large and intimidating, Peter Rowles says, “Many more cassowaries die from humans than humans die from cassowaries.”\\n\\nRowles is the founder of the Community for Coastal & Cassowary Conservation, shortened to “C4.” He is a longtime resident of Mission Beach, a seaside community in northern Queensland near the Daintree National Park, the primary Australian habitat for cassowaries.\\n\\n“If you encounter a cassowary in the wild, first thing is put your hands behind your back,” he says.\\n\\n“Be as boring as you can be, so you’re not attracting that cassowary’s attention. Move behind a tree. Just blend into the environment. Don’t scream and yell and wave your arms around. If you’ve got food in your hand, put it in your pocket, put it behind you, put it out of sight. It’s better to do that and be boring than to be seen as a potential source of more food.”\\n\\nWhile a human who runs into a cassowary might feel the urge to run screaming in the opposite direction, that’s actually counterproductive.\\n\\nLike their cousins the emus and ostriches, cassowaries are bipeds who can run as quickly as the average person.\\n\\nAnd while it also may be tempting to drop your food before fleeing into the night, cassowary experts say that the woman in the viral video who wanted to keep her Big Mac for herself was doing the right thing.\\n\\nA 2001 study in the Journal of Zoology cited humans giving food to cassowaries as the cause of 75% of dangerous encounters between the two species.\\n\\n“The feeding of cassowaries appears to change their natural behavior, making them bold and aggressive,” study author Christopher P. Kofron wrote, adding that “in the single fatal attack, the victim was trying to kill the cassowary.”\\n\\nIn Papua New Guinea, cassowaries are not a protected species and locals will roast and eat the birds if they catch them. The cassowaries there are the smaller dwarf species.\\n\\nRowles suggests that humans who want to keep far away from cassowaries while visiting tropical Queensland avoid black or dark blue cars — in the past, cassowaries have seen themselves reflected in the metal and freaked out, thinking a rival bird was nearby. They sometimes have similar reactions around mirrors or glazed windows, so locals in Mission Beach put up screens to block the glare.\\n\\nWhen C4 was first founded, the team put up a statue of a male cassowary outside their office. A female cassowary then showed up, trying to “court” the male. She took his “rejection” rather personally.\\n\\n“On the third day, (she) basically said, ‘Well, if you’re not going to mate with me, then you’re a competitor in my space,’ and proceeded to kick our poor old fiberglass cassowary and basically punctured it in the chest and beat it down.”\\n\\nThe repaired statue now lives in a safer space, inside the C4 office.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"Among the barrage of misinformation that circulated during the pandemic was a baseless idea that young athletes who had recently been vaccinated were dropping dead from heart issues as a result. The claim has been repeatedly debunked as details about individual cases were revealed, and scientific research has found no link between Covid vaccines and cardiac arrest, a condition in which the heart suddenly stops.\\n\\nA six-year study published Monday puts any lingering skepticism to rest.\\n\\nThe study, in the journal JAMA Network Open, compared episodes of sudden cardiac arrest and cardiac deaths among young, competitive athletes before the pandemic — from 2017 to 2019 — with those from 2020 to 2022. The numbers were relatively similar, the results showed: 203 cardiac arrests or deaths occurred before the pandemic, followed by 184 during.\\n\\nThe dataset included athletes ages 10 to 34, identified through a surveillance program led by the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research.\\n\\nThe study’s author, Dr. Jonathan Drezner, said the findings invalidate erroneous claims made on social media during the pandemic.\\n\\n“I think the results speak for themselves. There was really no change in the overall frequency of sudden cardiac arrest and death in young athletes across the U.S.,” said Drezner, director of the Center for Sports Cardiology at the University of Washington.\\n\\nDr. Aaron Baggish, a cardiologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital Heart Center, who was not involved in the study, said the new research should “make it clear to everyone, even naysayers, that Covid was not a particularly difficult virus for young, healthy people, and that the vaccine did much more good than harm.”\\n\\nA key piece of fuel for those against vaccines was a widely circulated video compilation in 2021 that showed news reports of athletes collapsing, set to ominous music. The video was posted on the website of “The HighWire,” an internet talk show founded by anti-vaccine activist Del Bigtree. Bigtree served as the communications director for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s presidential campaign last year. Kennedy is now the secretary of health and human services and responsible for overseeing federal policy on vaccines and infectious disease research.\\n\\nConspiracy theories about Covid vaccines’ effects on athletes reignited in 2023, when the Buffalo Bills' Damar Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest during a game. Social media posts attributing his medical emergency to Covid vaccines amassed millions of views. Afterward, then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson claimed that two researchers had detected a rise in cardiac arrests in European sports leagues after the Covid vaccines became available. But the research in question turned out to be a letter to the editor citing junk science.\\n\\nAbout six months after Hamlin’s episode, Bronny James, basketball star LeBron James’ son, suffered a cardiac arrest during basketball practice at the University of Southern California. At the time, Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo suggested, without evidence, that the incident was linked to USC players being “forced or misled into taking a vaccine ... proven to cause cardiac injury.”\\n\\nSeveral studies prior to Drezner’s have shown that Covid vaccines aren’t linked to deadly heart problems. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last year analyzed nearly 1,300 death certificates among people ages 16 to 30 on which the listed causes were heart issues or unknown, and found that no deaths could be definitively attributed to heart problems within 100 days of getting a Covid shot. A 2023 study also found no link between Covid vaccines and sudden cardiac arrest in athletes.\\n\\nCovid vaccines do come with a very small risk of myocarditis — inflammation of the heart muscle — but the risk is much higher after an infection with the virus itself. When the heart muscle is inflamed, it can cause an irregular heartbeat, which can lead to cardiac arrest. In Drezner’s study, myocarditis was responsible for three cases of sudden cardiac death before the pandemic and four cases during.\\n\\nIn the early days of the pandemic, some doctors worried that a Covid infection might bring an outsized risk of myocarditis compared to other respiratory viruses, and that high-intensity exercise could make athletes particularly vulnerable. But in the end, Drezner said, researchers found that the risk was similar to that of other viruses.\\n\\nOn rare occasions, high-intensity workouts may put enough stress on the heart to trigger cardiac arrest, regardless of one’s Covid history. However, most cases of cardiac arrest in young people are linked to an underlying heart problem such as a genetic disease or a defect that has been present since birth.\\n\\nFor about 30% of the young athletes in Drezner’s study who experienced cardiac arrest, the event did not even occur when they were exercising. That’s not surprising, according to Dr. Neel Chokshi, medical director of Penn Medicine’s Sports Cardiology and Fitness Program, who wasn’t involved in the study.\\n\\n“We’ve noticed that oftentimes ... it’s not during actual exercise or strenuous activity, but it can happen at any time,” he said.\\n\\nOne limitation of the new study, Chokshi said, is that there’s no mandatory reporting of cardiac arrests in athletes, so the researchers relied on reports from new outlets, social media, schools and programs that collect such data. That means some cases could be missed, he said, though it shouldn’t affect the comparison between pandemic and pre-pandemic years, since cases could be missing from both periods.\\n\\n“If there were a lot of adverse events or negative effects from Covid or the vaccines, we should see a spike,” he said. “There’s just no evidence of that.”\\n\\nToday, doctors recommend that athletes who have Covid avoid exercise until their symptoms clear up, then gradually ease back into physical activity. Whereas competitive athletes used to wait up to six months to resume sports if they developed myocarditis, doctors changed the guidelines last week to allow them to return to competition months sooner if their symptoms and inflammation resolve.\"},\n",

If Warner Bros. wanted to avoid a P.R. nightmare and not break the hearts of children everywhere, then it was clear: Someone had to free Keiko — or at least try.\\n\\nKeiko was hardly an ideal candidate for release. He’d lived in the care of humans for more than a decade, since he was a calf. He had millions of human fans but not a single orca friend. And he had missed out on uncountable lessons about how to live in the ocean — skills no trainer in the world knew how to teach.\\n\\n“The Good Whale” tells the story of the wildly ambitious science experiment to return Keiko to the ocean — while the world watched. An epic tale that starts in Mexico and ends in Norway, the six-episode series follows Keiko as he’s transported from country to country, each time landing in the hands of well-intentioned people who believe they know what’s best for him — people who still disagree, decades later, about whether they did the right thing.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'In the early, uncertain days of the coronavirus pandemic, scientists delivered one comforting pronouncement: The virus that caused COVID mutates rather slowly. If that remained true, the virus would not change much to become more dangerous soon, and any vaccine could provide years of durable protection.\\n\\nWhat actually happened was that SARS-CoV-2 began mutating quickly, first to be more transmissible and then to evade our immunity, causing breakthrough infections and reinfections. Five years and an alphanumeric soup of variants later, most of us have gotten COVID at least once. The vaccine is still being updated to match new circulating variants. And the virus itself is still changing.\\n\\nIn truth, scientists were both right and wrong about the speed at which SARS-CoV-2 mutates. The rate of mutations as this virus jumps from person to person is indeed unimpressive. But scientists were not aware of a second, accelerated evolutionary track: When SARS-CoV-2 infects a single immunocompromised patient, it can persist for months, accumulating countless mutations in that time.\\n\\nAnd if we are unlucky, that highly mutated virus might spread to others. This is the likely origin of Omicron, which appeared in fall 2021 with more than 50 mutations—an astounding evolutionary leap. Omicron looked like it had achieved four or five years’ worth of expected evolution in just months, Jesse Bloom, who studies viral evolution at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, told me at the time. These mutations enabled Omicron to cause a massive wave of infections even among the vaccinated.\\n\\nScientists now believe that chronic infections in immunocompromised patients are a key driver of variants in Omicron and beyond. Even as COVID surveillance has faded in urgency, researchers are watching chronic infections for signs of what’s to come.\\n\\nIn retrospect, clues were there from the beginning. At the start of the pandemic, researchers in New York, including Harm van Bakel, a geneticist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, began sequencing viruses from cancer patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in March and April 2020—and then kept testing positive for up to two months. The patients couldn’t clear the virus because their immune systems had been weakened by disease and by cancer treatments they received. The study, published in December 2020, concluded that immunocompromised patients with COVID might need long isolation periods, lest they unwittingly spread the virus. (These chronic infections in people who are immunocompromised are distinct from long COVID, which doesn’t necessarily involve continual shedding of virus.)\\n\\nThat same month, a preprint from a group led by Ravindra Gupta in the U.K. connected more of the dots. Gupta and his colleagues had found an immunocompromised patient with a lingering infection who was treated with antibodies from COVID survivors, only for the virus to acquire curious new mutations. Two mutations in particular gave the virus a slight edge in infectivity and antibody evasion. An immunocompromised host, the authors suggested, could provide the ideal viral training ground: A weakened immune system cannot wipe out the virus but can put up just enough defense for the virus to learn its tricks. In this case, the infused antibodies from COVID survivors likely contributed to whatever defenses the patient himself had, but even together they were not enough to completely clear the infection.\\n\\nThe virus from that particular patient probably didn’t spread far, if at all; most do not. But countless chronic infections all around the world subjecting the virus to similar immune defenses could ultimately lead to the same battle-tested mutations showing up over and over again. Indeed, mutations similar to the two in the U.K. patient soon showed up in variants such as Alpha and Omicron that did sweep around the world, Gupta told me recently. And in 2021, multiple alarming variants were found to have a different mutation that researchers in New York first observed in immunocompromised patients way back at the beginning of the pandemic. (Researchers at Mount Sinai, led by van Bakel and Viviana Simon, did match a minor variant from an immunocompromised patient to other infections in the New York City area, though it didn’t seem to spread much beyond that.)\\n\\nNone of the more notorious COVID variants has been directly traced to a single immunocompromised patient. But indirect evidence has accumulated over time that many variants do develop this way. Chronic infections, scientists have now observed over and over, create a distinct pattern of mutations: an overabundance of changes in the spike protein (which helps penetrate human cells) but not in the rest of the virus. This pattern is clearly found in both BA.1 and BA.2 versions of Omicron, as well as the variant that gave rise to JN.1, which drove last winter’s COVID surge. Bloom now says he has “very high confidence” that these variants came from chronic infections. The evidence is not as clear with other variants, he told me, but they could very well have evolved in the same way.\\n\\nLong before COVID, Bloom had tracked the evolution of influenza during chronic infections in four immunocompromised patients; some mutations in these patients eventually showed up in the seasonal flu. I wrote about the study when it was published in 2017, intrigued by the possibility that chronic infections could predict changes in flu from year to year. At the time, this was quite a novel idea.\\n\\nFlu and COVID evolution do differ in important ways, but chronic COVID infections, too, are now being examined as harbingers of the future. “Those will actually teach us a lot about the future tricks SARS-CoV-2 will come up with,” says Simon, a microbiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. To discover what those might be, she and van Bakel are now leading a research project to create better tools for sequencing chronic infections and to better understand which immunocompromised patients are most at risk for carrying them. What they find could be a preview for the future of COVID.'},\n",

Joseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nTens of thousands of federal workers have been fired recently, and more may be in danger of being let go.\\n\\nUmair Irfan — a climate change, energy policy, and science correspondent for Vox — has been specifically focused on layoffs looming over the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of late. His reporting presents a great lens for understanding the firings, and he and I discussed what the NOAA can tell us about the effect federal reductions have on everyday Americans. Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below.\\n\\nUmair, what’s NOAA and why is it so important?\\n\\nNOAA is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It’s tasked with developing weather forecasts for the United States, conducting oceanographic and atmospheric research, and developing long-term climate and weather models. It’s also in charge of fisheries and promoting commerce, particularly in the oceans, which means it does a lot of navigation and mapping work for shipping, and for offshore oil and gas drilling.\\n\\nThere have been reports that as much as half of NOAA staff might be dismissed. What would everyday Americans lose if that happened?\\n\\nNOAA has a staff of about 12,000 people, most of them scientists and engineers. If you lost half of that, you’d lose a lot of people doing the research that informs our weather forecasts and our understanding of weather, as well as a lot of the data that industry players rely on for things like aviation and air travel. We’d also lose a lot of our emergency forecasting capability for extreme weather.\\n\\nNOAA is one of the reasons that air travel is so safe, and one of the reasons that we’ve seen fewer people dying in natural disasters in the US: It has done the work of putting satellites into space, of having scientific ships on the ocean, and aircraft that fly into hurricanes, and has used its decades of data gathering to develop excellent forecasting capability — and one that, through continual work, is improving all the time.\\n\\nIf we lose all those capabilities, we lose a lot of progress that has been made. Extreme weather will stay dangerous, however, and our ability to drive the risks involved with weather down over time will eventually diminish if we don’t continue to invest in that.\\n\\nNOAA obviously isn’t the only agency that’s facing cuts here. Do Americans gain anything by shrinking the government the way Trump has been?\\n\\nCurrent and former agency staffers and leaders I talked to say the cuts aren’t going to help agencies accomplish their missions, and will actually run counter to any goals of efficiency, because remaining employees will have to try to fulfill the functions of their fired colleagues in suboptimal ways.\\n\\nThat said, there’s always going to be room to optimize a big institution like the government. But we need to do so thoughtfully, stepping back and seeing what our needs are, and what our expectations are from government in general.\\n\\nSpecifically looking at an agency like NOAA, it’s about looking carefully at exactly how its core functions are being met, where they’re falling short, and where they can be augmented. So far, we really haven’t seen that level of exploration and interest in how these agencies function from the current administration.\\n\\nBig picture, what do you think Americans should learn from the case of NOAA?\\n\\nI think it’s easy to forget that the federal government is everywhere in our country — 80 percent of federal employees are not in DC.\\n\\nNOAA is one of those agencies that has a very far-flung footprint, because it has to do a lot of the local research and data gathering on site, and because its mission is to protect the whole country.\\n\\nAnd NOAA, like all agencies, is very closely linked to people’s lives in ways they may not expect. You may not have a NOAA app on your phone, but very likely the weather app you do have, and the forecast that you’re getting from your local TV meteorologist, are informed by NOAA’s satellites and data gathering.\\n\\nWhile there may be layers in between the products you consume and the government, it does provide the foundation for things we take for granted. If agencies like NOAA go away, we would definitely lose things we might not expect.\\n\\nRelated Elon Musk is coming for our weather service'},\n",

Rebecca also serves on the board of the Society of Environmental Journalists.\\n\\nWorsening wildfires mean everyone should have a basic understanding of how to read and respond to the Air Quality Index. It’s a good idea to reduce outdoor exercise on hazardous air days to cut down on exposure.

At Vox, our mission is to help everyone access essential information that empowers them. Support our journalism by becoming a member today.\\n\\nIt’s not enough to trust the senses to know when it’s a bad air day. Well before you can see or smell smoke, it can start wreaking havoc on the lungs.\\n\\nThat haze you can see and smell on a particularly polluted day is made of ozone and fine particulate matter.\\n\\nFine particulate matter, known as PM2.5 (the 2.5 microns describes its size, 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair) can embed in the cells of the lung and the bloodstream, aggravating inflammation, asthma, heart disease, and mental health. And ozone causes similar damage. In the stratosphere, ozone blocks ultraviolet radiation from the sun, but at ground level it can cause shortness of breath and damage to respiratory tissue.\\n\\nBoth pollutants can affect the entire body in all stages of life: young and old, and even the developing fetus. They come from sources as varied as the tailpipe of a truck, your neighbor’s barbecue, coal plant, or an incinerator. PM2.5 is capable of traveling thousands of miles across the world on the wind — taking, for instance, about five days to reach the US from China.\\n\\nThe dose makes the poison; there is a difference between moderately bad air and really bad air. Public health experts recommend monitoring changes in air quality as often as you check the weather. But you should also know some basic facts to help you determine your own sensitivity to air pollution and the appropriate action to take.\\n\\nWhat is the Air Quality Index?\\n\\nThe Air Quality Index, set by the Environmental Protection Agency, is your guide to how bad the air quality is outdoors. The data that goes into the Air Quality Index comes from 5,000 air monitors across the country, including local, state, tribal, and federal reporting.\\n\\nThere are actually two AQIs for air quality, one for particulate matter and one for ozone, but when you see just one AQI, you’re looking at whatever pollutant is the higher of the two.\\n\\nYou can find the latest AQI on the EPA’s AirNow website or by downloading its AirNow app. Weather apps are often using propriety data from a company called BreezoMeter to determine AQI and forecasts. These numbers are based on EPA monitoring but may not be identical to the EPA’s AQI, though they should be in the same ballpark. Outside the US, air pollution monitoring can vary widely depending on the country, so AQIs reported around the world may also be pulling from a mix of computer modeling and satellite data.\\n\\nThere are some important drawbacks to the AQI. It tries to distill a lot of information into one datapoint, and it depends on air monitors often placed near cities and not close to industrial polluters. Since air pollution can vary widely even over short distances — think a busy highway versus a quiet, tree-lined road — the air could be worse if you’re near a pollution source. Communities of color are systematically exposed to more pollution from industrial sources and transportation, and the AQI doesn’t do a good job capturing that disparity.\\n\\nThousands of air quality monitors pull data from around the country to calculate the Air Quality Index. While the monitoring captures an accurate high-level view of pollution levels, it doesn’t capture pollution that can vary widely block to block. Hyoung Chang/Denver Post via Getty Images\\n\\nWho really needs to pay attention to the AQI?\\n\\nIdeally, everyone should monitor the AQI. EPA experts liken it to understanding the weather.\\n\\nPeople have different sensitivities to air pollutants, just as people can have different temperatures they’re comfortable at. They can even be more uncomfortable with one type of pollutant than another.\\n\\nBut the EPA breaks out its recommendations for a general population group and a sensitive population. The sensitive group is actually quite large. If you have asthma or COPD, you fall in this category, but so do young children (under age 5), older adults (over 65), and pregnant people.\\n\\n“The younger the child is, the faster their breathing, and so pound for pound, they are breathing more air pollution,” said Lisa Patel, a Stanford professor of pediatrics and an executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health. “We use 5 as a cut-off for particular vulnerabilities because age 0-5 is a period of really rapid lung growth. And so exposure to those toxins so early is particularly concerning, but it’s also concerning across the entire spectrum of ages.”\\n\\nEven if you don’t fall into one of the sensitive categories, an EPA official explained that the public should still “know their number.” The AQI is based on large population studies, so it doesn’t necessarily help you understand your individual risk. By monitoring the AQI regularly and paying close attention to any symptoms, you can get a feel for the level at which you should take proactive action.\\n\\nWhat are the six levels of air quality? And when should I be concerned?\\n\\nThe EPA breaks the Air Quality Index into a few categories with different recommendations.\\n\\nGreen (0–50): The air is safe to breathe.\\n\\nYellow (51–100): The air quality is considered moderate, except for the most sensitive groups.\\n\\nOrange (101–150): Sensitive groups should reduce heavy exertion outside or take more breaks, and people with asthma and heart disease should watch for symptoms. The rest of the population may be fine.\\n\\nRed (151–200): The air is unhealthy for everyone. Sensitive groups should avoid being active outdoors, while everyone else should reduce their time outdoors.\\n\\nPurple (201–300): The air is very unhealthy for everyone. Everyone should consider moving their activities inside.\\n\\nMaroon (301 and above): This is the highest level — hazardous — and anyone can be at risk. Everyone should avoid physical activity outdoors, and if you’re sensitive, you should remain indoors.\\n\\nDoctors and public health experts urge people to monitor any symptoms as pollution levels climb, especially once the AQI is in the orange and red range.\\n\\nThe symptoms to watch can vary. A surefire sign to take it easy (limiting activity outdoors and potentially seeking medical help) is shortness of breath. Coughing, discomfort, and tightness of the chest can all signal issues with breathing.\\n\\nOther symptoms could be less obvious, throat irritation, fatigue, a stuffy nose or a headache. An EPA expert explained she feels a side stitch when exercising on a bad air day.\\n\\nIn infants, Patel suggests to look out for grunting noises, bobbing heads, and using chest muscles to breathe as warning signs. Kids who have asthma should have an asthma action plan set with a health provider on using an inhaler.\\n\\nIt’s important to pay attention to these symptoms in both adults and children while regularly checking the AQI level at which you start to feel discomfort. Starting this now will help you in the future when you need to decide what precautions to take and when.\\n\\nWhat are the precautions I should take outdoors, and when should I take action?\\n\\nThe AQI is most confusing when it falls into the yellow, orange, and red ranges.\\n\\nIf you are sensitive to air pollution, then you want to reduce your exercise and heavy exertion outside once the AQI hits orange. The entire population should start taking precautions when it is in the red territory. You might even want to reconsider spending extensive time outside at these higher levels, and don an N95 or KN95 mask if you do need to be outside (cloth masks will not protect you from PM2.5).\\n\\nIt helps to think about reduction in terms of dosage. You can cut your time outside, your exertion level, or both. If you reduce a 30 minute walk to 15 minutes, you’re cutting your exposure to the pollution by half. If you sit on your porch instead of going for a walk or run, you’re also cutting down how much pollution you inhale.\\n\\nWhen is air pollution at its worse?\\n\\nThe time of year, and even the time of day, can matter immensely for air quality.\\n\\nOzone is typically at its worst in warmer months, between April and October in the US. It needs sunlight to trigger its chemical reactions, so late afternoons and early evenings can be smoggier than the mornings. Emissions that come from the tailpipes of cars and burning fossil fuels interact to form ozone that can build up to dangerous concentrations depending on geography and weather patterns.\\n\\nParticulate matter’s worst months are usually peak wildfire season, so late summer and fall. Again, though, there are no strict rules here. Wildfires are no longer contained to predictable seasons due largely to climate change, as the East Coast experienced when Canadian wildfires caused smoggy extremes in early June. Other sources of PM2.5 include barbecues and fireworks, making July Fourth and the days that follow worse for air quality.\\n\\nTracey Holloway, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who works with NASA, also explained that, unlike ozone, PM2.5 “comes in different flavors.” She explained, “There are some situations where PM2.5 is highest at night because it’s trapped [an inversion where the ground is cooler], and there’s some situations where PM2.5 is highest in the middle of the day because it’s cooked up by the sun.”\\n\\nThough experts focus mostly on the two main pollutants of concern in air pollution, PM2.5 and ozone, there are other substances that can hitch a ride with this pollution. Patel, the pediatrician, said wildfire smoke is especially toxic. Burning trees can release more mercury in the air because of how the pollutant has settled on surfaces. And when fires hit houses and towns, they burn up plastics and petrochemicals, releasing more carcinogenic and metallic substances into the atmosphere.\\n\\nOne tip is to not dose yourself unnecessarily with pollution when air quality is bad. A hazardous air day is a poor time to fire up the barbecue or gas stove. You could swap out the gas appliance entirely for an induction burner. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nShould I be concerned indoors?\\n\\nStaying indoors helps, but there are some additional actions to consider.\\n\\nIf you have central air conditioning or can access a building with air conditioning, that helps filter out pollutants. Also, HEPA air filters cut down on particulate matter and don’t have to cost a lot. The University of Washington has a manual for building your own low-cost air filter for roughly $20, which can dramatically lower fine particles.\\n\\nSince you’re getting a hefty dose of air pollution from the outdoors, it’s even more important not to expose yourself unnecessarily inside. Former Director of the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and pediatrician Aaron Bernstein said people do this in ways they don’t realize. They might idle their cars in attached garages, or use fragranced and ozone-forming products, or run wood- or gas-burning stoves and fireplaces that pollute indoor air.\\n\\nWhat can my community do to reduce air pollution?\\n\\nThe No. 1 action we can take for better air is addressing the root cause, not just the symptoms. After all, not everyone has control over their outdoor activities, and some communities and outdoor workers face astronomically higher risk from pollution than others. White Americans contribute more to air pollution through their consumption of goods and services, yet Black and Hispanic Americans tend to live in neighborhoods with lower air quality.\\n\\nOne of the challenges in tackling climate change is that the carbon we’re releasing now will stick around in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. That’s fortunately not the case with particulate matter and ozone. They settle in a matter of days, so air can clear almost immediately once we address the sources of pollution. The world experienced how fast the air can improve when road and air travel came to sudden standstill early in the Covid-19 pandemic.\\n\\n“A lot of air pollution comes from controllable sources,” Holloway said. “When we implement changes to our transportation, industries, energy systems, and roadways, all of those can immediately improve our air quality. Certainly, we can’t just make a policy change and have wildfires go away. But for many other sources of air pollution, there are a lot of available technologies to make the air cleaner.”\\n\\nDespite worsening wildfires, air quality has on the whole grown cleaner, especially within the United States over the last 40 years, as states have reduced major industrial sources of smog. Environmental regulations have worked as intended to clean up the worst polluters.\\n\\n“We have already made huge improvements in having cleaner vehicles and trucks, cleaner power plants, and cleaner industrial facilities,” said Holloway. “And these have been deliberate choices that we’ve made.” Holloway believes “this isn’t a hopeless situation” as long as society moves to tackling the sources of the problem.\\n\\nWhat other resources are out there?\\n\\nThis story was originally published on June 28, 2023.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'is an environmental correspondent at Vox, covering biodiversity loss and climate change. Before joining Vox, he was a senior energy reporter at Business Insider. Benji previously worked as a wildlife researcher.\\n\\nAmerica’s beloved national parks face a problem that could, in a matter of weeks, grow into a full-blown crisis.\\n\\nThe number of people visiting areas managed by the National Park Service — which includes national parks, monuments, and other sites — is way up. In 2023, the most recent year for national data, parks had more than 325 million visits. That’s about a 16 percent bump relative to 2010. At least in some parks, visitation rates have continued to rise.\\n\\nMeanwhile, staffing at the National Park Service is down, having dropped about 13 percent over that same period, according to the National Parks Conservation Association, an advocacy group. Staffing specifically in parks has fallen even further in that time, the group said, as the agency’s budget has failed to keep pace with rising personnel costs. That means there are fewer employees to oversee more visitors and mitigate their impact on our public lands and ecosystems.\\n\\nAnd this was before the recent layoff.\\n\\nLate last week, the Trump administration laid off roughly 1,000 workers in the National Park Service, or about 5 percent of its workforce, as part of a broader gutting of the federal workforce. The latest cuts targeted employees who were still in a probationary period, often meaning they were recently hired or had just moved into a new role. The layoff does not include many additional employees who opted for a deferred resignation or had offers for full-time employment rescinded.\\n\\n“In an agency that has already experienced a significant staffing decline over the past decade, these layoffs will severely affect park operations and the visitor experience,” Phil Francis, chair of the Executive Council of the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, a group representing current and former employees and volunteers of the National Park Service, said in a statement Friday. “National Park Service employees dedicate their careers to preserving our nation’s most treasured landscapes and historic sites. We should be supporting them — not jeopardizing their livelihoods.”\\n\\nThe Department of the Interior and the National Park Service did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nSend us a tip Do you have information to share about the National Park Service or other government agencies? Reach out to Benji Jones at benji.jones@vox.com, on Signal at benji.90, or at benjijones@protonmail.com.\\n\\nReporting by the Washington Post indicates the National Park Service will reinstate 5,000 seasonal job offers that were previously rescinded under a government-wide hiring freeze. That may help fill some immediate needs; seasonal employees perform a range of tasks, from collecting fees to researching wildlife. Yet it’s not clear when those jobs will be reinstated and they won’t make up for the permanent roles that have been lost, said John Garder, senior director of budget and appropriations at the National Parks Conservation Association.\\n\\n“Those seasonal employees, who are critical to serving visitors during the busy season, are no substitute for the permanent employees who manage those seasonal workers and provide the expertise and institutional knowledge and experience to ensure resource protection and a well functioning park,” Garder said.\\n\\nThe National Park Service is among the most popular US government agencies, ranking above the Postal Service and NASA for favorability, according to a 2024 poll by the Pew Research Center. Parks are also an economic engine, contributing some $56 billion to the US economy in 2023.\\n\\nCourtesy of Pew Research Center\\n\\nLeft with too few employees, parks may have to cut back hours at their visitor centers — and access to their restrooms — or cancel guided tours. Maintenance projects will be further delayed. Trash will pile up. There will be fewer educators to teach visitors about the history and biology of the region and its resources.\\n\\nProbationary workers whose roles were deemed critical to public safety, such as law enforcement officers, were exempt from the layoff. But some experts worry that the layoff will nonetheless put the public at risk, considering park workers provide basic visitor support, such as offering directions so people don’t get lost.\\n\\n“Did those who made the decision know or care that the main objective of my position is to provide preventive search and rescue education, to keep park visitors safe?” Stacy Ramsey, a worker at the Buffalo National River in Arkansas who was fired, wrote in a now-viral Facebook post. “Did they know that I am part of the visitor and resource protection division, and that I spent my days on the frontline, looking out for the safety of park visitors?”\\n\\nOver the weekend, Travis Mason-Bushman, an employee at Great Basin National Park in Nevada, wrote on LinkedIn that he lost five colleagues. “These are people who lead tours, clean toilets, answer phones, design signs, and support search and rescue operations,” he said in the post. “You cannot lay off half of any organization’s frontline staff and carry on as if nothing has happened.”\\n\\nWith fewer workers, the many ecosystems that parks conserve are also at risk from crowds of tourists, Garder said, especially during the popular months of spring and summer. These include the wet forests of Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the river and stunning views of Zion. A key part of the job of Park Service employees is to protect these resources, such as by ensuring visitors don’t litter or go off the trails.'}],\n",

One notable attack targeted Ascension, a St. Louis-based health care system with 140 hospitals in 19 states. Other victims include Hyundai Europe, UK-based outsourcing firm Capita, the Chilean Government Customs Agency, and UK utility company Southern Water.

       "   'content': 'A username and password just won\\'t cut it anymore. Users around the world logging into Gmail have often relied on Google SMS pings to securely access their accounts, but that\\'s changing. Google now hopes to move beyond SMS, which has become so frequently abused that it negates any supposed security benefit. Instead of using SMS, the company will reportedly switch to using QR codes.\\n\\nCurrently, Google sends SMS codes for two reasons: to confirm that a new login is legitimate and to block spammers from opening Gmail accounts in bulk. You type in your credentials, and a moment later, Google texts a six-digit code for you to enter as well. It\\'s not a terribly arduous process, and it can help protect your account, but SMS is not very secure.\\n\\nSMS messages are delivered by mobile carriers without encryption, and they often go through intermediaries that can be compromised without your knowledge. Even if the line is secure, phone numbers have very little in the way of security.\\n\\nSIM swap attacks are depressingly common today, with carrier reps tricked or paid off to transfer a phone number to a fraudster\\'s device. At that point, the two-factor codes from Google go right to the attacker, allowing them to log in. This same attack has been used to access crypto wallets and make off with valuable digital currency. Gaining control of the target\\'s email is often a necessary step to unlock other accounts.\\n\\nAccording to Forbes, Google plans to patch this vulnerability soon. The company will stop using SMS codes for verification, moving to a QR code that the user has to scan with their phone.\\n\\n\"Just like we want to move past passwords with the use of things like passkeys, we want to move away from sending SMS messages for authentication,\" Google spokesperson Ross Richendrfer told Forbes.\\n\\nThis dialog will soon be replaced with a QR code. This dialog will soon be replaced with a QR code.\\n\\nMoving to QR codes takes SMS out of the equation, which also means you don\\'t have to worry about your carrier\\'s security practices or lack thereof. Google also points out that QR-code scanning makes phishing scams harder. It\\'s relatively easy to trick someone into providing an SMS code. Scammers often do this by pretending to be associated with Google, but you can\\'t share what you don\\'t have.\\n\\nGoogle has not offered much in the way of specifics here. Richendrfer says the change will roll out in \"the next few months,\" but it\\'s unclear if all markets will see this change simultaneously. If you already use two-factor on your account, for example with a code generator app or a security key, you\\'ll continue using that to verify your account. We\\'ve reached out to Google and will update with anything else we learn about this impending change.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Later this week, Amazon is closing a small loophole that allowed purchasers of Kindle books to download those files to a computer and transfer them via USB. Originally intended to extend e-book access to owners of very old Kindles without Wi-Fi connectivity, the feature has also made it easier for people to download and store copies of the e-books they\\'ve bought, reducing the risk that Amazon might make changes to their text or remove them from the Kindle store entirely.\\n\\nThe \"Download & transfer via USB\" option on Amazon\\'s site is going away this Wednesday, February 26. People who want to download their libraries to their PC easily should do so within the next two days. This change only affects the ability to download these files directly to a computer from Amazon\\'s website—if you\\'ve downloaded the books beforehand, you\\'ll still be able to load them on your Kindles via USB, and you\\'ll still be able to use third-party software as well as the Send to Kindle service to get EPUB files and other books loaded onto a Kindle.\\n\\nDownloading files to your PC through Amazon\\'s site is still possible, but it\\'s going away later this week. Credit: Andrew Cunningham\\n\\nFor typical Kindle owners who buy their books via Amazon\\'s store and seamlessly download them to modern or modern-ish Kindle devices over Wi-Fi, you likely won\\'t notice any change. The effects will be noticed most by those who use third-party software like Calibre to manage a local e-book library and people who have hopped to other e-reader platforms who want to be able to download their Kindle purchases and strip them of their DRM so they can be read elsewhere.\\n\\nThe download-and-transfer option was useful for DRM haters partly because the files are delivered in the older AZW3 file format rather than the newer KFX format. AZW3 is the file format used by those older, pre-Wi-Fi Kindles, and its DRM is generally easier to remove.\\n\\nGetting your files\\n\\nIf you\\'re trying to download your Kindle purchases to your PC and Mac before the deadline, you\\'ll need to have a somewhat older Kindle or Fire device attached to your account. If you only have one of the 2024 Kindles associated with your Amazon account (the newest Paperwhite, the second-generation Scribe, or the Colorsoft), you won\\'t be offered the download option. Amazon\\'s site will also only allow you to download a single book at a time, which could take quite a while, depending on the size of your library.'},\n",

A little over an hour later, the people behind the email flood had burrowed into the nether reaches of the company's network. This is a story about how such intrusions are occurring faster than ever before and the tactics that make this speed possible.\\n\\nThe speed and precision of the attack—laid out in posts published Thursday and last month—are crucial elements for success. As awareness of ransomware attacks increases, security companies and their customers have grown savvier at detecting breach attempts and stopping them before they gain entry to sensitive data. To succeed, attackers have to move ever faster.\\n\\nBreakneck breakout\\n\\nReliaQuest, the security firm that responded to this intrusion, said it tracked a 22 percent reduction in the “breakout time” threat actors took in 2024 compared with a year earlier. In the attack at hand, the breakout time—meaning the time span from the moment of initial access to lateral movement inside the network—was just 48 minutes.\\n\\n“For defenders, breakout time is the most critical window in an attack,” ReliaQuest researcher Irene Fuentes McDonnell wrote. “Successful threat containment at this stage prevents severe consequences, such as data exfiltration, ransomware deployment, data loss, reputational damage, and financial loss. So, if attackers are moving faster, defenders must match their pace to stand a chance of stopping them.”\\n\\nThe spam barrage, it turned out, was simply a decoy. It created the opportunity for the threat actors—most likely part of a ransomware group known as Black Basta—to contact the affected employees through the Microsoft Teams collaboration platform, pose as IT help desk workers, and offer assistance in warding off the ongoing onslaught.\"},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-21T13:30:00',\n",
       "   'content': \"TP-Link is one of the most popular router manufacturers in the US, but the company is facing a potential ban due to security concerns about its links to China. A December report from The Wall Street Journal revealed that the US Commerce, Defense, and Justice Departments are investigating TP-Link, though no evidence of deliberate wrongdoing has yet emerged.\\n\\n“We are a US company,” Jeff Barney, president of TP-Link told WIRED, “We have no affiliation with TP-Link Tech, which focuses on mainland China, and we can prove our separateness.”\\n\\nThe investigation was sparked by a letter from John Moolenaar, a Republican for Michigan, and Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat of Illinois. Both are on the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party. They outlined concerns that Chinese state-sponsored hackers may be able to compromise TP-Link’s routers more easily than other brands and thereby infiltrate US systems, and that TP-Link is subject to Chinese law, meaning it can be forced to hand over sensitive US information by Chinese intelligence officials.\\n\\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\\n\\nTP-Link was founded in China in 1996 by two brothers, and TP-Link USA was established in 2008. It wasn’t until 2022 that the Chinese and US wings began to split. The process of moving the 170 subsidiaries and all the related ownership out of Hong Kong and into the United States was delayed by the pandemic, says Barney, but it was divested and restructured by 2024.\\n\\nTP-Link now has headquarters in California, a branch in Singapore, and manufactures in Vietnam. It researches, designs, develops, and manufactures everything except chipsets in-house, according to Barney. “Our entities in China are governed directly by us, our employees badged by us, secured by us, in our own facilities.” He also says TP-Link has shared documentation with investigators and that its factory in Vietnam was audited by US retail partners like Walmart, Best Buy, and Costco.\\n\\n“Everybody has a Nexus in China,” Barney says. He claims that American rival Netgear uses Chinese ODMs (original device manufacturers) to build its products and that even Apple relies on manufacturing in China. Netgear says its routers are manufactured in Taiwan, Vietnam, and Thailand, not China.\\n\\nCompetition Concerns\\n\\nThe WSJ report suggests that TP-Link has a leading 64.9 percent share of the US router market, but TP-Link disputes this. The company claims its share hovered around 20 percent for the last few years, but jumped to a 36.5 percent unit share and a 30.7 percent dollar share in 2024, according to Circana data. But even TP-Link’s lower estimate shows a company in the ascendancy. This dominance has been driven by aggressively low prices and a relatively early roll-out of Wi-Fi 7 routers, perceived by some as a concerted effort to flood the US market.\\n\\n“Technology should not be exorbitant,” Barney says. “We're trying to democratize these products.”\\n\\nHowever, the wide product range raises questions, with many wondering how TP-Link can profit from routers sold at such low prices compared to the competition. Former CNET reviewer Dong Ngo explores this point on the in-depth router review website, Dong Knows.\"},\n",

       "   'content': 'As the so-called Department of Government Efficiency continues to rampage through the United States government by making sweeping cuts to the federal workforce, numerous ongoing lawsuits allege that the group’s access to sensitive data violates the Watergate-inspired Privacy Act of 1974 and that it needs to halt its activity. Meanwhile, DOGE cut staff this week at the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and gained access to CISA’s digital systems after the agency had already frozen its eight-year-old election security initiatives late last week.\\n\\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology was also bracing this week for roughly 500 staffers to be fired, which could have serious impacts on NIST’s cybersecurity standards and software vulnerability tracking work. And cuts last week at the US Digital Service included the cybersecurity lead for the central Veterans Affairs portal, VA.gov, potentially leaving VA systems and data more vulnerable without someone in his role.\\n\\nMultiple US government departments are now considering bans on China-made TP-Link routers following recent aggressive Chinese digital espionage campaigns. (The company denies any connection to cyberattacks.) A WIRED investigation found that users of Google’s ad tech can target categories that shouldn’t be available under the company’s policies, including people with chronic diseases or those in debt. Advertisers could also target national security “decision makers” and people involved in the development of classified defense technology.\\n\\nGoogle researchers warned this week that hackers tied to Russia have been tricking Ukrainian soldiers with fake QR codes for Signal group invites that exploited a flaw to allow the attackers to spy on target messages. Signal has rolled out updates to stop exploitation. And a WIRED deep dive examines how difficult it can be for even the most connected web users to have nonconsensual intimate images and videos of themselves removed from the web.\\n\\nAnd there\\'s more. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\\n\\nRunning a cryptocurrency exchange is a risky business, as hacking victims like Mt. Gox, Bitfinex, FTX, and plenty of others can attest. But never before has a platform for buying and selling crypto lost a 10-figure dollar sum in a single heist. That new record belongs to ByBit, which on Friday revealed that thieves hacked its Ethereum-based holdings. The hackers made off with a sum that totals to $1.4 billion, according to an estimate by cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic—the largest crypto theft of all time by some measures.\\n\\nByBit CEO Ben Zhou wrote on X that the hackers had used a “musked transaction”—likely a misspelling of “masked transaction”—to trick the exchange into cryptographically signing a change in the code of the smart contract controlling a wallet holding its stockpile of Ethereum. “Please rest assured that all other cold wallets are secure,” Zhou wrote, suggesting that the exchange remained solvent. “All withdraws are NORMAL.” Zhou later added in another note on X that the exchange would be able to cover the loss, which if true suggests that no users will lose their funds.\\n\\nThe theft dwarfs other historic hacks of crypto exchanges like Mt. Gox and FTX, each of which lost sums of cryptocurrency that were worth hundreds of millions of dollars at the time the thefts were discovered. Even the stolen loot from the 2016 Bitfinex heist, which was worth close to $4.5 billion at the time the thieves were identified and the majority of the funds recovered in 2022, was only worth $72 million at the time of the theft. ByBit’s $1.4 billion is by that measure a far bigger loss and, considering that all crypto thefts in 2024 totaled to $2.2 billion, according to blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, a stunning new benchmark in crypto crime.\\n\\nThe British government earlier this month raised privacy alarms worldwide when it demanded that Apple give it access to users’ end-to-end encrypted iCloud data. That data had been protected with Apple’s Advanced Data Protection feature, which encrypts stored user information such that no one other than the user can decrypt it—not even Apple. Now Apple has caved to the UK’s pressure, disabling that end-to-end encryption feature for iCloud across the country. Even as it turned off that protection, Apple expressed its reluctance in a statement: \"Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end-encryption is more urgent than ever before,\" the company said. \"Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in future in the UK.\" Privacy advocates worldwide have argued that the move—and the UK’s push for it—will weaken the security and privacy of British citizens and leave tech companies vulnerable to similar surveillance demands from other governments around the world.\\n\\nThe only thing worse than the scourge of stalkerware apps—malware installed on phones by snooping spouses or other hands-on spies to surveil virtually all of the victim’s movements and communications—is when those apps are so badly secured that they also leak victims’ information onto the internet. Stalkerware apps Cocospy and Spyic, which appear to have been developed by someone in China and largely share the same source code, left data stolen from millions of victims exposed, thanks to a security vulnerability in both apps, according to a security researcher who discovered the flaw and shared information about it with TechCrunch. The exposed data included messages, call logs, and photos, TechCrunch found. In a karmic twist, it also included millions of email addresses of the stalkerware’s registered users, who had themselves installed the apps to spy on victims.'}],\n",

       "   'content': \"As the owner of a 3-year-old laptop, I feel the finite lifespan of lithium batteries acutely. It's still a great machine, but the cost of a battery replacement would take me a significant way down the path of upgrading to a newer, even greater machine. If only there were some way to just plug it in overnight and come back to a rejuvenated battery.\\n\\nWhile that sounds like science fiction, a team of Chinese researchers has identified a chemical that can deliver fresh lithium to well-used batteries, extending their life. Unfortunately, getting it to work requires that the battery has been constructed with this refresh in mind. Plus it hasn't been tested with the sort of lithium chemistry that is commonly used in consumer electronics.\\n\\nFinding the right chemistry\\n\\nThe degradation of battery performance is largely a matter of its key components gradually dropping out of use within the battery. Through repeated cyclings, bits of electrodes fragment and lose contact with the conductors that collect current, while lithium can end up in electrically isolated complexes. There's no obvious way to re-mobilize these lost materials, so the battery's capacity drops. Eventually, the only way to get more capacity is to recycle the internals into a completely new battery.\\n\\nThere's potentially another option: inject some new material into the battery itself. While there are physical limits to how much you can cram into the physical space inside the battery, this does have the potential to extend its useful life and get more out of the cost and energy required for manufacturing.\\n\\nBy all appearances, however, that isn't what the team behind the recent research was trying to do. Instead, most of the new paper describing the researchers' work is focused on a related problem: getting lithium into a battery during the manufacturing process. It just happens to be the case that the approach they are developing will work for both manufacturing and rejuvenation.\"},\n",

In what has quickly become a seemingly unwinnable war with tiny shards of plastic, new research suggests the antioxidants found in fruits and flowers can combat the negative effects of microplastics.\\n\\nAnthocyanins are pigments that contribute to the bright hue of certain plants. They’re abundant in berries and grapes and have been known to have several key health benefits, including reducing inflammation and improving eye health.\\n\\nVideos by VICE\\n\\nAs the new research shows, those same antioxidants “could be a promising therapeutic supplement for mitigating reproductive damage” caused by microplastics by increasing sperm count and mobility, along with other benefits.\\n\\nAnthocyanins have exhibited “potential protective effects against reproductive toxicity induced by microplastics” according to the research paper’s authors.\\n\\nThe dangerous effects of overexposure to microplastics—which are everywhere—are many. These include (but of course are not limited to) an increased likelihood of cancer, higher odds of a heart attack, and the aforementioned negative impact on the body’s reproductive system.\\n\\nIt also affects ovarian functions, but eating fruit can help with that too. The researchers say anthocyanins can benefit the ovarian tissue and provide “therapeutic” aid to the damage from microplastics.\\n\\nThis particular study tested its theory on rats. The critters were exposed to microplastics and then treated with the antioxidants. After analyzing them over a period of time, the rats showed an increase in sperm count and motility.\\n\\nThere’s still a need to test this on humans, but early reports are promising as we desperately look for ways to combat the onslaught of microplastics that are literally everywhere around us, just floating in the air. They’re also all over everyday objects like plastic takeout containers and tea bags.\\n\\nSo, yeah, we’re being exposed pretty much constantly. Hopefully, by eating plenty of fruits, nuts, and flowers, we can save ourselves from some of the damage that comes with having bodies full of microplastics.'},\n",

Diamond Shruumz had nationwide distribution, and Georgia (23) and North Carolina (17) were the states with the most reported illnesses. The FDA has feverishly been trying to identify what exactly is causing it.\\n\\nAn FDA Alert issued in June warned not to eat, sell, or serve any Diamond Shruumz brand products. It cautioned: “People who became ill after eating Diamond Shruumz-brand products reported a variety of severe symptoms including seizures, central nervous system depression (loss of consciousness, confusion, sleepiness), agitation, abnormal heart rates, hyper/hypotension, nausea, and vomiting.”\\n\\nThis week, the FDA issued an update that revealed their test results, which included finding 4-AcO-DMT, a semi-synthetic psychoactive drug similar to shrooms, and plain psilocin, a hallucinogen that produces effects similar to LSD. The FDA also pointed out that muscimol, a chemical found in some magic mushrooms, was in 9 of the 22 bars they tested. Some included the prescription drug pregabalin, used to treat seizures, and some had chemicals from the Kava plant.\\n\\nBut none of these chemicals, on their own, is known to cause the effects that Diamond Shruumz users have reported—though the FDA notes that there’s little research on combining them.\\n\\nToday, the Diamond Shruumz website has a pop-up that shares the company’s response. They’re claiming not to know what happened either:\\n\\n“At Prophet Premium Blends, we prioritize the health and safety of our consumers above all else. Recently, we have been made aware of reported incidents involving our product, Diamond Shruumz. Due to consumers becoming ill after consuming the entire chocolate bar and some products containing higher levels of Muscimol than normal, it is crucial that all of our consumers refrain from ingesting this product while we, alongside the FDA, continue our investigation as to what is the cause of the serious adverse effects.”'},\n",

With data focusing on England and Wales, she explored something called the “returning soldier effect,” which shows spikes in male birth rates following World War I and II.\\n\\nThe trend, which has also been observed in other countries, has several possible explanations.\\n\\nOne controversial theory is that healthier soldiers are more likely to survive war and come home. That, combined with the Trivers-Willard hypothesis —which posits that healthier people are more likely to conceive boys—could explain the spike.\\n\\nAnother hypothesis is that the increase in male births is nature’s way of compensating for the loss of life during the war.\\n\\nThe ‘returning soldier effect’ is just one possible explanation for birth rate trends\\n\\nFry admits that there’s no way to tell for certain what causes more male births than female, or vice versa. There are also dozens, if not hundreds, of other factors that come into play, including the health of the mothers and environmental conditions.\\n\\nFor example, writing in 2008, William H. James observed a decline in male birth rates in Iran during and following the Iran-Iraq war. He attributed the fall to “psychological stress causing pregnant women disproportionately to abort male fetuses.”\\n\\nHowever, the “returning soldier effect” definitely has a basis in fact.\\n\\n“At the end of a war, everyone has much more sex than normal,” Fry noted. “Women get pregnant slightly earlier in their cycles, and as a result, there is a spike in the number of baby boys that are born.”'},\n",

Introduction\\n\\n1.1 This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and sets out the steps which TIME, LLC, the parent company of TIME USA, LLC, TIME GP, LLC, TIME Global Holdings L.P., Time Magazine Singapore Pte. Ltd., Time Magazine UK Limited, TIME Studios Holdings, LLC, Centennial Productions, LLC, TIME Studios, LLC, Phenom Productions, LLC and Windy City Films LLC (collectively referred to in this statement as “TIME”) have taken in this financial year to combat slavery and human trafficking.\\n\\n1.2 TIME is committed to preventing slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains or any other business dealings. Taking these steps has strengthened our resolve still further and the tools it provides us with will empower us to do more than ever before in pursuit of this goal.\\n\\n2. Organization’s Structure\\n\\n2.1 TIME is a global media brand built on 100 years of unparalleled trust and authority, with an audience of more than 100 million people worldwide across our platforms. Created in 1923, TIME began as the first weekly news magazine: a digest of world events for busy people to read. Today, TIME includes a website; a magazine; a social media footprint of over 51 million; TIME Studios, an award-winning film and television division; live events; Red Border, an award-winning in-house branded content studio; TIME CO2, a climate action platform; and TIME Stamped, a recommendations and e-commerce platform created in partnership with Taboola.\\n\\n2.2 Headquartered in New York City, TIME has over 300 employees and operates globally, with employees in North America, Asia and Europe. TIME has offices in Washington D.C., London, and Singapore.\\n\\n3. Our Supply Chains\\n\\nOur immediate suppliers are as follows: those providing IT platforms that enable us to deliver our digital services and suppliers of editorial content, such as freelancers and picture agencies; those providing print magazine materials and delivery, such as printers, paper, ink, and postage; and our TIME Studios productions use local production crews. We also organize events in various parts of the world that are dependent on third party providers of venues and facilities, which also source goods and services from further down the supply chain.\\n\\n4. Our Policies on Slavery and Human Trafficking\\n\\nWe are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business. Our Anti-Discrimination, Anti-Harassment, Professional Conduct, Conflict of Interest, and Whistleblower Policies and Procedures reflect our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships. This also includes the implementation and enforcement of effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking are not taking place anywhere in our supply chains.\\n\\n5. Due Diligence Processes for Slavery and Human Trafficking\\n\\n5.1 We have put in place systems to:\\n\\n5.1.1 Identify and assess potential risk areas in our supply chains.\\n\\n5.1.2 Mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our supply chains.\\n\\n5.1.3 Monitor potential risk areas in our supply chains.\\n\\n5.2 As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk we have noted the following:\\n\\n5.2.1 Due to the nature of our activities, our suppliers are largely in low risk sectors. Most of our suppliers are based in countries which have a relatively low risk of slavery and human trafficking, such as the U.S, Canada and the E.U..\\n\\n5.2.2 However, we have identified suppliers in the food and drink / hospitality sector, which have a relatively high risk of slavery and human trafficking, particularly for events located in countries in which the risk of forced labor is greater than in the US, such as in countries in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.\\n\\n6. Supplier Adherence to Our Values\\n\\n6.1 TIME expects all suppliers and any subcontractors to respect and conform to our fundamental values as conditions for mutual business.\\n\\n6.2 We have zero tolerance to slavery and human trafficking. To ensure all those in our supply chain and contractors comply with our values we have taken the following steps:\\n\\n6.2.1 We are encouraging best practices around due diligence when selecting new suppliers.\\n\\n6.2.2 We are mitigating the risks in high risk sectors by requiring that our contracts with venues at which we hold our events in high-risk areas include written warranties and assurances regarding the venue’s implementation of appropriate systems of due diligence and actions to ensure that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking by the venue or their subcontractors.\\n\\n7. Training\\n\\n7.1 To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains and our business, we provide training to our staff.\\n\\n7.2 Staff are expected to be alert to the risks, however small, in our business and in the wider supply chain. Staff must report concerns and management are expected to act upon them.\\n\\n7.3 We have introduced a whistleblowing policy so that people can raise concerns about slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains.\\n\\n8. Further Steps\\n\\n8.1 Following a review of the effectiveness of the steps we have taken this year to ensure that here is no slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains we intend to take the following further steps to combat slavery and human trafficking:\\n\\n8.1.1 We will continue to develop and implement a plan for working with our suppliers to combat slavery and human trafficking.\\n\\n8.1.2 We will produce a code of conduct for suppliers, setting out our expectations from them with regard to slavery and human trafficking. We will make this code of conduct available to all employees on our Company intranet and will provide training on the policy.\\n\\n8.1.3 Once implemented, should a supplier fail to fulfill the minimum standards outlined in our Code, we reserve the right to terminate the business supplier or elect not to renew its contract.\\n\\n8.1.4 We will periodically review the effectiveness of the steps we have taken to ensure that there is no slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains by continuously improving any policies, procedures and systems that we have implemented.\\n\\nThis statement was approved by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Legal Officer on August 4, 2023.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"WELLINGTON, New Zealand — A decade after wellness influencer Belle Gibson admitted she didn't have terminal brain cancer, which she claimed was cured by the healthy lifestyle that made her famous, her story has inspired a new Netflix series — and fresh outrage in Australia about the case's lack of resolution.\\n\\nAuthorities said this week they're still pursuing the disgraced Instagram star for unpaid fines, fueling ongoing ire among Australians about one of the country's most brazen online scams — an episode that drew attention to the destructive harms of false health claims on social media.\\n\\nApple Cider Vinegar, Netflix's dramatic retelling of Gibson’s story released this month, doesn't recount what happened after it was revealed in 2015 that she wasn’t sick. In real life, she never faced criminal charges.\\n\\nBut in 2017, Australia’s federal court fined her 410,000 Australian dollars ($261,000), which she had raised for charity and failed to donate. The consumer watchdog in the state of Victoria is still trying to recover the funds, a spokesperson told The Associated Press.\\n\\nWhat was Belle Gibson charged with?\\n\\nGibson’s healthy recipe app, The Whole Pantry, had 200,000 downloads in one month from the Apple store in 2013. She claimed proceeds from the app and her cookbook — published by a Penguin imprint — would be donated to charities and to the family of a child with cancer.\\n\\nOnly 2% of the total was donated and Gibson was found to have breached consumer law. A court ordered her to produce the remaining funds and barred her from making health claims.\\n\\nIn a letter to the court, Gibson said she was in debt, didn’t have a job and couldn’t pay the costs.\\n\\n“Consumer Affairs Victoria has continued to undertake actions to enforce the debt owed by Annabelle Natalie Gibson (Belle Gibson) under court order,” said a statement from the agency that was supplied on Wednesday.\\n\\nThe statement did not say if any of the money has been recovered. Authorities have raided Gibson’s home twice in attempts to seize assets, but they didn’t publicly divulge an outcome.\\n\\nWhat is she saying now?\\n\\nThe AP tried to reach Gibson for comment but didn't receive a response. She hasn't spoken publicly in years and wasn't involved with, or paid by, the creators of the Netflix show.\\n\\nJacinta Allan, the premier of Victoria, said this month she was “disappointed” the case remains unresolved. But the authorities “won’t let up,” Allan told reporters.\\n\\nJournalist Richard Guilliatt, who in 2015 was the first to report that Gibson was lying, said the lack of legal consequences still fuels “vitriol” toward the erstwhile influencer.\\n\\n“The thing remains sort of like an open wound,” he said. “What she has suffered is just incredible public humiliation. There’s a part of me that thinks people are just going to have to let it go at some point.”\\n\\nDid the case prompt changes?\\n\\nGibson’s book publisher paid a $30,000 ($19,000 US) fine in the civil case for failing to fact-check her claims.\\n\\nWhile Gibson hasn't faced more charges, her case had other repercussions. Australia’s code governing therapeutic health claims was dramatically overhauled in 2022 and breaches can now be punished by millions of dollars in fines — changes some analysts attribute in part to Gibson’s conduct.\\n\\nPaid testimonials for such goods are now prohibited, and anyone claiming health expertise cannot endorse them.\\n\\n“This would have applied to the therapeutic claims that Belle made,” said Suzy Madar, a Sydney-based partner at the law firm King & Wood Mallesons.\\n\\nHow have Australians responded to the series?\\n\\nApple Cider Vinegar has drawn praise for its skewering of online wellness culture — and criticism from Australians involved in the real-life events it recounts. The series is billed as a “true-ish story, based on a lie,” and Gibson is the only real person the show purports to depict.\\n\\nBut Queensland man Col Ainscough, whose wife and daughter — also a wellness influencer — both died of cancer decried the production in a statement this month, because its characters included a family with a different name whose story appeared to parallel his own.\\n\\nThe show was “insensitive and clearly profit-driven,” Ainscough said.\\n\\n“Behind the TV stories, behind the dramatization, are real people who have had their lives devastated by the actions of this individual,” Allan, the state premier, told reporters.\\n\\nBut the case still holds fascination as one of Australia's most “bizarre and flagrant” online scams, reporter Guilliatt said.\\n\\n“I like to think that it really was a wake-up call for a lot of people,” he said. “I hope it's had an impact in terms of people's gullibility about accepting advice on very serious health conditions online.”\"},\n",

       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': \"My son Otto started preschool this fall. The previous year, during every daycare pickup, our reunion was routinely punctuated by the same questions from the other 3-year-olds in the room: Why are you in that wheelchair? What happened? How do you get in a car? I am used to questions. I’ve answered them my entire life with little fanfare. But these kinds of interactions started to feel different as soon as my son was there to bear witness to them, over and over again.\\n\\nAs we prepared for this fresh start with a new group of people, it felt like a chance to move out of autopilot and reset the terms with intention. I wanted an approach that felt better than the previous year’s, but I struggled to imagine what that might look like. What would it take to shift a dynamic that felt so innate and inevitable? Was it even possible for me to call the shots in a room full of all-consuming curiosity? And what exactly were my goals here?\\n\\nI mulled it over with anyone who would listen. Some people thought I should have a class visit where I explained my disability to the kids, maybe read a relevant book, and answered all their questions. To be fair, I am a good candidate for this kind of conversation. I started using a wheelchair when I was 6 years old, and when I discovered disability studies in my late 20s during graduate school, I understood, for the first time in my life, disability as an identity. This changed everything for me. Suddenly, I was rethinking an entire meaty part of my life that had remained relatively unexamined. I started creating what I called “mini-memoirs” on social media that brought readers into my firsthand experience of disability – the feeling of being stared at as I grip the side of my car and drag my feet across the pavement every time I fill my tank with gas, of being prayed over by strangers for my healing, of realizing as a little girl that none of the princesses looked like me.\\n\\nRead More: A Lawsuit Threatens the Disability Protections I've Known My Whole Life\\n\\nMy wheelchair became a prominent feature on my Instagram page. When I was younger, I took care to keep my disability out of photos, frequently cropping my wheelchair out of the image. On one occasion, I took out a pair of scissors and cut my legs off a print because they looked “too paralyzed.” As I took the reins on my account, I relished the chance to pull disability back into the frame – to throw more images into the world that disrupt and expand the stories and emotions so often put upon disability, to show my paralyzed legs and wheelchair existing in the middle of graduations and cute couple selfies and pregnant bellies. But also, somewhere in the soup of motivations, I started to understand the wheelchair as part of my brand – the image people recognize as they scroll. Over time, I rarely deviated from posts directly tied to disability. Even if it wasn’t at the center of the story, I made sure to connect the dots with a bold line for readers. These lines weren’t untrue, and they highlighted connections so often missed, but as a collection, they inevitably drew a portrait missing some dimension. Still, by definition, brands aren’t meant to capture every layer. They’re curated.\\n\\nWhile disability is a newer identity to be included under the banner of marginalized groups, this embodiment catapulted my writing into the public conversation in 2020. It was a time when industries and algorithms sought to amplify overlooked voices like never before. Companies started disability affinity groups, and diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) programs had funding to bring in folks who could educate on their distinct experiences. It was within this landscape that my book, Sitting Pretty: The View From My Ordinary, Resilient Disabled Body, made its way into the world. The book captures large swaths of my life, focusing the narrative through the sharp lens of disability. Five years after its publication, I still travel around the country speaking about disability, ableism, accessibility, and inclusion. It’s a dream to do this work.\\n\\nWhich might explain why I was surprised this fall when I realized I wasn’t eager to visit my son’s class to educate on disability. This is my brand, my wheelhouse, my area of expertise! What was this hesitation? And yet I found myself much more excited to talk to the kids about their pet kitties or the sparkles on their shoes than my legs or my wheelchair. I understand my difference is unavoidably visible, and it might be unfair to expect these kids to accept that difference without question, but I noticed the longing. If every other parent who entered the class was allowed to be just another human in the room, I wanted that, too. I wanted these kids, and especially my son, to see that our family embodied one splash of difference in a sea of differences.\\n\\nTo be very clear, I’m not interested in being seen as “more than my disability.” I am deeply rankled any time someone says, “Disability doesn’t define you.” Disability is not an unfortunately placed pimple I need to hide or a tragedy I need to triumph over. I claim the titles disabled mother and disabled writer joyfully. So I don’t hold up my new, complicated emotions with pride or point to them as a revelation of the “right” way to feel. I hold them up – for you and for me – as an exercise in paying attention. Can a longing help us clarify the goals? The long-haul, one-day dream?\\n\\nThis longing didn’t stay contained within the walls of my son’s classroom. About a month after the school year started, I launched a podcast with my friend Caitlin Metz. At the top of the show, Caitlin and I introduce ourselves with our identities at the forefront: “I’m Caitlin Metz, a nonbinary illustrator and designer. And I’m Rebekah Taussig, a disabled storyteller and writer.” During our weekly recordings, I’m not thinking about branding – I’m looking at my friend across a screen, giggling and aching at the impossible project of being a parent and a person. So many times, as I pull off my headphones at the end, I realize, yet again, disability had been left somewhere in the background of the discussion, even in conversations where this particular point of view would be quite relevant, like our episode “Should We Have a Second Baby?” or our interview with cartoonist Sacha Mardou, “An Ode to Therapy.” In both, I mentioned disability only in passing. It was only in retrospect that I wondered, Did I miss the mark? Should I have talked more about disability today? This doesn’t happen every week, but enough to prompt a mini crisis. What ideas are worth sharing with a public audience? Am I failing to offer the content people want from me? Am I doing a disservice to my career? Soon the angst pressed deeper than branding or career building.\\n\\nRead More: The Cruelty of Medicaid Work Requirements\\n\\nI thought back to a few weeks before Otto started at the new school when I got a call from the director. Her voice sounded a bit nervous as she explained that they were going through their building, trying to make sure everything would be easily accessible for me when they realized they didn’t always know what to look for. “You’re the expert on what you need,” she said. “Would you mind coming to campus for a quick visit so we can move through the spaces together and see if anything isn’t working for you?” This school is the third place we’ve taken Otto for childcare and the first that asked me what I need as a parent who uses a wheelchair. I started to cry. “Thank you for asking me,” I said. It was a vulnerable, brave question that exposed them to my potential criticism. What if I didn’t like them calling attention to my difference or was upset because they didn’t already know what problems needed to be fixed or what the solutions might be? But the biggest message I took from the call was that they recognized my needs would be different from the other parents’, they wanted me to experience the ease of inclusion, and they knew it was important to ask the question: What can we do to make you feel at home here?\\n\\nThe truth is, many of us with disabilities aren’t just another parent in the room, person on the plane, or citizen trying to evacuate a fire. Do we have the luxury of being seen with dimension when so many people still don’t even know what ableism means? When interabled couples are still looked at with skepticism, when we’re still fighting for inclusion in schools, housing, and workplaces, when physicians across the country still perceive disability as a direct diminishment to quality of life? When 67 people die in a plane crash and the President of the United States baselessly suggests the tragedy is a result of the FAA’s willingness to hire disabled employees? I have a microphone, a platform, that so many people don’t have. Am I squandering the power of my voice when I speak about anything else?\\n\\nI tell my podcast co-host I’m worried I’m not bringing enough disability into our conversations. I trip over my words trying to explain the competing feelings – the desire to talk freely about all kinds of things, the fears about blurring the edges of a brand that has brought good things to me and those who’ve followed along, and the very real weight of this greater responsibility to represent a group of people. Again and again, Caitlin asks, “Why do you have to choose?” Why must it be a conversation with one big, bold spotlight on disability or a conversation that ignores disability? Why isn’t there space for an organic unfurling, a messy tangle of threads that overlap and deviate? Where does this mandate come from?\\n\\nWhen my parents moved our family to Kansas City in the middle of the school year, I showed up to a new second-grade class in my hot-pink wheelchair and sat next to my mom at the front of the room. “It’s a miracle that Rebekah is alive,” she explained, filling in the details of my childhood cancer and subsequent paralysis. “But now she has to do things a little bit differently than other kids.” The students stared, looking back and forth between my mom and me. I bowed my chin, peering up every few moments. “She just wants to be treated like everyone else,” she concluded emphatically. “Now, does anyone have any questions?” The hands shot up. It’s only 30 years later, considering how I want to show up to my son’s classroom, that I notice the irony of insisting that one person “wants to be treated like everyone else” when that person is the only one with a designated time for Q&A.\\n\\nAs an adult, I’ve learned approaches to educating folks on disability that are more informed and reflective, connecting my personal experience to a larger history and social patterns. Still, I learned my job early. My body inspired a response in those who saw me – fear, heartbreak, confusion, dismissal, curiosity – and I was there to help them understand, answer their questions, shift their thinking, make them feel better, insist again and again that I was a human just like them. There was no need to grapple with what I wanted to bring to the world; it felt clear what the world wanted from me. Learning to read those cues wasn't just a neutral process. When you live in a disabled body, your care, your survival often depends on your ability to know what the people in the room – doctors, teachers, caregivers, peers – want from you. How can I ensure you’ll actually listen to me? Stick around? Advocate on my behalf? By the time I was 9 or 10, I started giving talks to auditoriums and sanctuaries full of people, providing them with a narrative of disability that could smooth out the wrinkles in their furrowed brows.\\n\\nWhat happens when that body intersects with social media? Algorithms, likes and shares, podcast analytics, downloads per episode? With this kind of data, the mandate is made even more precise. Explain, educate, alleviate, illuminate, and crush my experience into little gems of wisdom I can throw out like candy over an audience. There is a voice in my head who represents the career coach or a best-practices-for-personal-branding article shouting from the sidelines. You’re losing your audience! Focus your content! Stick to your expertise, your unique POV! Stay consistent and cohesive! Five-step plans for building brands are pulled together from clear, observable patterns. Audiences are more likely to gather when you follow these rules and more likely to drift when your content veers too far from what they’ve come to expect. I’m certain there are a host of algorithmic reasons that drive this outcome, but I’m most interested in what the pattern does to our brains as we sort out how to represent ourselves online.\\n\\nRead More: Judy Heumann Insisted Disabled People Like Me Belong\\n\\nAs I grapple with how to hold my identities – in my son’s school, online, within myself – I watch the landscape shift in front of me. It’s not a new shift, but it gains speed in a matter of months, then weeks, then days. I hear about another university, another business, then the federal government cutting DEIA programs. I learn about Texas v Becerra, a lawsuit filed by 17 states that seeks to make Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act unconstitutional. This law has protected disabled people in schools, workplaces, hospitals, and out in their communities for over 50 years. I’m under no illusion that all DEIA programs or 504 accommodations are executed perfectly. Meaningful reassessment and revision are always important to better reach the goals we set out to accomplish, but the swift toppling of these programs is not about getting better at creating a more inclusive world. The goal is to end the project.\\n\\nI understand the longing for a world where humans aren’t organized into tidy identity boxes. I’m grappling with it in my own tiny universe. There are ways we are the same, and also it’s vital we understand the ways we experience life differently. I’m weary of a world that decides my brand for me – sees my body and expects explanations, solutions, one kind of story about one kind of thing – and also we can't belong in a world where our inclusion is up for debate. It can feel almost impossible to embody both of these realities at once. We trade one for the other, erasure or spotlight – “I don’t see you as disabled” or “I follow you to learn more about disability.”\\n\\nNo one is standing over me, ordering me to choose, but brands demand focus, politics demand action, and yes, I’ve found, kids demand answers. The river moves in one direction. But where does that current take us? What parts of us get lost when our lives, stories, and selves are shaped only in reaction to the world outside of us? What stories remain untold? What happens to subtle stories? Unresolved stories? Surprising stories? Stories that hold no teaching moments or call to action but are no less real? What remains unimagined? As I look at my son and his little friends, sucking up the great wide world at alarming speed, I keep wondering about the end goal. When do we get to stop insisting that we’re whole humans and just get to be whole humans? How do we build that world while we’re still living in this one?\\n\\nRead More: My Pandemic Baby Is Pulling Us Out of Our Cozy Cave. But How Will the World See a Disabled Mother Like Me?\\n\\nThere is a little whim, a flickering spark in me that sizzles toward silliness and frivolity, wishing to blur the edges of a fixed brand and play freely in the wide open spaces of discovery. Following this impulse can feel self-indulgent to me, but I’m starting to notice something else. Unlike the never-ending work of looking out and reacting – to misconceptions, questions, injustices – the flickering whim comes from within me. No one is asking me to pay attention to it. There is no guaranteed audience if I do. But perhaps that is the power of it. Surely there is something revolutionary about a disabled woman learning the skill of listening to and protecting the glow that exists only deep in her gut.\\n\\nIn the end, I visited my son’s class as a reading buddy, which meant I was one parent among many popping in for an afternoon to read with kids one-on-one or in small groups. I brought a bunch of our favorite books and let the kids choose the one they wanted to read with me. Some of them included depictions of disability, most did not. One kid picked Caroline Cupp’s and Jessica Slice’s new book This Is How We Play, and we got to chat about learning to play checkers with their parents and building forts in our house. Two kids asked why I use a wheelchair. I answered briefly: “This is how I move through the world – how do you move through the world?” The conversations quickly turned to the cars and scooters and bikes they use to get around.\\n\\nTo be honest, this afternoon didn’t flip any sort of switch for an entirely new dynamic. It’s still not unusual for kids to ask me about my wheelchair. But showing up in this way gave me an image I keep coming back to. As we read together, one girl leaned in close, her side against my wheel, her elbow on my tire, a comfort and intimacy with a wheelchair that mirrored my own son’s. One wheelchair present, included, and integral within a larger scene unfolding in a larger context. One disabled parent figuring out how to set her own terms at a school invested in building a meaningfully inclusive community.\\n\\nAnd maybe this is a glimpse at the long-term goal I dream of – disability as a living part of a greater whole. Neither hidden in the shadows nor forced into the spotlight, but integrated into a community, accepted as one valuable part of our shared humanity. I don’t know if that world is possible, but I’m looking for windows of space – in a classroom, a podcast conversation, my own creative interiority – to just be, to just exist as fully, absurdly human, disabled and everything else. This is not a project to minimize disability or ignore the reality of this world at this time, but a sideways route to play with resetting the terms – an embodied storytelling that practices the showing alongside the telling. Because I think I need new strategies for the days ahead. It’s feeling too easy to assume that all of the teaching and naming and advocating may all be for naught. Could following the whim be part of the deep collective work of imagining a different world? I’m trying to believe it could be just around the corner.\"},\n",

       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': 'Imagine waking up one morning to find that your smartphone can no longer guide you to work, order your coffee, or connect you with friends. For many, this scenario is one of nightmares. But it’s not exactly far-fetched, either. Our reliance on comfort-driven technologies has created a fragile foundation, leaving us ill-equipped to navigate life without them.\\n\\nDespite being more digitally connected than ever, we are lonelier, more anxious, and increasingly overwhelmed. Anxiety rates surged by 25% globally due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the World Health Organization, with a Lancet Discovery Science study highlighting its lasting impact on the future burden of anxiety disorders. Depression now affects over 280 million people worldwide, underscoring the broader mental health impact of our current way of living. Burnout, once a rarity, has become nearly universal.\\n\\nAll of this can be traced to our growing dependence on digital crutches—social media, instant entertainment, algorithm-driven distractions—designed to offer quick relief but often at the expense of deep, meaningful engagement. Research suggests that heavy screen time and social media engagement are strongly linked with higher levels of social isolation, lower well-being, and increased risk of suicidal ideation. Platforms engineered to capture our attention also rewire our stress response: constant notifications, doom-scrolling, and the pressure to curate an online identity all heighten chronic stress, reduce real-world coping mechanisms, and reinforce avoidance behaviors.\\n\\nAs a result, we’ve outsourced so much of life’s effort to digital convenience that when inevitable hardships hit—whether a global crisis or a personal setback—we’re left unprepared. Instead of building resilience through direct experiences, we default to passive consumption, weakening our ability to sit with discomfort, solve problems, or navigate uncertainty.\\n\\nOn the surface, comfort seems like the antidote to stress. Why wouldn’t it be? It’s easier to order food than cook after a long day. Easier to scroll than pick up a book. Easier to follow GPS than navigate from memory. Easier to use AI than to write out an email yourself. But while these conveniences offer short-term relief, they erode the mental muscles we need to handle life’s tougher challenges.\\n\\n\\n\\nRead More: Why You Shouldn’t Let AI Write Your Emails\\n\\nTake technology. GPS has undeniably transformed how we travel, offering seamless navigation at our fingertips. But this convenience comes at a cost. A 2020 study published in Scientific Reports found that frequent GPS users struggle more with self-guided navigation, relying less on their brain’s natural wayfinding abilities. Over time, those who depended more on GPS showed a steeper decline in hippocampal-dependent spatial memory—suggesting that outsourcing navigation to technology may be weakening our internal maps. This suppression not only makes us prone to getting lost but also impairs memory and problem-solving skills, leading to broader cognitive decline. Similarly, heavy social media use—averaging between three to four hours daily for many young adults—has been linked to increased rates of depression and loneliness, as confirmed by a 2018 study in The Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology. According to American psychologist Gloria Mark’s research, constant digital distractions also contribute to a decline in attention spans, which have decreased from about 2.5 minutes to 47 seconds today, a 66% decrease over two decades.\\n\\nEven our bodies aren’t spared. Sedentary lifestyles, fueled by convenience technologies, contribute to rising rates of obesity, heart disease, and mental health challenges. Over 30% of adults worldwide are insufficiently active, according to a 2024 study published in The Lancet Global Health, exacerbating these health issues. A 2024 systematic review in Frontiers Public Health confirmed that regular physical activity isn’t just good for the body, but is also crucial for emotional resilience.\\n\\nThe problem is that the very discomfort we avoid is often what strengthens us. Just as physical muscles grow through resistance, mental resilience builds through effort. Research shows that viewing stress as a challenge rather than a threat leads to better outcomes. This \"eustress,\" or positive stress, aligns with the Yerkes-Dodson Law of Arousal and Performance, which suggests that moderate stress can enhance performance and adaptability. Neuroscience reveals that neuroplasticity—the brain’s ability to form new neural connections—is enhanced through challenging experiences. This adaptability is crucial for developing resilience. Chronic comfort, however, stifles this process, leading to a less adaptable and more fragile mind.\\n\\nNowhere is our discomfort with discomfort more evident than in our inability to tolerate boredom. It’s often dismissed as an annoyance, but research from the University of Central Lancashire found that boredom sparks creativity and problem-solving. When we resist the urge to scroll, we give our minds space to wander and innovate. This aligns with the concept of a growth mindset, as proposed by American psychologist Carol Dweck, which emphasizes that abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work, and sometimes, tolerating the boredom we experience.\\n\\nOr consider physical discomfort. A 2021 study in Nature Metabolism showed that exercise promotes the release of irisin, a hormone linked to cognitive health and stress resilience. Controlled exposure to cold or heat stress, such as cold showers or sauna use may also further enhance physiological resilience by strengthening the body’s stress response systems.\\n\\nTo be clear, the solution isn’t to reject comfort entirely; it’s to balance it with intentional discomfort. Think of it as “microdosing hardship”—a series of small, manageable challenges that keep our mental and emotional muscles strong.\\n\\nHere’s how we can start: by deliberately making life a little harder.\\n\\nWander without a destination—ditch the map and follow curiosity instead. Philosophers and creatives have long practiced flânerie, or aimlessness, as a way to unlock deep thinking and unexpected discoveries. Similarly, set aside one hour a day to do things the hard way: take the stairs, write by hand, or wash dishes manually. Small, intentional challenges train your brain to embrace effort rather than avoid it. Break free from constant comfort by micro-fasting—end showers with cold water, lowering the thermostat, or sitting in silence without distractions.\\n\\nResilience also comes from how we interact with the world. Try radical honesty—skip white lies and social niceties and say what you actually mean. Seek rejection as a practice: ask for that promotion, pitch a bold idea, or apply for something beyond your qualifications. The more rejection you face, the less fear it holds. Reignite creativity by making something useless—a haiku poem about your morning coffee, a sculpture of yourself, a short story intended for no audience. When every action isn\\'t tied to productivity, your brain finds space for innovation.\\n\\nReclaim patience and resourcefulness by cooking from scratch instead of clicking “order now.” Go a month without buying anything new—repair, barter, or borrow instead. And whenever possible, tackle the hardest task first, whether it\\'s a workout, a tough conversation, or deep work. The longer we delay discomfort, the more it controls us.\\n\\nThese small acts aren’t revolutionary—but they’re enough to reawaken the dormant resilience we’ve buried under layers of ease. Comfort, like sugar, is tempting but deceptive. It delivers an instant lift, only to leave us sluggish and unprepared in the long run. Discomfort, by contrast, is the crucible of growth, pushing us to confront uncertainty, adapt to challenges, and find meaning in effort.\\n\\nOur world isn’t getting any easier. Climate change, economic instability, and mental health crises are already testing our collective resilience. Thankfully, resilience is not a trait you are born with, but a skill that can be developed through intentional practice.\\n\\nSo, the next time you feel the pull of ease, pause. Ask yourself: Is this momentary comfort helping me grow or is it keeping me stuck? Choosing discomfort isn’t easy, but sometimes, it’s worth it.'},\n",

       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': 'In the days after giving birth, Nicole Kidman found herself unable to breastfeed. “I was so terrified, asking, What just happened? Where’s my milk?” she says. “I remember standing naked in the shower, and my sister helped me. She was my source of strength. She’d had five children—she had the wisdom to pass on.”\\n\\nKidman and I are curled up in chairs beside a fireplace inside a historic Nashville home, not far from the house the Oscar winner shares with her husband Keith Urban, their two daughters, and a serene poodle named Julian. Kidman is warm and disarmingly inquisitive: she wants to hear about my postpartum experience too.\\n\\nPerhaps I shouldn’t be surprised by the ease of this conversation about vulnerable moments in our lives as women. Kidman, 57, has emotionally exposed herself on screen for decades. On the drama Big Little Lies, she huddled under a towel between shooting scenes of domestic violence. In her latest film, Babygirl, she growled while masturbating on the floor. She marks all her scripts with notes about her characters, coded for privacy. Then she shreds them: “It’s too personal. I want it gone.”\\n\\nPhotograph by Petra Collins for TIME\\n\\nBuy your copy of the Women of the Year issue, featuring Nicole Kidman here\\n\\nFilmmakers adore her rawness. “People believe if you have power, you don’t have to go to a place of vulnerability,” says Oscar-winning director Jane Campion, Kidman’s longtime friend. “A lot of actors won’t do that because it’s uncomfortable.” For Kidman to be truly open with a director requires a leap of faith. She describes herself as trusting to a fault. “It’s how I approach all of my relationships. I’ve been hurt because of that, but I’m still not jaded,” she says. “I’m delicate, but I’m very giving. The emotions I offer are very, very real, so I need to know that if I’m giving that to you, you value it.”\\n\\nShe has found that women behind the camera often offer a support reminiscent of how her sister cared for her in those early days after childbirth. And Kidman has made it her mission to use her immense star power to shine a light on emerging directors like Halina Reijn, who helmed the bold Babygirl, about a CEO who submits to an intern in a dominant-submissive affair. Many actors called out the dearth of opportunities for female filmmakers in the #MeToo era, but few followed through on promoting talent. Kidman pledged in 2017 to work with a woman director every 18 months. She has far exceeded her promise, partnering as a producer and actor with 19 in film and TV over the past eight years.\\n\\nIn 2023, fewer than 15% of films released theatrically were directed by women. For those who do receive funding and support, Kidman says, there’s undue pressure to “be perfect” on the first outing. “It can be changed,” she says, “but it can only be changed by actually being in the films of women.”\\n\\nWith curly, strawberry-blonde hair and a preternaturally intense stare, Kidman stood out among the 14-year-olds in the Sydney-area youth acting school that a 27-year-old Campion once visited to cast her student film. Kidman won the part but dropped out, fearing she’d look silly in the stocking she had to wear on her head for the costume—now one of her biggest regrets. But the two stayed in touch, and Kidman consulted Campion after making the jump to Hollywood where, at first, her newsmaking marriage to Tom Cruise in 1990 threatened to overshadow her work.\\n\\n“By the time she was married to Tom, people in America didn’t understand Nicole had a whole career in Australia that was revered,” Campion recalls. “They just thought she was riding on his career. She was in despair about the roles she was being offered, and wondering how she could change her trajectory.” Kidman jumped at opportunities to work with directors she admired. A series of performances in the late 1990s, in Gus Van Sant’s To Die For, Campion’s The Portrait of a Lady, and Sam Mendes’ staging of The Blue Room in London, proved her bona fides.\\n\\nPetra Collins for TIME\\n\\nKidman has since worked with auteur after auteur. When certain directors call, she doesn’t even read the script before saying yes: she gleefully signed onto Lars von Trier’s 2003 avant-garde thriller Dogville; Yorgos Lanthimos’ unsettling 2017 drama The Killing of a Sacred Deer; and Robert Eggers’ bloody 2022 fable, The Northman.\\n\\nAnd, of course, Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut. Reijn has said that Babygirl was, in part, inspired by Kidman’s performance. In the 1999 movie, her character shares a sexual fantasy that triggers a crisis of masculinity for her husband, played by Cruise. Reijn fantasized about Kidman’s character carrying out the imagined affair. It’s the kind of evolution Kidman hopes to encourage by opening doors for women: “Stanley was dealing with it from the male perspective, and Halina chose to reinterpret it as a woman.”\\n\\nBabygirl, released on Christmas, capped a year of stories about women’s sexuality in midlife. Miranda July’s best seller All Fours, the Anne Hathaway romance The Idea of You, the Laura Dern movie Lonely Planet, and another Kidman project, A Family Affair, all featured women in their 40s and 50s entangled with younger lovers. “It’s always been there—it just hasn’t been told. Maybe it’s threatening,” Kidman says. But she is, as TIME’s film critic Stephanie Zacharek posited in her Babygirl review, in her “don’t give a f-ck” era. Kidman doesn’t swear, but she admits, giggling, that the sentiment resonates. “I have the philosophy to never fight anything,” she says. “Surrender.”\\n\\nShe’s come a long way from the teen who was embarrassed to wear a stocking on her head, Campion says. “That was a lesson to her later: be brave.”\\n\\nWhen we meet, Kidman has spent the previous day filming the crime series Scarpetta with Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis in Nashville and will fly to Berlin in the evening to wrap Season 2 of Nine Perfect Strangers before turning around to promote Mimi Cave’s thriller Holland at SXSW in Austin in March. Last year alone, she starred in A Family Affair, the Lulu Wang–directed Expats, Susanne Bier’s beach-set The Perfect Couple, and the CIA drama Lioness—all before Babygirl hit theaters.\\n\\nPetra Collins for TIME\\n\\nKidman is able to partner with so many female directors in part because she never stops working. “People go, ‘You’re a superwoman,’” Kidman says. “I hate it.” She doesn’t feel super—she gets fatigued like anyone else—but she’s a lifelong people pleaser. She fretted over bringing home perfect grades. If she can’t think of the exact right response to a text, she’ll ignore it for weeks. She’s often compelled to say yes to roles because doing so creates jobs. “People work when Nicole works,” Curtis says. “I’m working because Nicole is working.”\\n\\nAnd she knows it’s a privilege. She remembers times when she contemplated quitting: “When there was nothing exciting or relevant coming my way, when there was massive criticism or bullying, when your self-esteem is shattered, when you’ve been hit with some massive loss or grief and go, ‘I don’t want to get out of bed. It’s too frightening.’”\\n\\nCampion has witnessed Kidman pull herself out of moments of strife. “She’s always been a star, and that star has come up and come down, but Nicole knows that in itself is not what makes her happy. What makes her happy is her work.”\\n\\nKidman has been on a run of producing and starring in projects about privileged matriarchs whose lives unravel when a secret comes to light. It’s not that she’s particularly attracted to her glamorous yet guarded characters—those just happen to be the stories that get greenlighted. “I am so open to starting something completely a mess and shattered,” she says. “Where is it? Give me the material.”\\n\\nBut the part works. Audiences eat up her rich, icy characters. Campion, art house to the core, concedes there’s value in Kidman’s ability to tap into a hungry, predominantly female audience. “You can’t have power without being commercial,” she says. “You have to make money. Women want material that fits them, not just macho superheroes.”\\n\\nAnd there’s something deceptively progressive in those stories. Prestige roles for women often involve playing the supportive wife. But in her projects, Kidman is the star, with accomplished male actors—Alexander Skarsgard, Liev Schreiber, Antonio Banderas—bolstering her performances. When she says her onscreen husbands have been egoless, I can’t help but raise an eyebrow. “I’ve worked with some of the greatest male actors in the world, and they’ve been so generous. All of them. Is that crazy?” Kidman laughs. She wasn’t intending to flip a trope on its head. She just did it.\\n\\n—\\n\\nStyled by Stella Greenspan; hair by Italo Gregorio; make-up by Gucci Westman; production by Perfect Projects.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Dr. Frank Frizelle has operated on countless patients in his career as a colorectal surgeon. But there’s one case that stayed with him.\\n\\nIn 2014, he was treating a woman in her late 20s suffering from bowel cancer—already a rare situation, given her age. But it became even more unusual when her best friend visited her in the hospital and told Frizelle that she had many of the same symptoms as his patient. Subsequent testing revealed that his patient’s friend had a lesion that, had it not been caught early, likely would have become cancerous. “That really brought it home to me—how it’s much more common than you think,” says Frizelle, a professor of surgery at the University of Otago in New Zealand.\\n\\nStill, like any good scientist, Frizelle was skeptical. Was it simply a fluke that he kept treating strikingly young patients? Or was his practice one tiny data point in a larger trend?\\n\\nHe found his answer after sifting through national health data: colorectal cancer, he discovered, was indeed being diagnosed more often than in previous years among New Zealanders under 50. Further research by Frizelle analyzing populations in Sweden and Scotland showed the same thing. A bigger picture was emerging. Here were three different countries, with different populations and health challenges—but united by a spike in colorectal cancers among young adults.\\n\\nPhotograph by Frankie Alduino for TIME\\n\\nIn the years since, it’s become clear that the problem isn’t limited to those three countries, nor to colorectal cancer. Researchers have found that young people around the world are getting many different kinds of cancer at alarmingly high rates. And as the diagnoses of celebrities and public figures like Kate Middleton, Chadwick Boseman, Dwyane Wade, and Olivia Munn bring mass attention to the issue, scientists are racing to answer a question on the minds of many outside the medical profession: Why is cancer, historically a disease of old age, increasingly striking people in the primes of their lives?\\n\\nGlobally, diagnoses and deaths related to early-onset cancers—those affecting patients younger than 50—rose by 79% and 28%, respectively, from 1990 to 2019, according to a recent study published in the medical journal BMJ Oncology. In the U.S., breast cancer is the most common type of early-onset disease, but recent surges in cancers affecting digestive organs—including the colon, rectum, pancreas, and stomach—are particularly dramatic within this age group. In fact, today’s young adults are about twice as likely to be diagnosed with colon cancer—and four times as likely to be diagnosed with rectal cancer—as those born around 1950, research suggests.\\n\\nRead More: The Unique Hell of Getting Cancer as a Young Adult\\n\\nOverall, cancer is still overwhelmingly an older person’s disease. As of 2025, 88% of people in the U.S. diagnosed with cancer were 50 or older, and 59% were 65 or older, according to data from the American Cancer Society. But there is no question that the demographics are shifting. Under 50s are not only at increasing risk of suffering from cancer; theirs is the only age group for which the risk is rising. All told, 17 types of cancer are on the rise among U.S. adults in this age group.\\n\\n“When we were younger, we assumed the climate would be the same forever. The same applies in cancer,” says Dr. Thomas Powles, a U.K.-based oncologist and cancer researcher who edits the journal Annals of Oncology. “We just assumed that cancer incidence was something that is relatively static. But it’s not.”\\n\\nThere is some good news in the data. Advances in disease detection and treatment, as well as dramatic declines in smoking, mean that far fewer people die from cancer now than once did. Although the disease still ranks as the second most common cause of death in the U.S., killing more than half a million people each year, mortality rates have dropped by about a third since 1991.\\n\\nLess encouragingly, the rate of new cancers diagnosed has remained stubbornly consistent, declining only modestly from 1999 to 2021. Across the U.S., roughly 2 million new cancer cases are detected each year, diagnoses that, on top of the emotional toll, force patients to cumulatively fork out billions of dollars in out-of-pocket costs—more than $16 billion in 2019 alone, according to federal data. Today, about 40 out of every 100 U.S. adults can expect to be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetimes. For an estimated 1 in 17 U.S. women and 1 in 29 U.S. men, that news will come before their 50th birthdays.\\n\\nThe rise in early-onset diagnoses partly comes down to advances in our ability to detect and diagnose different kinds of cancers. “With much more sophisticated tools now, inevitably we’re doing more tests on younger people [and] we’re using more accurate imaging,” which leads to more cancers detected, Powles says. Some screening protocols have also been modified in recent years to include younger adults; since 2018, for example, the American Cancer Society has recommended colonoscopies starting at age 45, down from 50.\\n\\nRead More: Some Early Forms of Breast Cancer May Not Need Treatment, Study Says\\n\\nBut this is only one part of what scientists say is a more complex web of factors they are still attempting to understand. The data suggest that some element—or perhaps combination of elements—of modern life is sickening progressively younger adults. And right now, no one knows for sure what that is.\\n\\nThere are plenty of known risk factors for cancer, from the genes someone is born with to the unhealthy lifestyle habits they pick up, such as smoking, drinking lots of alcohol, or spending time in the sun. Such habits can speed up the natural degradation of cells, which over time acquire genetic mutations as they lose their ability to repair damage. As that damage accumulates with age, cells may become cancerous, growing and -multiplying too fast for the body’s immune system to keep them in check and potentially choking out vital organs. The immune system also loses some of its strength with age, making it easier for cancer cells to colonize the body.\\n\\nBut classic risk factors do not seem to fully explain the recent rise in early-onset cancers, says Dr. Cathy Eng, director of the Young Adult Cancers Program at Vanderbilt University’s Ingram Cancer Center in Tennessee. Some of the trends are baffling; young, nonsmoking women, for example, are being diagnosed with lung cancer in strangely high numbers. Many times, Eng’s patients were extremely healthy: vegetarians, marathon runners, avid swimmers. “That’s why I really believe there’s other risk factors to account for this,” she says.\\n\\nKelly Spill, 33, was initially brushed aside by doctors who thought her cancer symptoms were related to pregnancy and birth. “If you don’t find your answers, keep pushing for them,” Spill says. Frankie Alduino for TIME\\n\\nThere’s no shortage of theories about what those may be. Many scientists point to modern diets, which tend to be heavy on potentially carcinogenic products—including ultra-processed foods, red meat, and alcohol—and may also contribute to weight gain, another cancer risk factor. The foods we eat can also affect the gut microbiome, the colony of microbes that lives in the digestive system and appears linked to overall health. Alterations to the gut microbiome via diet, or perhaps exposure to drugs like antibiotics, have also been implicated.\\n\\nOther researchers blame the microplastics littering our environment and leaching into our food and water supplies, some of which, according to a 2024 study, have even shown up in cancer patients’ tumors. Other environmental factors could also be to blame, given that everything from cosmetics to food packaging contains substances that many researchers aren’t convinced are safe. Even our near constant exposure to artificial light could be messing with normal biological rhythms in ways that have profound health consequences, some research suggests.\\n\\nFor now, these are all just hypotheses. Some may turn out to be wrong, and more theories will emerge in time. It’s also likely that different risk factors are linked to different cancers, Frizelle says. Even in a single patient, multiple overlapping triggers may be in play.\\n\\nFrizelle’s research on colorectal cancer, for example, suggests there may be a dysfunctional relationship between microplastics, certain foods, and some types of gut bacteria. Studies suggest that when microplastics get into the body, they can penetrate the mucous lining that protects the bowels and carry bacteria and toxins to the bowel lining. This leaves the bowel more susceptible to damage from pathogens inside the body—including strains of gut bacteria that are known to become more virulent when they interact with compounds found in red and processed meat. In some patients, this perfect storm of invaders may result in cancer, Frizelle thinks.\\n\\nRead More: CNN’s Sara Sidner Is Demystifying Breast Cancer Treatment\\n\\nHe believes this overlapping puzzle of risk factors is a likelier explanation than any one lifestyle habit driving a dramatic uptick in cancers—especially since younger generations are, in many respects, healthier than their ancestors. In the U.S., for example, tobacco use has plummeted in recent decades, and young adults are increasingly unlikely to drink. “How is the health-conscious generation getting more bowel cancer?” Frizelle asks.\\n\\nDr. Andrea Cercek, co-director of the Center for Young Onset Colorectal and Gastrointestinal Cancers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, agrees that some early-onset cancer cases defy easy explanation. She’s treated patients in their 20s and even teens with tumors that, biologically, “look just like a regular 80-year-old’s tumor.” These cases stump her. “Even if they drank as a teenager, it just doesn’t make sense,” she says. A few years of drinking alcohol, following an unhealthy diet, or having obesity should not be enough to produce the kind of tumor typically seen in a senior citizen, Cercek says. And yet, there they are.\\n\\nGiancarlo Oviedo-Mori, 32, credits his Christian faith with helping him live with lung cancer for more than a decade. “When I was first diagnosed, I was searching on Google for anybody who was a survivor, and I couldn’t find no one,” he says. “There is hope. There are people who are living long and having a great quality of life.” Frankie Alduino for TIME\\n\\nTo Cercek, these advanced tumors suggest that people have been exposed to damaging substances for a long time, perhaps even longer than they were aware of. Research and awareness about early-onset cancer is accumulating now, but the source of the problem may not be new, Cercek says. It can take years for even the most toxic exposures to result in health problems—which means that the source of a problem in the public eye now may have emerged decades ago, silently sickening people until the trend became too pronounced to ignore.\\n\\nGiancarlo Oviedo-Mori, 32, is one of many patients whose cancer defies obvious explanation. When he was in high school, Oviedo-Mori developed a persistent cough that didn’t respond to medication. Eventually, at just 18 years old, he was diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer.\\n\\nOviedo-Mori and his doctors were stunned. He’d had asthma as a child growing up in Peru, but he had no family history of cancer and had never been a drinker or smoker; he was barely even old enough to buy cigarettes and still years shy of his 21st birthday. Oviedo-Mori’s family spent a day observing the site of the 9/11 terrorist attack when toxic particles were still in the air, but it had been a brief visit and no one else in the family had developed health problems. That was the only exposure he could think of. The diagnosis didn’t make sense. “It was so weird,” he says.\\n\\nRead More: 4 Important Steps to Take After a Cancer Diagnosis\\n\\nAs he went through cancer treatment—including chemotherapy, radiation, and a surgery that removed his entire left lung—he’d look at his fellow patients, and, seeing how much older they were, feel out of place. “I didn’t belong there,” he says.\\n\\nMore than a decade later, Oviedo-Mori is still in treatment, participating in a clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering (where all the patients pictured in this article have received care) in hopes of ridding his body of cancer for good. But, though he’s still fighting cancer, he is in good health—he can even play soccer, despite having only one lung, and chase after his almost 2-year-old son. “Sometimes, I don’t believe it,” he says. “I think about [my son] and I’m like, ‘Oh my gosh, you’re really a miracle.’”\\n\\nFiguring out how young people like Oviedo-Mori fall prey to cancer is not easy, given the sheer number of potential health hazards in the modern world. It is a puzzle with an unknown number of pieces—one that Dr. Shuji Ogino, a pathologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, is trying to solve with a technique he pioneered.\\n\\nDr. Shuji Ogino, a pathologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, is studying early-onset cancer using a unique approach that combines epidemiology (the study of population-level health trends) and molecular pathology (the granular analysis of a patient’s tumor). He believes this unlikely pairing will help uncover triggers for early-onset disease. Sophie Park for TIME\\n\\nOgino and his team are making their way through about 4,000 colorectal tumor samples that came from people who developed the disease at various points in their lives. Each sliver of tissue holds innumerable clues about the person it belonged to, from what they ate and drank to the bacteria that lived in their body before cancer took root. To unearth these clues, the researchers stain the tissues, so that under the lens of a powerful microscope, they can see the different types of cells in the tumor in brilliant color. Using these cell-level insights, they can distinguish between the tumors of young vs. older patients and—with the help of AI—search reams of scientific literature for environmental exposures, lifestyle habits, or health conditions linked to particular cellular traits. Repeating this painstaking detective work enough times helps reveal patterns among young cancer patients, giving Ogino and his team clues as to what may have caused their diseases.\\n\\nTheir research has already pointed to some possible answers for early-onset colorectal cancer. The big three so far are eating a typical Western diet (high in sugar, processed foods, and red meat, low in fresh produce), developing insulin resistance (a precursor to diabetes also linked to poor diet), and having a particular type of E. coli bacteria in the gut. Nothing is proven yet, Ogino says. But since there’s no harm in eating healthfully, he believes dietary changes are worth making now.\\n\\nOgino personally drinks very little and eats a healthy diet. He makes sure his young son eats well too, since his research makes him acutely aware of the importance of developing healthy habits starting from a very young age. But even for children as young as Ogino’s son, some damage may already be done—at least according to Dr. George Barreto, a surgeon and cancer researcher at Flinders University in South Australia.\\n\\nRead More: 8 Symptoms Doctors Often Dismiss As Anxiety\\n\\nBarreto—who started researching early-onset cancer after not just his patients, but also several of his relatives and friends, were diagnosed at young ages—has theorized that damage may start in the womb. It’s well established that the pre-natal period can have long-term effects on a baby’s health, and Barreto believes that phenomenon may extend to cancer risk if parents are exposed to carcinogens during this critical developmental time. This theory could help explain mysterious cases like those Cercek describes, involving patients who seemingly haven’t lived long enough for even their riskiest habits to catch up with them.\\n\\nProving his theory won’t be simple, Barreto acknowledges. It would require collecting data on huge numbers of people, starting before they were even born, then sifting through that data to pinpoint relevant prenatal and early-life triggers. To speed up the process, Barreto has contacted more than 20 research groups around the world that are tracking groups of people beginning at or before birth, in hopes of using their data to jump-start his research. “If we start [from scratch] now, it will take us 40 years to find answers,” Barreto says. That’s too long to wait, with patients already getting sick at an alarming rate.\\n\\nThere is yet another question for researchers to answer: whether, on a molecular level, young patients’ cancers are dramatically different from those that occur in older people. If so, these findings may guide researchers toward new treatment approaches.\\n\\nSome research, including by Eng, has pointed to molecular differences, at least among patients with early-onset colorectal disease. But other scientists are less convinced. Powles, the U.K. oncologist, says he hasn’t seen strong evidence to suggest that early-onset cancers are much different or more aggressive than later-in-life cancers; they just happen to strike patients at younger ages.\\n\\nCarrie Regan, 41, went to the ER in 2023 because of stomach pain, which led to an ovarian cancer diagnosis. Regan is now in good health and is monitored for recurrence. She wants other women to be vigilant about their health, since ovarian cancer symptoms, like bloating and cramps, are easy to miss. “The day I went to the ER, there was a long wait and I started to feel better. I almost left,” she says. The fact that she didn’t saved her life. Frankie Alduino for TIME\\n\\nEven if there is no medical requirement to stray from classic treatment methods—like chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery—younger patients have unique needs. Standard treatments, while often effective, can be destructive for people with decades of life ahead of them, potentially leading to life-altering physical changes, like permanently needing a colostomy bag or enduring early menopause and infertility. “The worst thing [for an oncologist to hear] is, ‘I’m cured and my cancer’s gone, but I wish that I’d just lived with my cancer because living like this isn’t living,’” Cercek says.\\n\\nKelly Spill was blindsided when she was diagnosed with Stage III colorectal cancer in 2020. She was only 28, had no family history of colorectal cancer, and had recently given birth to her first child. She was even more stunned when she learned that her treatment would force her to permanently use a colostomy bag and leave her unable to carry more children. “That completely broke me,” she says. “I’d always wanted a big family.”\\n\\nJust before she was set to start chemotherapy, however, a research nurse told her she might be a fit for an experimental trial that Cercek was leading. Cercek was testing a new approach among patients whose tumors had a specific genetic mutation: using intravenous medication to boost their immune systems’ abilities to recognize and attack cancerous cells, ideally sparing patients from chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.\\n\\nRead More: What to Do If Your Doctor Doesn’t Take Your Symptoms Seriously\\n\\nDespite all the unknowns that came with participating in a clinical trial, Spill says it was a “no-brainer” to try Cercek’s approach instead of therapies that would leave her with lifelong physical side effects. Her gamble paid off: by her ninth treatment session, her tumor had entirely disappeared. Spill is still cancer-free and expecting her third baby in May.\\n\\nIn June, Cercek reported that out of 41 rectal cancer patients who completed the full regimen, 100% were cancer-free and required no additional treatment. She is now also studying the method against a variety of different cancers, ranging from stomach to bladder. A patient of any age could benefit from this approach, Cercek says, but it could be particularly impactful for young patients, like Spill, who are desperate to avoid permanent side effects.\\n\\nEven without novel medical approaches, cancer centers are beginning to recognize that, compared with elderly patients, “adolescents and young adults have very different experiences, and therefore need very different approaches to their treatment,” says Alison Silberman, CEO of Stupid Cancer, a nonprofit that supports young people with the disease. Physical fallout isn’t the only hurdle to overcome, Silberman says. Compared with older patients, young people are more likely to struggle to pay for their care and to develop mental-health issues as a result of it.\\n\\nSilberman witnessed these challenges when her brother was diagnosed with advanced cancer in his 20s. “He was yanked out of his life,” forced to leave his job and apartment to move back in with their parents, Silberman remembers. Cancer made him grapple with his own mortality, largely on his own. “He was too old to be a pediatric patient, too young to be an adult patient,” she says. “That was very isolating for him.”\\n\\nImtiaz Hussain, 31, says cancer is seen as “kind of untreatable” in his native Pakistan. He no longer thinks so, after joining a clinical trial run by Memorial Sloan Kettering’s Dr. Andrea Cercek. After just a few months of treatment with an experimental immunotherapy drug, Hussain felt better. Today, he is cancer-free and a father of three. “I was a part of history,” he says. Frankie Alduino for TIME\\n\\n“Care of early-onset cancer patients becomes complex even beyond [medicine],” says Dr. Veda Giri, an oncologist and co-director of Yale Cancer Center’s Early Onset Cancer Program in Connecticut. This spring, the program will launch new services meant to address that very problem. Patients in the program will be contacted by coordinators who can help guide them through issues that commonly affect young-adult patients, from ways to preserve fertility to deciding whether to pursue genetic testing or enroll in a clinical trial. Patients can also participate in support groups with others in their age group, in hopes of improving social and mental health. The goal: to “support patients and their families from diagnosis all the way through their cancer journey and beyond into survivorship,” since young adults cured of cancer may have continuing needs for decades to come, Giri says.\\n\\nThe ultimate goal, of course—and the ultimate win for doctors and researchers working in this field—will be for early-onset cancer centers to be rendered unnecessary. But it likely won’t happen anytime soon. Proponents of sophisticated new artificial-intelligence technologies have raised expectations, promising new tools that could transform cancer research. AI gives scientists the ability to sift through mountains of data with hitherto unimaginable levels of precision. And the hope is that these tools will unlock a cascade of new discoveries—illuminating unrecognized risk factors, for example, and turbocharging the development of new treatments.\\n\\nBut cancer researchers remain cautious. There is hope, no doubt—but like the legions of scientists grappling with complex medical puzzles in other fields, they are wary of overstating the pace of progress and raising the hopes of patients, even with new technologies at their disposal.\\n\\n“It will be impossible to design a clinical trial that can test all different possible causes of early-onset cancer,” says Dr. Andrew Chan, director of cancer epidemiology at Mass General Cancer Center. AI and other technologies may help land on those possible causes faster. But to really understand exactly what’s driving the disease and how to stop it, researchers must work slowly and methodically, studying various potential triggers—from diet to alcohol to microplastics—one by one.\\n\\nRead More: 8 Ways to Shorten Your Wait for a Doctor’s Appointment\\n\\nChan’s team is starting with a trial that will study whether losing weight with the help of GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound affects future cancer risk among people who have survived early-onset cancer and who are overweight. Future research may study the effects of specific dietary changes, he says. But not all potential cancer triggers are as straightforward to modify as weight and diet.\\n\\nTake microplastics, which Frizelle, the New Zealand surgeon, believes are contributing to early-onset cancer. Frizelle is realistic about their ubiquity. Avoiding them is all but impossible in a world where water supplies are tainted and babies suckle on plastic bottles from their earliest days on earth. Barreto’s research on cancer risk starting in the womb paints an even bleaker picture, suggesting that the deck may be stacked against some people before they are really people at all. (He chooses to see it more optimistically, noting that everyone can still “take the power into their own hands” by avoiding known carcinogens.)\\n\\nThe upshot of all this: it could take years, if not decades, to sort out what’s causing early diagnoses, and perhaps even more time to figure out how to stop them. What seems so obvious to us now—the conclusion that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer, for example—took some 40 years for scientists to solidify. Even once they did, change didn’t happen overnight. Smoking rates have fallen steadily since public-health warnings escalated in the 1960s, but they didn’t plummet all at once. Still, change is possible. Today, smoking is at historic lows, and lung cancer diagnoses have declined with them.\\n\\nIf the challenge sounds daunting, for researchers like Ogino, from Brigham and Women’s, the complexities are part of the process. He is reminded every day that good science takes as long as it takes. Many of the tumor samples he relies on in his research came from participants enrolled in a study that launched in 1976. The researchers who started it couldn’t have known that, 50 years later, their work would be critical in the quest to reverse the rise of early-onset cancer, Ogino says.\\n\\n“That’s the kind of legacy you can make in science,” he says. “That’s a great, rewarding way to contribute”—even if it takes a lot of time to get there.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Why your most attractive qualities can give your partner \\'the ick\\'\\n\\n1 day ago Will Park\\n\\nJavier Hirschfeld/ Getty Images (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld/ Getty Images)\\n\\nThe qualities that make us stand out the most, and the main reasons that people find us attractive, can be a blessing and a curse. Sometimes our most appealing traits can become a reason for a breakup.\\n\\n\"The ick\" was one of the more unusual words to be added to the Cambridge Dictionary in 2024. The phrase describes the feeling of suddenly seeing something about a partner in a new light, and finding it so unattractive it can\\'t be unseen. Once you have the ick, it is unfortunately incurable.\\n\\nWhile the phrase might be intended in a lighthearted manner, it shows that there can be unattractive qualities about a partner that are not immediately obvious. In fact, we might have found those qualities really attractive earlier in the relationship. This is called \"fatal attraction\" – when a person comes to dislike aspects of a partner that they were initially attracted to. \"It doesn\\'t mean fatal in the sense of deadly, but fatal as in the sense of prophetic,\" says Diane Felmlee, a social psychologist from Penn State University in the US.\\n\\n\"I like to think of it as having \\'too much\\' of an attractive quality,\" she says. \"Disenchantment with a partner can occur even when people get what they want, and perhaps because they get what they want.\"\\n\\nDuring her own research, Felmlee asks people for reasons they were first attracted to a partner, why they became dissatisfied and why past relationships ended. Most people listed various needs that were not being met by their ex-partner as a cause for a breakup. But Felmlee noticed some of those missed needs were related to reasons they were attracted to an ex-partner in the first place.\\n\\n\"It is a different interpretation of the same quality,\" she says. \"It\\'s a negative way of looking at a positive trait. I have an example here of someone who said they were attracted to their partner because she was considerate. And then they complained that she said \\'sorry\\' too much. Well, that sounds pretty considerate.\"\\n\\nOther examples identified by Felmlee include being attracted to someone with a high-powered job, only to find that they spend too long at work, or finding a partner funny, but then complaining that they don\\'t take life seriously. Easygoing, laid-back partners became flaky or never on time. \"Easygoing is great, as long as you\\'re punctual,\" says Felmlee with a laugh.\\n\\nLikewise, partners who are at first judged to be powerful or strong become controlling or overbearing after a breakup. People who are nice become pushovers. Successful people become workaholics.\\n\\nDisenchantment with a partner can occur even when people get what they want, and perhaps because they get what they want – Diane Felmlee\\n\\nWith fatal attraction, the stronger the initial attraction to a particular characteristic, the more likely it is to become a reason for a breakup. Why might it be that big positives end up being dealbreakers?\\n\\nFirst, it could be that the things we first notice about new partners, or potential partners, are the extreme qualities that make them stand out. \"We don\\'t describe partners as \\'kind of helpful\\', or \\'a little hard working\\',\" says Felmlee. \"And the more extreme it is, the more likely people are to dislike those qualities later.\"\\n\\nThere might be an element of naivety too, adds Felmlee – our initial infatuation temporarily blinds us to the potential downsides of a very extreme characteristic. But after the initial excitement subsides, we become more aware of how those characteristics might have a negative effect.\\n\\nThis reevaluation can happen subtly over time. Fatal attraction might be a slow, dawning realisation rather than a drastic reversal in judgment as with the ick. Couples that have been together for between 10 and 21 years have the lowest levels of relationship adjustment, meaning that they find it harder between these ages to resolve conflicts, adjust to new challenges or change their expectations towards their partner.\\n\\nJavier Hirschfeld/ Getty Images Someone who enjoys organising surprises can also become frustratingly difficult to plan anything with (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld/ Getty Images)\\n\\nIt is important to reevaluate relationship satisfaction because it is a predictor for many aspects of life, according to Samantha Joel, a psychologist at Western University in Ontario, Canada. People in unhappy relationships have poorer physical health, higher blood pressure, are at higher risk of poor mental health and have worse work-life balance, among many other problems.\\n\\nA simple measure of relationship satisfaction, called social exchange theory, can be made by comparing the rewards we receive from being with a partner, such as how much fun we have, if they make us feel prized, their beauty or money, against the costs, such as conflicts, the potential to be hurt or financial investments. There are two ways that people use social exchange theory – firstly by comparing a current relationship to past ones. We will find a relationship less satisfying if it falls below the standard that we expect based on past experiences. The other comparison we might make is with other options available to us currently. We might reject potential partners, even if we think the signs may be promising, if we feel we might have better odds with other people.\\n\\nThose calculations will be different for everyone. Same-sex couples, for example, are likely to face higher relationship costs because of discrimination and homophobia. Depending on where you live, you might have fewer dating options available to you too.\\n\\nIt is probably a better bet to look for someone with similar extremes to us rather than average qualities – Diane Felmlee\\n\\nSo, are we better off being drawn to a middle-of-the-road partner with fewer extremes? \"I don\\'t think so,\" says Felmlee. \"It is probably a better bet to look for someone with similar extremes to us rather than average qualities.\"\\n\\nCouples that are similar in some key traits are more likely to be successful. Looking at a pool of 79,000 British couples, the strongest indicator for relationship satisfaction is being a similar age. But other demographic factors, including education, and some other things like religious or political beliefs and substance use are also strong predictors for relationship success. There are also smaller but still significant correlations between biological factors like being a similar height and BMI.\\n\\n\"We found particularly high correlations for things like beliefs and values, educational attainment, and certainly substance use,\" says Tanya Horwitz, a doctoral student at the University of Colorado Boulder in the US. Similarity seems to be strengthening, but dissimilarity only seems to be a problem in certain circumstances. \"A smaller minority showed any sign of a negative correlation,\" she says. One example which did seem to matter was that morning people really don\\'t seem to be compatible with evening people, and vice versa.\\n\\nJavier Hirschfeld/ Getty Images Despite the difficulties it can cause, fatal attraction doesn\\'t necessarily mean the end of a relationship (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld/ Getty Images)\\n\\nHorwitz says that two very different people might still find themselves attracted to each other initially, but they are less likely to be successful long-term. The couples in her study were older, cohabiting, married or co-parenting. \"These were generally people who are in quite serious or long-term relationships, and I think it really says more about what makes for a long-term union, than what makes for an initial attraction,\" she says.\\n\\nFelmlee caveats that fatal attraction doesn\\'t have to be terminal for a relationship. Partners who share similarly strong characteristics might do OK. \"Studying fatal attraction, it\\'s less common for people to complain about the similar qualities that they say they have in themselves,\" she says.\\n\\nOne of her interviewees, an older man, said he was first attracted to his wife because of the strength of her character and her confidence. The downside, he said, is that she could sometimes be stubborn. \"But they\\'re still married,\" says Felmlee. \"So what\\'s going on? He also showed an awareness of himself and admitted he could be stubborn too. That was really sweet.\"\\n\\n--\\n\\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can\\'t-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.'},\n",

       "   'content': '\\'It stirred the people to breathless wonder and scalding abuse\\': The tumultuous history of the Sydney Opera House\\n\\n8 hours ago Myles Burke\\n\\nSydney Opera House (Getty Images)\\n\\nThe building of the Sydney Opera House began on 2 March 1959. But when BBC Tonight visited the construction site in 1965, it was plagued by technical problems, soaring costs, vacillating public opinion and political infighting.\\n\\nIn 1965, BBC reporter Trevor Philpott sat overlooking Sydney Harbour as he tried to find the right metaphor to describe the vibrant, arching structures of Jørn Utzon\\'s roof design for the Australian city\\'s Opera House. \"It was a score of towering shells. It was a cluster of seagulls spreading concrete wings. It was a huddle of sailing boats with billowing concrete sails,\" said Philpott. He then added the caveat: \"And it was an unmitigated bitch to build.\"\\n\\nThe fraught saga of the Sydney Opera House\\'s construction began on 2 March 1959, 66 years ago this week. Six years after that, when BBC Tonight\\'s Philpott went to see the building\\'s progress, it was already years behind schedule, mired in spiralling costs, changing designs and escalating political tensions. To say it was having a difficult birth would be an understatement.\\n\\nWATCH: \\'It was called \\'The Sydney Harbour Monster\\'.\\n\\nThe idea to build an opera house for the city had been proposed in the late 1940s by an acclaimed English conductor, Sir Eugene Goossens. At the time, Goossens was something of a celebrity in the classical music world, having carved out a successful career in the UK and the US. After World War Two, he had been lured to Sydney to become the director of the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music with the promise of a salary greater than that of the Australian Prime Minister, musicologist Dr Drew Crawford told the BBC podcast A Very Australian Scandal in 2023.\\n\\nThe creation of a new, world-class music performance venue was the conductor\\'s passion project. He had spied from his office window what he believed was the ideal site for it – the tram depot at Bennelong Point. Known to the local indigenous Gadigal people of the Eora nation as Tubowgule, it was a place where Aboriginal celebrations had been held for thousands of years. Throughout the 1950s, Goossens lobbied hard, trying to turn his dream into a reality. \"There were very few other people who could have that vision, articulate that vision, and have the ear of the Premier [of New South Wales], have the ear of the Prime Minister, be able to talk to people to get it going,\" said Dr Crawford.\\n\\nIt was called the Sydney Harbour monster, a piece of Danish pastry, a disintegrating circus tent – Trevor Philpott\\n\\nGoossens convinced the Premier of New South Wales, Joseph Cahill, that an opera house would reshape the world\\'s view of Australia, that he had found the perfect site for it, and that they should launch \"a grand competition, open to the architects of all the world, to decide exactly what manner of a building they should put there\", said Philpott. \"They made only one condition, that nothing quite so remarkable should have been ever built before.\"\\n\\nGoossens himself would not get to see his ambition realised. In 1956, having just picked up his knighthood in the UK, he was detained upon his entry back into Australia, where his bags were searched and found to contain, among other things, smuggled pornography, compromising photographs and rubber masks. The resulting scandal, which involved affairs, erotica and witchcraft, completely scuppered the conductor\\'s career in Sydney. He fled the country for Rome, traveling under the alias of Mr E Gray, never to return.\\n\\nGetty Images The opera house was originally scheduled to open in January 1963 – but in fact the building wasn\\'t completed until 1973 (Credit: Getty Images)\\n\\nHowever, the design competition went ahead as planned, with a panel of judges evaluating some 233 submitted entries. At the start 1957, the government announced that a largely unknown Danish architect, Utzon, was the unexpected winner. Part of the surprise at Utzon\\'s success was that his entry had largely consisted of preliminary sketches and concept drawings. \"As far as building anything of any scale, he hadn\\'t really done very much,\" Sir Jack Zunz, who worked on the project for the civil engineering firm Arup, told BBC Witness History in 2018.\\n\\nAn optimistic start\\n\\nThe judges\\' choice of Utzon\\'s bold and imaginative design was not without controversy. \"From the first, it stirred the people of Sydney to breathless wonder and scalding abuse,\" said Philpott. \"It was called the Sydney Harbour monster, a piece of Danish pastry, a disintegrating circus tent.\"\\n\\nPremier Cahill, worried that the project might be derailed by adverse public opinion or political opposition, pushed for construction work to start early. This was despite the fact that Utzon was still finalising the building\\'s actual design, and had yet to resolve critical structural issues. Although Utzon\\'s design was thought to be one of the cheapest, there were still problems raising money for it, so a State Lottery was launched in 1957 to help fund the project.\\n\\nThe initial estimate of the final cost of the Sydney Opera House was put at A£3.5m or A$7m – at the time, Australia\\'s official currency was the pound, but was replaced by the dollar in 1966. The building was set to open on 26 January 1963: Australia Day. Both of these predictions would prove to be wildly and hopelessly optimistic. \"Right from the beginning, the house was full of trouble: human, mechanical, structural,\" reported Philpott.\\n\\nThe building of the Opera House was divided into three distinct phases: construction of the podium, the roof shells, and the interior. Cahill, having persuaded the Minister of Transport to agree to the tram depot being demolished to build the podium, \"found the site was neither big enough nor strong enough to carry that structure that seemed on paper light enough to fly away,\" said Philpott.\\n\\nIf you went into a taxi, you got an earful of all the money that was being wasted – Sir Jack Zunz\\n\\nTo bear the weight of the Opera House, the whole site needed to be extended and reinforced by driving over 550 steel-cased concrete shafts, each three feet in diameter, into land in and around Sydney Harbour. This extensive work, which had not been accounted for in either the construction\\'s budget or its timescale, dragged on, hampered by bad weather. The podium would only be completed in January 1963 – the original date for when the Opera House was meant to open.\\n\\nBut this would merely be the first of the project\\'s delays and eye-watering extra costs. The Opera House\\'s most distinctive feature, its roof shells which mimicked a ship\\'s sails, were to present a whole other set of engineering headaches. Initially, the plan had been to make the roof out of steel coated with concrete. However, that design presented unwelcome noise problems for any performance taking place. \"The Opera House stars would have been singing above the sirens of the tugboats on the water outside, and the temperature variations would have caused the metal and concrete to rumble and crack like tropical thunder,\" said Philpott.\\n\\nGetty Images Danish architect Jørn Utzon in front of his under-construction creation – he resigned from the project in 1966, and never saw it completed (Credit: Getty Images)\\n\\nAn unbuildable building\\n\\nNobody had also fully understood the scale of the engineering challenge that the Opera House\\'s daring curved roof surfaces presented. Since Utzon\\'s entry lacked detailed engineering plans, civil engineering firm Arup had been brought in to work out how to construct the roof\\'s complex shell structure. But despite trying multiple different redesigns, they could not make the structural calculations add up. \"The first thing Arup did when they were asked to collaborate, they took these free shapes and developed a series of mathematical models which, near as possible, matched Utzon\\'s competition design. None of these shapes appeared buildable,\" Zunz told BBC Witness History.\\n\\nAnother issue was that, because the roof was curved, each concrete rib that supported it would be different. That meant that instead of having just one mould that could be reused to cast all the supporting beams, each individual rib would need a separate one. This was prohibitively expensive.\\n\\nThe answer, Utzon would later claim, came to him while he was peeling an orange. The architect realised that all segments of the roof could come from the geometry of a single sphere. By identifying which part of the sphere best suited the shapes they needed, a series of triangles each with one curved side could be cut from it, creating a variety of shells. These spherical shell segments could be broken down into individual components, which could be uniformly pre-cast in concrete and assembled onsite. \"He came back a week later and said, \\'I\\'ve solved it.\\' And he made the scheme out of a sphere,\" said Arup\\'s Zunz. \"But in so doing, he had changed the architecture quite radically.\"\\n\\nIn History In History is a series which uses the BBC\\'s unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\\n\\nThis elegant solution simplified the roof\\'s construction and reduced waste, enabling the building of the vaulted roof to begin in 1963. But as the contractors worked on executing Utzon\\'s vision, the project was dogged by labour disputes, design changes and rising material costs, making its budget balloon and its potential completion date disappear into the distance. \"By 1962, the cost had risen to A£12.5m, and now everybody admitted they were only guessing,\" said Philpott. \"The opening day was postponed and postponed again. It had been planned for Australia Day 1963, it was put off until early 1964, then until sometime in 1966, and now no one is bold enough even to predict the year the doors may eventually open.\"\\n\\nThe project\\'s biggest government supporter, Premier Cahill, had taken ill just months after building work had started. On his deathbed in 1959, he had made his Minister for Public Works, Norman Ryan, promise not to let the Opera House fail. Ryan, when interviewed by the BBC\\'s Philpott in 1965, gamely made a spirited defence of the project, but by this time frustration with its mounting costs and endless delays was palpable. \"I wasn\\'t sure whether to admit to working on it at the time,\" admitted Zunz. \"If you went into a taxi, you got an earful of all the money that was being wasted, and God knows what.\"\\n\\nAdding to this contentious atmosphere, a few months after Ryan\\'s BBC interview, Robert Askin, who had vocally opposed the project, was elected the New South Wales Premier. He appointed Davis Hughes as the new Minister for Public Works, who clashed repeatedly with Utzon. Hughes, determined to rein in spending, began to challenge the architect\\'s costs and schedules, demanding a full set of working drawings for the interiors – the next stage of the project. \"The whole situation started going downhill,\" said Zunz. \"Utzon couldn\\'t, wouldn\\'t, anyway didn\\'t produce the documents his client desired.\" In retaliation, Hughes refused the payments demanded by the construction team, which left Utzon unable to pay his staff. In 1966, the Danish architect resigned from the project and left Australia, never returning to see his Opera House completed.\\n\\nUtzon\\'s resignation led to a public outcry, with 1,000 people taking to Sydney\\'s streets on 3 March 1966 to demand that he be reinstated. Instead, Hughes appointed a new panel of Australian architects to complete the interior as well as the glass walls. But if Hughes thought this would reduce costs and speed up the project, he was very much mistaken.\\n\\nOvercoming the odds\\n\\nThe new team scrapped most of Utzon\\'s plans for the interior and radically redesigned it. Utzon had envisioned a dual purpose for the main hall, as an opera venue and a concert hall, but this was now viewed as unworkable, leading to the already installed stage production machinery having to be demolished. The new design also meant that each of the hundreds of pieces of glass in the interior walls needed to be cut to a unique size and shape, which continued to pile on the costs. The Sydney Opera House\\'s spiralling bill was pushed even higher when a labour dispute by union workers, over the dismissal of a worker and demands for better wages, culminated in a sit-in strike at the site in 1972.\\n\\nBut the following year, the monumental undertaking that was the construction of the Sydney Opera House was finally completed. Ten years late and 14 times over its initial budget, it came in at a cost of A$102m (£51m).\\n\\nIt was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973. The monarch praised the stunning building that had \"captured the imagination of the world\" while also wryly mentioning that \"I understand that its construction has not been totally without problems\". Utzon declined to attend its opening, writing to Premier Askin that he couldn\\'t \"see anything positive\" in the interior work done by the Australian architects and it would not be possible for him \"to avoid making very negative statements\".\\n\\nThe Danish architect did end up making peace and reengaging with the Sydney Opera House project in 1999, agreeing to work on the A$66m (£33m) renovation of its interior. In September 2004, the Reception Hall was renamed the Utzon Room in his honour after being redesigned by him.\\n\\nIn the years since its completion, acclaim for Sydney Opera House\\'s visionary architecture has only grown. Its distinctive sculptural form has made it one of the most immediately recognisable buildings in the world. More than 10.9m people visit it annually, and it has come to epitomise the Australian national identity, its soaring roof a celebration of creativity, culture and ambition in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.\\n\\nAs a venue, it has played host to everyone from Bob Dylan, Ella Fitzgerald and Sammy Davis Jnr to The Cure, Björk and Massive Attack. In 1980, Arnold Schwarzenegger won his final body-building title there, and 10 years later anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela made one of his first major speeches from its steps following his release from prison. In 2004, Cathy Freeman, the first Aboriginal athlete to win an individual Olympic gold medal, opened the Olympic torch relay from outside the building. Its eye-catching roof is illuminated every year as part of Vivid Sydney, the city\\'s festival of light, music and ideas, and in 2017, stories of Indigenous Australia told in vibrant animations were projected onto it.\\n\\nIn 2007, the building that had been brought about by a combination of art, engineering and sheer bloody-minded perseverance was formally recognised as a World Heritage Site by Unesco. On recommending its inclusion, the International Council on Monuments and Sites declared: \"The Sydney Opera House stands by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity, not only in the 20th Century but in the history of humankind.\"\\n\\n--\\n\\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the In History newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.'},\n",

Assoonas/Getty Images\\n\\nCredit card debt can spiral out of control faster than you may realize, especially in today's high-rate environment. With the average credit card interest rate hovering around 23% and retail store cards carrying rates closer to 30%, even a small balance can quickly compound, so what might have started as a few necessary purchases can turn into a major issue over time. And, if you don't find a solution quickly, the increasing interest charges and growing debt can make it harder to escape with each passing month.\\n\\nHigh rates aren't the only problem right now, though. While inflation has cooled from recent highs, it's ticking back up quickly. That, in turn, is leaving many people with less disposable income to put toward their credit card balances. The higher costs for essentials like groceries, gas and rent also mean that more people are relying on credit cards just to get by, deepening their financial struggles. As a result, many cardholders are now barely chipping away at the principal balance they owe while interest continues to accrue.\\n\\nGiven today's economic hurdles, it can be helpful to understand how much of your paycheck should go toward paying off your credit card debt. Without a clear strategy, it's easy to remain in debt for years on end — but having a repayment plan in place that balances aggressive debt reduction with your other obligations can help you avoid this type of long-term financial strain.\\n\\nSpeak to a debt relief expert about your options now.\\n\\nHow much of your paycheck should go to credit card debt?\\n\\nA good rule of thumb is to allocate at least 20% of your paycheck to paying down debt, including your credit card balances. This recommendation comes from the popular 50/30/20 budgeting rule, which suggests spending 50% of your income on necessities, 30% on discretionary expenses and 20% on savings and debt repayment. However, this is merely a suggestion. The percentage of your paycheck that should go toward credit card debt depends on several factors, including:\\n\\nYour total debt burden: If credit cards represent just one type of debt among others, you'll need to balance these obligations. Still, credit card interest rates are typically much higher than other loans, so they should generally receive the largest portion of your debt repayment budget.\\n\\nYour essential expenses: After accounting for necessities like housing, food, utilities and transportation, determine how much of the remaining funds can realistically go toward debt. If you're stretched thin covering basics, you may need to look for expenses to cut or ways to increase income.\\n\\nThe severity of your debt situation: For those with significant credit card debt relative to their income, more aggressive action may be necessary. In extreme cases, committing 30% or more of take-home pay toward credit card debt might be appropriate until the balances are under control.\\n\\nYour emergency fund status: While paying down debt is crucial, maintaining a small emergency fund prevents new debt accumulation when unexpected expenses arise.

       "   'content': \"CNN —\\n\\nThe US Food and Drug Administration’s new standards for foods before they can be labeled as “healthy” on their packaging will go into effect about two months later than planned, according to a government document scheduled to be published in the Federal Register on Tuesday.\\n\\nIn December, the FDA finalized a rule that updates the nutritional requirements a human food item must meet to claim on its packaging that it is “healthy.” That final rule was published with an effective date of February 25, 2025.\\n\\nBut in January, President Donald Trump issued a memorandum entitled “Regulatory Freeze Pending Review,” which in part puts a freeze on new rules until a department or agency head appointed or designated by the President reviews and approves the rule as well as orders agencies to postpone the effective date for any rules that may have been published in the Federal Register but have not taken effect, for the purpose of review.\\n\\n“In accordance with this direction, FDA is delaying the effective date of the final rule ‘Food Labeling: Nutrient Content Claims; Definition of Term “Healthy”’ (89 FR 106064), until April 28, 2025. We note that the compliance date remains unchanged at this time,” according to the document.\\n\\nUse of “healthy” labeling is voluntary for food manufacturers. Foods that meet the new requirements can start using the label once the rule is effective, while those that don’t currently meet the standards of the new rule still have until 2028 or three years to conform.\\n\\nAmong the requirements, the final rule includes limits on added sugars, saturated fat and sodium for foods to be labeled as “healthy,” and “healthy” foods must also contain a certain amount of a key food group, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats or low-fat dairy. The rule also sets forth requirements for establishing and maintaining certain records for foods bearing the “healthy” claim.\\n\\nAbout 5% of all packaged foods in the current marketplace are labeled as “healthy,” according to the final rule. Some foods that could previously carry the healthy label — such as white bread and heavily sweetened cereal and yogurt — will no longer qualify. But nuts and seeds, salmon and olive oil and some peanut butters and canned fruits and vegetables are among those that will newly qualify.\\n\\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\\n\\n“The last time ‘healthy’ was defined on packaging was in the 1990s. Based on the nutrition science and federal dietary guidelines at that time, the definition was solely focused on individual nutrients; for example, it included limits for saturated fat, total fat, cholesterol, and sodium and required a certain amount of beneficial nutrients like certain vitamins, minerals, fiber, and protein,” according to a webpage on the FDA’s website, which contains content current as of Monday. “Today, we have a greater understanding of dietary patterns and their effects on health, and we recognize that foods are made up of a variety of nutrients that work together as part of a healthy dietary pattern.”\"},\n",

       "   'content': 'As a cancer survivor, watching Netflix’s new show “Apple Cider Vinegar” felt like a gut punch. The show captures the exhaustion and desperation many cancer patients feel, and the seductive allure of ditching traditional medicine for the promise of a “natural” cure. It also exposes the dark underbelly of the alternative health industry — a world where quacks and influencers prey on the vulnerable. They speak with unwavering confidence, yet their claims are backed by zero peer-reviewed evidence.\\n\\nI know this all too well ... because I almost fell for it myself.\\n\\nI was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer in December 2022. I immediately began scheduling consultations with surgeons, but most appointments were pushed to mid- or late January because of the holidays. With weeks to wait, I decided to use the time proactively — or so I thought — and met with Dr. T, an integrative medical doctor, to explore if supplements could support my health while I waited for treatment.\\n\\nWhile Dr. T fully backed my decision to pursue surgery, she mentioned another holistic practitioner, Dr. D, who specialized in thermography. She explained that thermography — a thermal imaging technique that maps blood flow on the breast’s surface — potentially can identify areas of abnormal heat linked to inflammation or tumors.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhat caught my attention, though, was her offhand remark that Dr. D had allegedly “healed” a breast cancer patient without surgery, radiation or chemotherapy. As a science writer curious about holistic medicine, I was intrigued. Could thermography detect my cancer? I decided to find out.\\n\\nThe author shortly before breast-conserving surgery at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C. Courtesy Jennie Durant\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhen I arrived at Dr. D’s office, I noticed that it felt more like a spa than a medical clinic — a welcome change from the windowless rooms with fluorescent lighting where I’d gotten my breast screens.\\n\\nThe thermogram process involved nine thermal images taken with a special camera, followed by a “cold challenge” where I submerged my hands in icy water to test how my body responded. I was told that healthy tissue cools in sync with the brain’s signals, while cancerous or inflamed areas resist the change and show up as hot spots on the thermogram.\\n\\nI was fascinated, but I couldn’t ignore the red flags: thermograms aren’t FDA approved as standalone tests for detecting breast cancer, and the technician operating the machine turned out to be the doctor’s wife.\\n\\nAfter waiting for 30 minutes for my results — an eternity that left me uneasy — Dr. D finally called me into his office. And then, things took a bizarre turn.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFirst, he showed me the rainbow-colored thermogram report and acknowledged that it hadn’t detected my cancer — in fact, he seemed visibly flustered by the imaging fail. Instead, it had only revealed “extra heat” in the area, putting me in the “high-risk” category.\\n\\nThen, he revealed his theory: My cancer was caused by “too many COVID vaccines,” and I shouldn’t get another. I was too stunned to respond. Not only is there zero evidence linking COVID vaccines to breast cancer or other “turbo cancers,” the claim flew in the face of my personal history.\\n\\n“What about the fact that my mom had the same type of cancer, in the same breast, at the same age?” I asked.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHe dismissed this outright. “No, it’s definitely the vaccines,” he insisted, before pivoting to his next pitch: Super Mineral Water, a product he sold in his clinic, which he claimed could “detox” my body and possibly help cure me.\\n\\nBy then, I was equally horrified and embarrassed — not just by his quackery, but by my naiveté for walking into this mess. I grabbed my things and left as quickly as I could.\\n\\nThe author ringing a bell after finishing a month of radiation treatment at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C. Courtesy Jennie Durant\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAfter my experience, I turned to the internet and stumbled on some comment boards about thermograms. One post led me to the story of Morganne Delian, a believer in homeopathic medicine who opted for a thermogram instead of a mammogram to detect cancer when she felt a lump in her breast. The thermogram practitioner reportedly told Delian that he couldn’t see a lump but warned she had “mild to moderate risk of developing aggressive breast tissue.” Months later, after finally undergoing a mammogram and a biopsy, she was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer.\\n\\nStories like Delian’s are chilling reminders of the potential dangers posed by unproven screening tools and alternative therapies. From coffee enemas and Gerson therapy (a real-life version of the Hirsch method in “Apple Cider Vinegar”), to black salve, intravenous vitamin C, alkaline diets, homeopathy and energy healing, these practices are aggressively marketed by doctors, chiropractors and clinicians, even though they lack the necessary scientific testing and evidence to prove they work.\\n\\nSo why are so many people still drawn to these alternatives? Part of it, I think, is the allure of control in a moment when you feel paralyzed with terror. A cancer diagnosis strips you of your agency — your body feels like a traitor and your treatment plan is dictated by a team of experts that you’ve just met. Alternative medicine offers the illusion of empowerment and personalized care. Quacks don’t bog you down with statistics, side effects or limitations — they offer hope and simplicity. In a world where cancer treatments are scary or difficult to understand, that simplicity and hope can become irresistible.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAfter my diagnosis, one of the best things I did was learn to trust my cancer team and the science that guided them. I abandoned my wishful thinking — the fantasy of the “lovely healing experience,” like Milla’s tropical Hirsch retreat in “Apple Cider Vinegar.” Instead, I embraced the stark reality of white hospital walls and a windowless operating room, where my surgeon skillfully removed my tumor and left me cancer free.\\n\\nThe author and her husband at the D.C. Cherry Blossom Festival, a couple of weeks after finding out she was cancer free. Courtesy Jennie Durant\\n\\nNow, I get an annual mammogram and breast MRI, the recommended screening protocol for women like me who are high risk and have dense breasts. I also take tamoxifen daily, a preventative medicine that I’ll take for at least five years, or for as long as my oncologist advises. Why? Because she’s the expert — not me.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nScience saved my life. It saves lives every day. Yet, we’re in a dangerous moment when people distrust the regulators and science communities tasked with protecting them, while placing blind faith in politicians and influencers who profit from our vulnerability. ”Apple Cider Vinegar” exposes the dark side of these charismatic characters — people who lie as easily as they breathe. It’s a stark reminder why we need to trust science now, more than ever.\\n\\nThe question is: Will we listen?\\n\\nNote: Some names and identifying characteristics have been changed to protect the privacy of individuals in this essay.\\n\\nJennie Durant is a science writer, researcher and breast cancer survivor with a book on bee declines coming out with Island Press in 2026.

       "   'content': 'visualspace via Getty Images Motion sickness commonly happens when looking at your phone as you ride in a car, but Apple has a fix.\\n\\nAnyone who has ever sat in the back of a car or bus probably understands the motion sickness ― nausea, headache and dizziness ― that can come from reading a book or staring at a screen while in a moving vehicle. Research says it’s quite common, with 59% of people reporting experiencing the phenomena either in adulthood or childhood.\\n\\nIf anything, the advent of smartphones makes motion sickness even more common. Who hasn’t checked emails and social media as they ride in the passenger seat?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMotion sickness stems from our balance system, which is “made up of a few different parts, including your vision ... your inner ear, as well as balance sensors in all of your muscles throughout your body,” said Dr. Mohamed Elrakhawy, an assistant professor in the department of otorhinolaryngology, head and neck surgery at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.\\n\\n“And all that information has to come together, and the brain has to integrate it to make sense of it so that you have a good sense of where you are in space and if you’re moving, what direction you’re moving,” he added.\\n\\nWhen motion sickness happens, the theory is there’s a disconnect between what your eyes are seeing and what your inner ears are feeling, Elrakhawy noted. In other words, there’s confusion among these senses.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“Some people feel that they’re moving while their eyes are telling them they’re not moving, or their eyes can be telling them that they should be moving, but their inner ear says, no, you’re not moving,” Elrakhawy continued.\\n\\nFor those who deal with motion sickness while using their Apple devices in a car, the company implemented a motion sickness fix via its iOS 18 release last year. On both iPhones and iPads, Apple added animated dots to the periphery of the screen that move along with the car’s movement to reduce the eye-ear discrepancy that can lead to motion sickness.\\n\\nElrakhawy explained that these dots mimic the movement the driver sees as they’re driving the car. (And drivers, generally, don’t get car sick.)\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“When you’re in the driver’s seat, you’re in control and you can anticipate which way you’re going to be moving, and therefore, the brain has good signals of what’s going on,” Elrakhawy said. “I think the idea with [the dots] is that if the iPhone that you’re holding is detecting the motion of the car, it will give your eyes a clue with these dots.”\\n\\nThese dots sync what your body is feeling with what your body is seeing so you don’t have the mismatch in sensory signals that causes motion sickness, he explained.\\n\\nIt goes without saying that folks driving a vehicle shouldn’t be looking at their phone, so this motion sickness feature is meant for people who are passengers.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHere’s how to use the motion sickness feature on your iPhone or iPad:\\n\\nOn your iPhone or iPad, the setting is technically called vehicle motion cues.\\n\\nIt can be reached by following these steps: Go to Settings > Accessibility > Motion.\\n\\nClick on “Show vehicle motion cues” and choose from three settings: “Off,” “Automatic” (which will turn the feature on whenever your device detects that you’re in a car) or “On” (which will keep the dots on your screen at all times).\\n\\nWhat else can you do for motion sickness?\\n\\nAs with anything health-related, your motion sickness is going to be different than your neighbor’s. Some folks online say the Apple feature worked for them, while others said it made their motion sickness worse.\\n\\nYou can give the feature a try and see how it goes for you. And if it doesn’t work, there are additional ways to get rid of the ensuing motion sickness.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“If you can look out on the horizon, say you are looking out of the window, just looking up and actually focusing on one thing as you’re traveling might be helpful to stabilize your gaze and reconcile the difference of what’s happening on the outside versus what you’re feeling,” Elrakhawy suggested.\\n\\nIt’s also helpful to keep your head still for a little bit, he said. Or, you can try over-the-counter antihistamine like Dramamine, which is designed to keep motion sickness at bay.\\n\\nYou can also talk to your doctor about prescription patches if you find that your motion sickness is really getting in the way of your day-to-day life, he added.\\n\\nAdvertisement'},\n",

       "   'content': 'The popular new Netflix series, “Apple Cider Vinegar,” based largely on the true story of Australian wellness influencer and fraudster Belle Gibson, affected me deeply. Gibson claimed her wellness treatments cured her terminal brain cancer, a brazen and consequential lie that risked the lives of her followers.\\n\\nAs a two-time breast cancer survivor, I know cancer treatments are not for the fainthearted or noncompliant. But they have kept me — and millions of others — alive. Meanwhile, research shows patients who reject or delay the advice of their doctors are much more likely to die.\\n\\nToday, after an ordeal including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, I am 10 months cancer-free. And free, also, to binge this drama, enraged by the premise.\\n\\nIn the warped world inhabited by so-called wellness warriors, a strong person rejects conformity, and a weak person passively complies with the medical establishment.\\n\\nIn the warped world inhabited by so-called wellness warriors, a strong person rejects conformity, and a weak person passively complies with the medical establishment. This argument distorts the global medical community, twisting “the establishment” into a nefarious moneymaking conspiracy. But while Big Pharma does rake in billions, cancer treatment is not a scam. And influencers who try to lure vulnerable people away from established science are toxic, in every sense of the word. Just as we have seen with Covid deniers and vaccine skeptics, disinformation can kill.\\n\\nI could not watch any movie, series, program or TEDx talk on cancer while I was in the middle of my own treatments and recovery. There was nothing entertaining about the stories, or the characters — too many of whom died. I just knew I didn’t want to be like them.\\n\\nWhen I was first diagnosed with Stage 1 breast cancer in 2006, I eagerly did everything my surgeon and oncologist told me to do. I got the lumpectomy. I submitted to the prescribed brachytherapy (internal seed radiation) twice daily for one week and many years of Tamoxifen, a hormone-blocking medication with uncomfortable and inconvenient side effects.\\n\\nI wanted to live. And I trusted my doctors and medical team wanted me to live as much as I did.\\n\\nA single mom with sole custody of three sons, then 13, 16 and 18, I wanted to see them all through high school, college, weddings, my grandchildren and my eventual retirement.\\n\\nAlmost two decades later, in June 2023, a second breast cancer identified as triple-negative, invasive, aggressive Stage 3 showed up on my ultrasound. The three tumors measured 7 centimeters all together. Once again, I did absolutely everything my oncologist, surgeon and cardiologist ordered — including eliminating alcohol after reading about the link between drinking and cancer. I also gave up diet soda at the suggestion of my oncologist. Why not?\\n\\nBecause the truth is that cancer is scary. And highly motivating. The other main protagonist in “Apple Cider Vinegar” is Milla Blake, a character who seems at least partly inspired by a real woman named Jessica Ainscough. Diagnosed with a rare cancer in her early 20s, Ainscough eventually stopped chemo and adopted an intense (and unproven) regimen of juices and coffee enemas. I deeply empathized with her honesty, vulnerability and courage as she searched for answers. She was aiming to fight for herself, not build a wellness empire based on lies.\\n\\nBut Ainscough also reportedly convinced her mother to forgo doctor recommendations and try the alternative therapy route. Her mother died from breast cancer in 2013. Ainscough would succumb to her own cancer a few years later. A tragedy layered on top of a tragedy.\\n\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that in 2022, the latest year numbers are available, over 600,000 people in the United States died from cancer. There are 18 million people with a history of cancer who are still alive, according to the American Cancer Society.\\n\\nSurvival rates vary by cancer type, diagnosis timeline and various other personal variants. But the overall five-year survival rate for breast cancer in women is 90% — if those women follow the recommended surgery, chemotherapy and radiation protocol.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the Mayo Clinic notes that alternative treatments may be able to help with some symptoms, but they are not cures. If they were, doctors would use them.\\n\\nMichele Weldon rings a bell signifying the end of her cancer treatment. Courtesy Michele Weldon\\n\\nAs accurately presented in the series by screenwriter Samantha Strauss, chemotherapy is almost intolerable; my own treatments were cut short and surgery for a radical mastectomy moved up more than three months because my system could not handle the stress.\\n\\nI also went completely bald, just as the character Lucy did in the series. I wore a wig for a bit, until my hair began to grow back months after radiation ended. Chemo gave me mouth sores and made everything taste like gasoline; I ultimately lost more than 30 pounds.\\n\\nAnd still, I listened to the experts. Any anger I felt was directed at my cancer, not at my doctors. Unlike in most every other aspect of my professional and personal life, when dealing with cancer, I was completely obedient.\\n\\nA number of my friends have had their own cancer experiences, and I adamantly advise them to do everything their doctors and nurses recommend. I darkly joke that I spent my 30s sending flowers to my friends in hospitals having babies; in my 60s, I send flowers to my friends in hospitals having surgeries.\\n\\nUltimately, the tragedies presented in “Apple Cider Vinegar” are real. But there is nothing inherently weak about following the science. And nothing inherently brave about ignoring it.'},\n",

Records from the facilities involved showed that the shakes were available to residents and patients, the FDA said.\\n\\nThe FDA said it was first notified of an outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes linked to the product on Nov. 25 last year \"with many ill people residing in long-term care facilities (LTCF) prior to illness onset.\"\\n\\n\"As soon as Lyons Magnus learned of the issue, it took immediate action to halt the purchase of all products from the affected Prairie Farms facility, notify customers, and ensure that impacted products were removed from distribution nationally,\" the company said in its statement.\\n\\nThe FDA said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that this outbreak can be traced back to 2018, although it was not clear exactly how, when or where the infections were reported.\\n\\nSymptoms of Listeriosis, a listeria infection, typically start two weeks after eating contaminated food but can start up to 10 weeks later. These may include fever, muscle aches and nausea and in serious cases confusion, stiff neck and convulsions. Pregnant women, people over the age of 65 and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk.\\n\\nAn infant died and 10 adults were sickened amid a four-state listeria outbreak connected to ready-to-eat meat products last year.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'If you deal with frequent small messes, or you hate lugging out your full-size, plug-in vacuum cleaner, a cordless stick vacuum could be your dream cleaning partner. But like a good marriage, a cordless stick vacuum requires some compromises. We’ve tested dozens of models, and the perfect one just doesn’t exist.\\n\\nThis sturdy, versatile vacuum has excellent suction power, and it comes with several ingenious attachments. It stands on its own and recharges quickly, but it’s heavier and less agile than our other picks.\\n\\nThis model is not as nimble as our top picks, but it’s an excellent cleaner, it has a large dustbin, and it comes with several useful tools.\\n\\nThis model performs about as well as the Dyson V12, and it comes with a station that automatically empties the dustbin when the vacuum is docked. It struggles with fur, though.\\n\\nThis nimble, high-tech model is light, powerful, and easy to maneuver. But it doesn’t stand up on its own, and the dustbin is tiny.\\n\\nFor each vacuum, we noted how easy and comfortable it was to maneuver, and we looked at whether the attachments fit their purpose.\\n\\nWe looked for cordless stick vacuums with at least a two-year warranty, as well as a replaceable battery—a major plus.\\n\\nWe measured how much baking soda, cereal, birdseed, glitter, and hair each vac pulled from four types of rugs and bare floors.\\n\\nWe’ve tested hundreds of vacuums over more than a decade, most recently evaluating 34 cordless stick models priced from $100 to $1,000.\\n\\nThe Dyson V12 Detect Slim comes closer to being an ideal stick vac than any model we’ve tested. It’s light and nimble around furniture and on stairs, and it even works on shelves, walls, and ceilings.\\n\\nIn suction, airflow, and cleaning power, the V12 Detect Slim rivals more-expensive vacuums (such as the Dyson V15). And the V12 comes with multiple brushes and attachments, including a motorized brush for pet hair. It runs for 45 minutes on a single charge—longer than most of the other vacuums we’ve tested.\\n\\nThis stick vacuum has high-tech features that make it almost fun to use; they include a sensor that automatically adjusts suction, a laser headlight that illuminates dust in dim corners, and an LCD screen with a battery countdown and other information. This stick vac is also one of the quietest models we’ve tested.\\n\\nThe V12’s biggest downside is its tiny, 12-ounce dustbin, which requires frequent emptying, particularly if you have pets. You also have to swap between two different brushes, depending on whether you use the vacuum on carpet or the bare floor.\\n\\nIt takes the V12 four hours to recharge—longer than it takes most other models—and it doesn’t stand up on its own. Dyson covers the V12 with a two-year warranty.\\n\\nAdvertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThe Shark PowerDetect Clean & Empty Cordless Vacuum is a powerful cleaner with an option for a self-emptying dock; this is an increasingly popular feature on stick vacuums because it reduces dust exposure and maintenance. In our tests, this model excelled at picking up Cheerios, birdseed, sand, and dust, performing on a par with our other picks. Its dual-brush cleaner head effectively handles debris on hard floors and carpets.\\n\\nLike the Dyson V12, this vacuum has three modes, including an auto-detect feature that adjusts power for carpets. An LED screen monitors charge levels, and a versatile wand with an adjustable angle makes it easier to clean under furniture. The Shark PowerDetect struggles with pet fur, and it’s notably louder than our other picks.\\n\\nThis vacuum has a small bin, but the self-emptying dock (available as an add-on) can alleviate that by automatically sucking debris into a larger canister.\\n\\nThe Shark PowerDetect comes with a five-year warranty—the longest one among our picks. But finding replacement parts, including batteries, can be difficult.\\n\\nMost cordless stick vacuums that cost less than $200 are terrible. The Tineco GO Pet (often on sale for around $150) is a rare exception. It rivaled our top picks in pickup power, efficiently and reliably sucking up sand, Cheerios, birdseed, and dust. (It even outperformed a pricier Tineco model we tried.)\\n\\nThis vacuum includes a single cleaner head, so it eliminates the hassle of having to switch heads when you’re transitioning from bare floors to rugs and wall-to-wall carpeting. However, the Tineco Pro Pet seizes on certain lightweight rugs.\\n\\nWith a generous, 34-ounce dustbin, the GO Pet is designed with bulky fur in mind. It quickly transforms into a handheld vacuum, and it comes with several useful tools, including a mini power brush, for tackling fur on upholstery, and a combination brush tool, for dusting and getting crumbs off of above-floor surfaces.\\n\\nThe GO Pet has a decent runtime of 38 minutes, and it’s lightweight and agile, maneuvering smoothly around chairs and tables. But it’s noisier than other stick vacs, and its dustbin can be annoying to reassemble. It comes with a three-year warranty, and the battery is replaceable (but finding one is a hassle.)\\n\\nThe Ryobi 18V One+ HP Advanced Stick Vacuum Kit is a bulky yet well-rounded workhorse, so it’s a great choice both for homes and for garages.\\n\\nIn our tests, this model readily picked up debris particles of different sizes and weights on all types of floors—it even rivaled the Dyson V12 in our sand-pickup tests. Its large, 33-ounce dustbin won’t quickly fill up with debris or fur, so this vac is ideal for people with pets and workshops.\\n\\nIts motorized cleaner head works on bare floors and on carpet (you don’t have to swap brushes, as you do with the Dyson V12 Detect Slim). And it comes with a variety of useful attachments, including an excellent motorized brush tool, for pet hair, and a surprisingly useful micro crevice tool, for getting into tight cracks. But this model is heavy and less agile than our other picks.\\n\\nThe vacuum stands upright on its own and runs for up to 32 minutes. The battery charges in two hours (one of the fastest charge times we saw in our tests). And the battery is widely available and compatible with various Ryobi machines, so it’s a good choice if you already own One+ Ryobi tools. It has a limited three-year warranty.'},\n",

       "   'content': '“I bought my home in a hurry in 2020,” said Meg, 60, an office manager from Maryland. “It was less expensive to take on a mortgage than to keep paying ever-increasing rents for my college-student daughter and me.”\\n\\nNow housing costs consume 50% of her income.\\n\\nAlthough Meg said she felt “grateful to have our little house”, the purchase has lost its luster. Her aging row home needs various repairs, while other costs associated with home ownership rose continually too.\\n\\n“I had to take out an additional mortgage to replace the heat and AC system,” she said. “I keep increasing the deductibles on the home insurance to try to keep the premiums down. They ratchet up every year, while my income does not. I won’t be able to do more repairs unless our circumstances change significantly. Our necessities consume 75% of my income, with 50% of that housing costs.”\\n\\nMeg was among scores of homeowners from across the US who shared with the Guardian how much they have been struggling with the rising cost of home ownership.\\n\\nElevated mortgage and loan interest rates, exploding home insurance premiums and rising property taxes in many parts of the country, as well as higher costs for energy and eye-watering costs for home maintenance works have flipped the dream of owning a home into a nightmare for many Americans.\\n\\nHomeowners who had assumed their properties would become valuable assets and provide security described their homes as “money pits” and “financial burdens”, and said they felt stuck in homes they could barely or no longer afford, with insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance now often costing more than people’s mortgages.\\n\\n“I’ve come to view home ownership and healthcare as destabilizing forces in my life,” said Bernie, a 45-year-old network engineer from Minneapolis. To finance owning his and his wife’s $300,000 home and saving for the future, the couple was foregoing medical and dental treatment of any kind and cutting back on expenses everywhere, he said, despite a pre-tax household income of more than $250,000.\\n\\n“In four years we plan to sell our home and move full-time into an RV,” Bernie said. “Our house provides no security.”\\n\\nCosts are overwhelming, if I could get rid of this house I absolutely would Amie\\n\\nAmie, 44, a self-employed writer from rural Maine, purchased her $260,000 home in 2020, securing a 30-year fixed mortgage at an attractive 3.5% interest rate.\\n\\n“Although my mortgage is reasonable, the price for anything else is causing considerable financial stress for my partner and me,” she said.\\n\\n“Home oil costs are astronomical. The cost to make energy efficient repairs such as new windows, improved insulation, or heat pump installation are beyond our financial reach.\\n\\n“Quotes to redo our roof range between $65,000 and $140,000, more than I make in a year. Home equity loan interest rates are at 11% now around here, and I’m scared to commit to such a big loan at the risk of losing my house if I can’t pay the monthly fee.”\\n\\nProperty taxes of about $4,000 annually are another worry. “They just went up again,” Amie said. “I recently had to create a payment plan for the electricity bills. If we could build a small holding on this land and get rid of this house I absolutely would. It’s completely overwhelming. I feel trapped.”\\n\\nAmie’s concerns were echoed by many who said they now wanted to rid themselves of homes that had become too expensive to own and maintain, but felt mostly unable to do so: selling and moving somewhere cheaper, various people said, would force them onto higher interest mortgages; others said they had considered going back to renting, but had concluded this was not feasible either due to exponentially rising rents in many parts of the US.\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Stephanie moved across the US and gave up on traditional home ownership to escape unaffordable housing costs. Photograph: Handout\\n\\nStephanie, a 49-year-old psychotherapist, sold her Massachusetts home and moved to Colorado, where she, her sister and her fiance purchased a manufactured home for $130,000.\\n\\n“It’s all we could afford given our student loans and my temporary disability due to multiple surgeries in seven months,” she said. “I don’t believe it’s feasible for me to own a non-manufactured home again. After I sold my last home, I walked away with only $200k, after 17 years of mortgage payments and large expenditures on upkeep.“\\n\\nWhile the resale value of manufactured homes can be very low, Stephanie hopes to evade costly repairs because of her new home’s simplicity, as well as the risk of falling into mortgage arrears in times of illness.\\n\\nVarious older people who had either paid their homes off already or were expecting to be mortgage-free soon said they would likely have to sell and relocate to areas with lower taxes for homeowners, among them 60-year-old Angela, a product manager from a southern Chicago suburb.\\n\\n“I bought this house 19 years ago for $220,000,” she said. “If I’m lucky, I can sell it for $300,000.” Local house prices, she said, had not gone up by very much in all this time, in part because local property taxes were prohibitively expensive.\\n\\nI just did not expect my home insurance costs to go up like that in my retirement Jane\\n\\n“We have this huge tax burden here, it has really gotten out of control. Property taxes increased by $3,100 last year. I now pay $8,800 per year on a home I can perhaps only sell for $280,000. I’m in a better position than most people and make a decent salary today, $170,000.\\n\\n“But I’m thinking – how do I afford these taxes in retirement? I’m cutting back on everything.”\\n\\nAnxious about her property taxes eating up funds she will need for her retirement, Angela has been exploring a move to a rural area with a lower tax burden.\\n\\n“But those very rural areas tend to be more conservative. This nation is so divided, I might be totally isolated in some of these places,” she said.\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Jane, from California, is facing the loss of her home due to unaffordable fire insurance. Photograph: Handout\\n\\nOlder homeowners said they had not anticipated having to meet such rapidly increasing home ownership costs when they had begun planning their retirement finances decades prior.\\n\\nJane, 69, a pensioner from rural California, was among people who said their homes had become unaffordable primarily because of soaring insurance rates in their natural disaster-prone areas.\\n\\nWith approximately $100,000 of her mortgage still outstanding on a home that is in a high-risk fire area, her savings are being eaten up by fire insurance costs and she has taken on more credit card debt.\\n\\n“We bought the house in 2008 for $190,000,” Jane said. “The cost for fire insurance is skyrocketing, my rates jumped from $3,200 a year to $7,886 in October. Maybe I should have planned better, but fire insurance wasn’t a thing when I bought this property. I just did not expect costs to go up like that in my retirement.”\\n\\nHer fixed social security income of $2,000 also makes it tough to keep up with more expensive propane and electricity. “I had savings, but I only have enough for one more year, $10,000. I don’t know what to do. I’m very scared.”\\n\\nJody, a mental health professional from Florida in her 50s, said she was among the many Americans who have given up on insuring their homes, as rates are increasingly unaffordable and coverage is too poor.\\n\\nI have no homeowners insurance, like many, many of my neighbours Jody\\n\\nHomeowners insurance on her mortgage-free manufactured home would cost $5,000, she said, with an annual deductible of $8,000 and coverage of maximally $60,000 – a lot less than it would cost to replace the home if it was destroyed.\\n\\n“As a result, I have no homeowners insurance, like many, many of my neighbors,” she said. “No average person, even in a dual income [household], can afford to own a home here anymore. I’m selling and moving back to Michigan.”\\n\\nWhen a tornado last year tore through the mortgage-free home of Connie Jones, a 63-year-old graphic artist from Wisconsin, her insurer of nearly 20 years declined to pay for most of the damage in the neighbourhood, forcing the family to take out loans of $19,500 for roof and fence repairs.\\n\\n“We will have to put off retirement to make the payments,” Jones said. “Owning our home is too expensive and we are considering other options.\\n\\nView image in fullscreen The home of Connie Jones, purchased in 1997, was supposed to be a family asset, but has been swallowing large amounts of money over the years. Photograph: Connie Jones/Guardian Community\\n\\n“We’re debating whether to sell and move to a more affordable area or keep our property for an inheritance for our daughter. Property taxes are almost $4,000 a year and keep increasing. We really don’t know if it’s all worth it and definitely feel like we can’t balance all the costs of owning a home. We have enough equity [to buy again], however we are leaning more to renting our home in future.”\\n\\nI’ve had to take out a mortgage, as a senior citizen to pay off nearly $100,000 of high interest credit card loans I had to pay for the upkeep of the house Patricia\\n\\nPatricia, a pensioner in her 70s from rural Massachusetts, was one of several people who said they had been forced to take on significant debt in old age to keep being able to meet their home ownership costs.\\n\\nHaving built her three-bedroom house in 1985 for about $250,000, the property is now valued at between $450,000 and $525,000, an appreciation which, Patricia said, was being largely cancelled out by the ongoing, rising costs of owning the home.\\n\\n“I was mortgage-free from 1985 until 2025, but recently I’ve had to take out a mortgage, as a senior citizen, at around 10% interest to pay off nearly $100,000 of high interest credit card loans I had to pay for the upkeep of the house,” she said.\\n\\nPatricia now fears she will not be able to downsize eventually, as the proceeds of her home sale, after her property loan is deducted, will be too small to buy again in a small town in the area.\\n\\nI had considered finding senior roommates, but was forced out in the end Bill Howard\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Bill Howard at Jardín Botánico de Medellín in August 2023. Photograph: Bill/Guardian Community\\n\\nBill Howard, 67, was among various pensioners who said they had realised that staying in the US was financially no longer possible for them, as their fixed retirement incomes had no chance of keeping up with rising housing costs.\\n\\nHe had tried to hold on to his late mother’s home in Reno, Nevada, which was increasing in value.\\n\\n“I had considered using a service to find senior roommates, but Reno is in a wildfire zone, my home insurance was rising. I knew I was not going to be able to sustain this,” Howard said. He maxed out several credit cards to fund home repairs in preparation for the sale, and moved to Medellín, Colombia, the day after the house went on the market.\\n\\n“I took two suitcases with me and started life over at 66 in July 2024,” he said. “It was incredibly painful to leave everything behind. There were many reasons why I wanted to stay; it felt like being forced out.”\\n\\nFortunately, Howard now feels happy about the move, and is about to buy an affordable apartment in Medellín. “You go from being scared to death living in the United States to thinking: ‘OK, things will work out, because the cost of living here is lower’ – a few hundred a month instead of thousands.”\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Morgan, from Philadelphia, is no longer sure whether buying his home was a good financial investment. Photograph: Morgan/Guardian Community\\n\\nMorgan, a 36-year-old associate director of brand partnerships at a fashion company from Philadelphia, only recently got onto the property ladder, but now worries his house purchase may become a permanent financial drain.\\n\\n“My insurance just increased by $150 per month, and with higher utilities my total monthly home expenses have risen by about $300 to $400. I’ve depleted some of my savings,” he said.\\n\\n“I’ve had to prioritize discretionary expenses and have cut down the number of times per month I’m seeing a therapist. I have considered selling my house to cut down on expenses, but I only bought a year and a half ago and I’d prefer not to sell yet so I don’t lose money on closing costs.”\\n\\nThe political and economic uncertainty is further adding to Morgan’s concerns.\\n\\n“I worry,” he said, “that owning a home gives me less flexibility if there’s an emergency, or a financial crisis.”'},\n",

       "   'content': \"The B-Roll\\n\\nDJI Osmo Action 4 Photograph: DJI\\n\\nSome of our previous picks remain good cameras, though their features lag behind more recent releases.\\n\\nDJI's Osmo Action 4 Camera for $299: The Action 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a fantastic action camera. The magnetic mounting system is the best we've tried, the menu system makes switching between modes a snap, and the resulting photos and video are great. The Action 5 trumps it in a number of ways, but if you're on a budget, this is an awesome camera and it integrates well into the DJI ecosystem.\\n\\nInsta360 ONE RS Twin Edition for $300: I loved the interchangeable lens system when this camera launched, but it's been two years since it was updated and feels a little like abandonware at this point. If you want 360 and action with the same camera, I recommend the Insta360 X4 above. It has better image quality, a better screen, and better battery life for not much more money.\\n\\nOclu Action Camera for $199: Oclu has a very different take on the action camera, eschewing the usual design for a flat body with the primary screen on top. The result is a camera that can fit places others won't—like the bottom of a skateboard. The Oclu shoots 4K at 30 fps or, if you want slo-mo footage, 1080p at 120 fps. The video and image quality is on par with what you get from the GoPro Hero 9. My gripe is the stabilization—it doesn't help nearly as much as what you get with others in this guide. Sound, on the other hand, is excellent; I got far less wind noise than with other cameras. All things considered, it's hard to beat the Oclu's performance for the price.\\n\\nAll those cheap cameras on Amazon: Readers often ask, why spend $400 on a GoPro when they can get a camera with 4K video for $100? It's a fair question, and the answer comes down to software, primarily image stabilization. Action cameras are designed to be strapped to helmets or clipped to your chest while you skydive, rock climb, and race through the city on a scooter. Without stabilization, the results are something even your closest friends won't sit through. So yes, you'll get 4K footage with the cheaper cams, but it'll be footage no one wants to see. In our view, you're better off spending another $100 for a GoPro Hero 11 or 12 on sale. The results won't be GoPro-caliber, but if you're just getting into action cams, this is a good way to test the waters.\\n\\nBest Accessories to Trick Out Your Camera\\n\\nGoPro Hero 12 Photograph: Scott Gilbertson\\n\\nOnce you have an action camera, you're good to go for most use cases. GoPro, Insta360, and DJI all provide helmet mounts and other ways to stick your camera where you want it. But there are some nice extras that can make getting that shot you're dreaming of even easier. Here are a few:\\n\\nA good microSD card: You may get an SD card with your camera. Insta360's SD cards are pretty good actually, but I tend to use SanDisk's Extreme Pro cards because they're fast and, as a bonus, waterproof. You can pick up a 512-GB card for around $60. I also like Samsung's Pro Plus microSD cards, which are a little faster in my tests. You can grab a 256-GB for around $60.\\n\\nGoPro Media Mod for $80: GoPro's sound is OK out of the box, but if you want higher-quality audio, this is where you start. Not because the Media Mod produces great sound—it's better than the camera, but still not great. What if offers is a microphone jack. Plug in a high-quality microphone and you'll finally have awesome sound. (Not recommended while skydiving.)\\n\\nJoby GorillaPod 3K for $70: This flexible tripod extends your action camera's mounting possibilities to include just about anything. My GoPro rarely leaves this tripod. It coils around SUP guys, tree branches, and even my dashboard. Be sure to grab some tripod adapters below.\\n\\nMotorcycle accessory bundle for $50: If you ride, this mount for the Insta360 X4 (and Ace Pro, etc) is a must-have. It's one of the most secure clamps I've ever used, almost as good as a bench vice.\\n\\nSametop tripod mount for $8: Action cameras offer many ways to mount them, but one that's curiously missing is the traditional quarter-inch tripod screw mount. The GoPro Hero 13 has one, but this four-pack of adapters solves the problem for the others.\\n\\nPolarizer and ND filters: If you shoot around water, through glass, or in any other high-glare situation, a polarizing filter will help cut that glare. Neutral density (ND) filters hold back light to let you shoot at a wider aperture in bright light. Both are great additions to your action camera kit. I've tested and like DJI's ND filter set for the Action 5 ($59). For the GoPro, I like Freewell's polarizing and ND filters ($20), or if you have the Hero 13 Black you can get the new GoPro ND filter Four-Pack ($70), which automatically adjusts the camera settings when attached. I suggest starting with an 8-stop ND or combo ND and polarizing filter.\\n\\nFloaty for $30: Another one for the water shooters, but well worth the money since it'll keep your GoPro from ending up at the bottom of the sea.\\n\\nSelfie stick for $25: I've tested a lot of selfie sticks and they're almost all fine, but I keep grabbing this Insta360 version when I head out the door. It's lightweight, small enough to fit at the bottom of my bag, and it's affordable. If you want to go big, this Insta360 Extended Edition Selfie Stick ($100) can imitate a low-flying drone, perfect for use in national parks and other places where drones are forbidden.\"},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-24T14:30:00',\n",
       "   'content': 'Over the course of 2024, Aella cried on 71 different days, showered on 24, and took ketamine on 14. We know this because she meticulously gathers and posts information about people’s personal, emotional, and sexual lives—including her own. The crying number was unusually high, she says, because of a bad breakup. For many fans, the more boggling statistic was that last year, she had sex on only 41 days, but on one of those days, she had sex with nearly 40 people. We’ll come back to that.\\n\\nAfter years of following Aella’s online outrages and unexpected insights, I wanted to meet her for myself—to understand her unusual occupation as a cam girl turned sex researcher, and to hear her perspective on what the internet has done to human sexuality. But my first IRL encounter with her, one day last spring, involved staring at a closed front door.\\n\\nAella had invited me to her home in Austin, but then slept through our designated appointment time. Even my frantic knocking and texting didn’t rouse her. Eventually, though, once she had woken up and been for a swim in the local springs, her assistant let me into the house and made me a mushroom coffee. Explaining that she was gradually bringing order to Aella’s life, the assistant opened a closet to reveal a rail of neatly hung bras. This was a first in my journalism career—being invited to appreciate an interviewee’s underwear. Not that Aella would mind, because her entire appeal is based around her lack of filter. Polaroids of her, masked and topless, were stuck to the fridge.\\n\\nJane Coaston: The nudes internet\\n\\n“I can’t really get canceled,” she told me when I finally met her, “because what are you gonna do?” By then she was sitting with her legs curled up underneath her on a chair, wearing only a robe and underwear, next to a giant, curved monitor of the type beloved by crypto day traders.\\n\\nAella is her longtime pseudonym; the 33-year-old keeps her birth name private. Describing precisely what she does for a living is difficult: Her X bio describes her as a “whorelord” and a “vexworker,” by which she means that she is an OnlyFans star, occasional escort, and organizer of sex parties. She is unabashedly a nerd, once describing herself as “a gremlinesque neckbeard who found himself in a hot woman’s body.” And she has turned her experience of selling sex into a large-scale research project.\\n\\nThanks to her talent for virality, she has been able to create huge online surveys that, despite the limitations of the medium, provide some of the broadest insights that we have into sexuality in the 2020s. More than 700,000 people have responded to her “Big Kink” survey. She has learned, among other things, that “pigtails” are a more popular fetish than “armpits.” She is as uninhibited about asking inflammatory questions as she is about posting nudes: She has written about whether penis size is correlated with race (“We haven’t had a good, high-n study”) and asked her followers if they would support the creation of realistic child-size sex dolls for pedophiles (77.4 percent said no).\\n\\nOne of the biggest problems in sex research is recruiting participants who can be induced to answer questions honestly. This is where Aella’s experience of capturing the internet’s attention gives her an advantage. The Big Kink survey takes about 40 minutes to complete—long enough to weed out trollish and spam responses. But how could she expect to keep unpaid respondents interested for that long? Her solution was to promise them a freakiness rating at the end, like a classic BuzzFeed personality quiz.\\n\\nJustin Garcia, an evolutionary biologist who serves as the executive director of the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, sees Aella as the young-Millennial version of Dr. Ruth Westheimer, the sex educator whose grandmotherly charm made her a disarming advocate of sexual liberation. As Dr. Ruth understood, many Americans’ lives were once blighted by their inability to articulate, much less confront, their relationship needs. Even today, people withhold details about their sexual interests from their partners, their doctors, and academic researchers. Yet they’ll spill quite a lot to a sex-positive internet personality, and all those revelations add up to a huge body of information.\\n\\nLike much American social-science research, Aella’s sample skews white and college-educated. Liberals are overrepresented in her data; most of her followers are men, but most of her survey respondents are women. Online polls like hers have limitations, Garcia told me. “But,” he added, “they do tell us what people are thinking about.”\\n\\nAella was raised in Idaho in a fundamentalist-Christian family that was so socially conservative, her parents showed her and her two younger sisters a censored version of Titanic. Her father is an evangelist and a radio host who used to be flooded by hate mail from atheists and other Christians. That turned out to be a preview of Aella’s own experience of threats and abuse, and good practice for life online. On a recent seven-and-a-half-hour episode of the podcast Whatever, she was part of a panel of 10 women who were hectored and mocked by Andrew Wilson, a fellow guest and self-described Christian “bloodsports debater.” When he insinuated that she didn’t understand science, she kept her cool and calmly explained basic statistical methods to him. His argumentative tactics, she said afterward, reminded her of her father’s.\\n\\nShe always felt like an outsider, she says now. She remembers writing in her teenage journals that “everybody else has access to a secret script that I don’t know what it is.” She left home at 17 after an argument. Once she started seeing flaws in her Christian beliefs, her faith crumbled quickly. “I have a tendency to take things to an extreme,” Aella once told Playboy. She flipped from devout teenager to libertine 20-something, barely passing through the dull span of vanilla dating and low-key Sunday churchgoing.\\n\\nAfter dropping out of college in northern Idaho, Aella became a cam girl—because streaming explicit content for money couldn’t be worse than her day job on an electrical-equipment assembly line, she reckoned. She both enjoyed and excelled at it, and she soon started researching what made some girls more successful than others. Her findings surprised her: Viewers liked idiosyncrasy and theatricality as much as nudity and straightforward hotness. And so she began to stage surreal scenes—dressing up as a mime, pretending to seduce a chair, doing a “dinosaur moonwalk,” playing the accordion. On an internet filled with horny nerds, the juxtaposition of weird and sexy can be lucrative. She earned more than $100,000 in her best month on OnlyFans, and has thousands of paid subscribers on Substack.\\n\\nHer first moment of virality outside the camming sites came in 2013, from a series of photos that showed her undressing, before being dragged off camera by garden gnomes. The “Getting Gnaked” set was viewed more than 2 million times within a year. Aella also found that, contrary to many of the stereotypes about online porn, a physically submissive woman was not what most straight men wanted. Instead, her customers fantasized about scenarios in which they were essentially passive—a “basic hot girl” just fell into their arms. “Like, Oh, we’re the last people on Earth, right?” she told the podcaster Lex Fridman. In a conclusion that might unsettle some feminists, she finds that the proportion of women who are interested in feeling submissive is greater than the proportion of men who want to feel dominant. Perhaps my favorite Aella claim is that she can arouse her escorting clients just by expressing enthusiasm as they explain high-level concepts to her. (Her current rate is $4,000 an hour.)\\n\\nDuring her early career, she bounced around the U.S., living in Boston, New York, and the Bay Area, as well as Portland, Oregon. She gravitated toward a scene known as rationalism, wherein self-professed nerds apply a coldly rational lens to subjects that are often clouded by emotion or dogma, such as the heritability of intelligence, whether you should altruistically donate a kidney to a stranger, and whether it’s acceptable to have sex with your sister. “once i threw a party for the bay area rationalists, and the rules to attend were you had to be wearing a full-face coverage mask, and be naked,” she wrote on X in 2021, during the pandemic. “Many came; they all bravely stripped, donned weird masks … and then proceeded to sit in a polite circle and debate global trade.” Her bracingly unfiltered posts put her in my peripheral vision years ago; while I am worried about the potential for abuse and exploitation in sex work, her originality and openness have always intrigued me.\\n\\nLast February, somewhat infamously, she enrolled 42 men to have sex with her en masse via a Google Form, then rented a venue, recruited eight women to act as fluffers, and asked the men to put on matching commemorative bathrobes. The resulting Substack post is a masterpiece, starting with an epigram from Nelson Mandela: “I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it.” (She detailed how two of the attendees, waiting in line, bonded over the fact that their start-ups had received support from the same venture-capital fund.) This was how she managed to have sex on so few days last year, but with so many different people. It is also one of many, many incidents in Aella’s life that most people would regard with awe, horror, or both.\\n\\nHelen Lewis: The outrage over 100 Men only goes so far\\n\\nAella originally felt drawn to sex research because her own sexual interests are outside the mainstream. She practices polyamory and freely discusses her fetish for “consensual nonconsent”—which is to say, scenarios in which she pretends to be taking part against her will. If she were “super normie” about sex, she told me, “I don’t think I would have the need to dissect it.” This places her in the grand tradition of American sex researchers who defied convention in their own personal life and, whether they acknowledged it or not, became advocates for greater sexual permissiveness. Alfred Kinsey, a pioneer in the field in the 1940s and ’50s, was married to a woman but had sexual relationships with at least one of his male students. The biologist shocked the country with his first book about human sexuality, which claimed that only half the population is exclusively heterosexual throughout adulthood. “I suspect that Kinsey’s great project originated in the discovery of his own sexual ambiguities,” the author of a 1972 Atlantic article hypothesized. Kinsey’s ostensibly objective scholarship was a concealed polemic: He wanted to expand the scope of “normal.”\\n\\nIn the 1960s, the gynecologist William Masters and and his research partner (and later wife) Virginia Johnson also defied prim scholarly norms by serving as consultants to Playboy, reasoning that the magazine was a good way to reach young men, and they supplied female “surrogates”—therapeutic escorts—to single men with sexual inhibitions, erectile disorder, and other conditions.\\n\\nThroughout the 20th century, sex researchers willed themselves to suspend moral judgment. Kinsey had a saying, Justin Garcia told me, that is often quoted at the institute that bears his name: “We are the recorders and reporters of facts—not the judges of the behaviors we describe.” Yet the field still has taboos, just different ones. The feminist commentators Catharine McKinnon and Andrea Dworkin, whose work is highly influential on university campuses, have argued that pornography is inherently harmful to women. Some of Aella’s findings challenge that view. She finds that men who watch online porn, rather than being desensitized to what real-life sexual partners want, are better at guessing what women want in bed.\\n\\nAella is not familiar with the academic traditions that have shaped modern sex research. When I asked her about Kinsey and Masters and Johnson, she told me that she hadn’t read their work. This irritates some mainstream researchers: J. Michael Bailey, a Northwestern University psychology professor who studies sexual orientation and arousal, told me he was “annoyed” by what he saw as her casualness, and denied being merely territorial. “She hasn’t bothered to learn things,” Bailey told me. “Sex research is not just asking a few questions to a lot of people. If it were, we would know a lot more than we know.”\\n\\nConor Friedersdorf: Don’t fire people for making pornography in their spare time\\n\\nNonetheless, Bailey said, “she talks about things without worry, and we should all be doing that a lot more.” He thinks that some mainstream academic sex research has suffered from “the encroachment of ideology,” becoming queer or feminist activism by other means. (Bailey’s 2003 book, The Man Who Would Be Queen, which argues that some gender transitions are sexually motivated, prompted some transgender activists to accuse him of research misconduct—claims that a subsequent investigation did not substantiate.) Bailey invited Aella to join an email discussion group he runs, and he asked her to promote a survey on sadomasochism that his graduate student was running. If he thought her work was worthless, he said, “I wouldn’t have asked for the help.”\\n\\nGarcia noted that, because sex research is a prime target for political scrutiny, institutions like his take great care with study design, researchers’ conflicts of interests, and gaining approval from review boards. “Aella, her work blurs those boundaries,” he told me. “But they were created by a field to protect itself, and add rigor and protection from political attacks.”\\n\\nUnconstrained by such concerns, Aella has spelunked through the extremes of modern sexuality. Among them is vore, a rare fetish “around swallowing someone whole or being swallowed whole, typically by a much larger creature,” as she put it. Researching the phenomenon is tricky. Trying to find, say, 300 people who like vore within the results of a bigger survey would require a huge initial number of respondents. Recruiting participants on a vore forum solves that problem, she has written, even if it does introduce some sampling bias: “Maybe these people are less ashamed about their fetish; maybe they’re lonelier in real life; maybe they’re much more into vore than the actual population of people into vore,” Aella argued. Or, of course, they could be lying.\\n\\nHelen Lewis: Nobody should care about a woman’s ‘body count’\\n\\nStill, as Aella and others have shown, the universe of niche sexual interests is enormous. And really, this is the big change that the internet has brought to sexuality itself—not just the study of it. Anyone who grew up with a latent vore fetish 100 years ago, or even 30, might have gone their whole life without meeting a fellow enthusiast for being swallowed whole. Bailey published research on people who both desire amputees and fantasize about becoming amputees. “What’s wonderful is that, today, people with these weird sexualities find each other online,” he told me. “It’s really a heyday for studying unusual phenomena like that.”\\n\\nThat raises some obvious follow-up questions: What if the internet is not just connecting people with weird sexual interests, but creating them? Should there ever be a time when sex researchers say, Hang on, that’s far enough?\\n\\nAella, who considers herself a libertarian, had come to Austin in the hope of meeting like-minded people, away from the default leftism of the Bay Area. But even in America’s supposed heterodoxy capital, she felt shunned. She joined an invitation-only society for freethinkers called Based in Austin, but was quickly kicked out of the group by fellow anti-woke warriors. Her offense was to post, in a chat thread about venue suggestions, a recommendation for a space where she had once held an orgy. She also didn’t last in a support group for OnlyFans creators, because other women—who she said were “very, very, like, social justice, very leftist”—objected to her provocative posts.\\n\\nAella thinks that America still has a deeply hypocritical attitude to sex. “It feels like we simultaneously have a culture where we say sexual liberalism is good, but in action, we find reasons to not allow individual expression to happen,” she told me when I caught up with her again over Zoom, a few months after my visit to Austin. She cited PornHub’s refusal to host videos of sleep fetishes. But there was a good reason for that policy, I said—the trial of Dominique Pelicot and 50 other French men revealed that Pelicot had recruited men to rape his unconscious wife under the pretext that the couple were indulging a consensual fetish about “sleeping beauties.”\\n\\nMy main point of disagreement with Aella is that she has a much sunnier vision of human nature than I do. While some people do like consensual nonconsent, others clearly relish actual violation and sadism in and out of the bedroom. Aella’s blitheness about the risks of her job—she wrote a guide to escorting, in which she describes one client aggressively biting and choking her—seems to be born from the same off-kilter approach to life that makes her such a good amateur anthropologist. In Austin, I was surprised that she invited me, a total stranger, to meet her at home. Eighteen months earlier, a man had appeared at her door and attempted to kidnap her. (Police later found a garrote at his home, alongside a knife, duct tape, and the names of two other sex workers. The man took a plea deal and is already out of jail.)\\n\\nHelen Lewis: How Joe Rogan remade Austin\\n\\nUltimately, she left the Texas capital after a different episode of personal turmoil. She had hoped to have children, only to discover in August that her primary partner wasn’t interested in starting a family. When she revealed the breakup online, a predictable storm of schadenfreude ensued. For “posting publicly about being devastated from a breakup,” she wrote on X, her reward was “people laughing how you deserved it.”\\n\\nShe packed up her belongings and moved back to California. Her new housemate is one of the fluffers from her orgy—a woman who was also dating Aella’s boyfriend but broke up with him too, in solidarity. “We were both dating my ex, and then we’re both not dating him,” she told me. With her living arrangements sorted, Aella wants to work on a book and co-author some scientific papers, both of which might allow her to gain the respectability she needs to attract more funding. She might seek out what she calls “performative credentials.”\\n\\nIn the meantime, though, she still embraces the queasily intimate dynamics of internet celebrity—an openness that provides rich fodder for cruel armchair psychologists. Isn’t she just getting back at Daddy? How will she ever find love? I find something endearing about her refusal to be bowed by this kind of jeering. Aella bravely voyages to the frontiers of American sexuality, collecting data on people’s darkest desires, uncovering the hidden economics of the online sex trade, and refusing—despite all the mockery—to filter herself.'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-20T13:00:00',\n",
       "   'content': 'It is a basic fact of American life, so widely known that it hardly needs to be said: College is getting ever more unaffordable. In survey after survey, Americans say that the cost of getting a degree just keeps rising.\\n\\nBut this basic fact of life is not a fact at all. In reality, Americans are paying less for college, on average, than they were a decade ago. Since the 2014–15 school year, the cost of attending a public four-year university has fallen by 21 percent, before adjusting for inflation, according to College Board data analyzed by Judith Scott-Clayton, a professor of economics and education at Columbia University’s Teachers College. (Nearly three-quarters of American college students attend a public institution.) The cost of attending a private university has risen in raw terms over the same time period, but is down 12 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars. Once tax benefits are factored in, according to a recent Brookings Institution analysis, the average American is paying the same amount for tuition as they were in the 1990s. “People have it in their heads that prices just keep going up, up, up,” Sandy Baum, a nonresident senior fellow at the Urban Institute, told me. “And that’s actually not what’s happening.”\\n\\nThe confusion comes from the idiosyncratic way in which college is priced. Schools set a staggering official price that only a subset of the wealthiest students pay in full. Universities rely on that money to offer financial aid to low-income students; in effect, rich families subsidize the cost of attendance for everyone else. This means that there’s often a chasm between the published cost of attendance, or sticker price, and what people actually pay once financial aid is factored in, or the net price. Unfortunately, the eye-popping sticker prices tend to get the most attention. Within higher-education reporting, articles anticipating the arrival of the $100,000 year of college have become practically a genre unto themselves. “There’s massive problems in the higher-education sector—and we focus on all the wrong ones,” Phillip Levine, an economics professor at Wellesley College, told me. “We can’t stand the fact that the sticker price is so high despite the fact that nobody pays it.”\\n\\nThis pricing strategy took hold in the early 1980s. Since then, Levine has found, the sticker cost of attending a four-year public or private university—tuition plus fees and room and board—has almost tripled after adjusting for inflation. (The past four years, during which pandemic-induced inflation outpaced tuition growth, are an exception to the trend.) With this pace of increase, it’s no wonder that people think college prices are out of control.\\n\\nRose Horowitch: The perverse consequences of tuition-free medical school\\n\\nBut, as sticker prices have soared, so has the gap between them and the amount that people actually pay. The effect is most pronounced for low-income families, but middle- and upper-middle-income families receive substantial discounts too. In the 2021–22 school year, 82 percent of first-time, full-time undergraduates at public four-year schools received aid, as did 87 percent of those at private institutions. Only students whose families make more than about $300,000 a year and who attend private institutions with very large endowments pay more than they did a decade ago, Levine said.\\n\\nHigher education might not be cheap—many families still get far less financial aid than they need, and the cost of attendance can rise unpredictably from year to year—but it is clearly getting cheaper. A mix of factors appear to be behind the trend. Increases to the federal Pell Grant have limited out-of-pocket costs for low-income students, David Deming, a political-economy professor at Harvard, told me. State appropriations have rebounded for public universities since the Great Recession. And colleges themselves appear to be offering more aid, which accounts for 70 percent of all discounts, Adam Looney, an economist at the University of Utah who wrote the Brookings study, told me.\\n\\nMost of the researchers I spoke with predicted that net prices would keep falling over the next few years. The number of 18-year-old high-school graduates is expected to peak this year, followed by a long decline. This will reduce demand for college and force institutions to compete even harder with one another for applicants.\\n\\nCollege is getting more affordable: That’s the good news. The bad news is that no one seems to have heard the good news. Nearly half of all adults in the U.S. think that universities charge everyone the same amount, according to a 2023 survey by the Association of American Universities. And, even as college costs fall, a recent poll found that 44 percent of people think that their state’s public-college tuition is likely to increase in the next year. (Twelve percent thought it would decrease, and the rest predicted no change.)\\n\\nOne study found that most high-achieving, low-income students chose not to apply to highly selective colleges with steep sticker prices. They opted instead for schools with lower sticker prices that ended up offering much less financial aid and thus costing more. (For low-income students who are admitted, elite universities, which draw on their enormous wealth to offer generous need-based aid, are almost always the most affordable option.) Another study found that low-income students were less likely to apply to a school when it raised its sticker price, even if those students would have qualified for a full ride based on their financial need. More unfortunate still, sticker shock can lead students to forgo college entirely.\\n\\nIn recent years, public confidence in higher education has fallen sharply; researchers attribute much of the decline to perceptions of college costs. More and more Americans are saying that a degree isn’t worth the investment, even though the so-called college wage premium still far outstrips the cost of attendance.\\n\\nDavid Deming: The college backlash is going too far\\n\\nWhen researchers tell people how much more they stand to earn if they graduate from college, their study subjects are more likely to apply. Clearly, colleges should do a better job advertising their value proposition, even as they stress that most people don’t pay the full sticker price. But, given the opacity of the system, just telling people the difference between sticker and net prices has been shown to have little effect on whether those people attend college. Some research suggests that it would be more effective for schools to commit up front to one price for the full four years, something they are loath to do. “You have to fix knowledge, but then also make some promises to students that, not only is this real, but we’re not going to switch up on you after a year or two—which, to be frank, many universities currently do,” Zach Bleemer, an economics professor at Princeton, told me.\\n\\nAs colleges prepare for a tough enrollment picture, they can’t afford to push students away. And yet higher education’s weird pricing model is probably not going anywhere. After all, colleges haven’t found a better way to get the funding they need for financial aid. “I remember 30 years ago, people saying: ‘This can’t go on. They can’t keep doing this,’” Baum, the Urban Institute fellow, told me. “And they do. And they have to because if you charged everybody the same price, that price would simply be too high for many people.” In other words, it might not be long before we’re hearing about the rise of the $110,000 year of college—even as students are paying less than they do today.'},\n",

I had ordered a fertility test online that said it would provide fast results with just a few drops of blood. The videos on the company’s website featured a smiling blond woman jumping—to stimulate blood flow, naturally—and then effortlessly dribbling blood from her fingertips all over a little strip of test paper. All I had to do was be like her. Joyful. Sanguineous. Fertile.\\n\\nExplore the March 2025 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More\\n\\nFor years, my husband, Rich, and I had gingerly walked the prime meridian between wanting and not wanting kids, usually leaning toward the “no” side. Having a baby had seemed unaffordable and impossible. On days when I finished work at 8 p.m., the thought of procreating made me laugh, then shudder.\\n\\nRecently, though, I’d begun to reconsider. I was in the midst of an admittedly strange-sounding project: I was spending a year trying to change my personality. According to a scientific personality test I’d taken, I scored sky-high on neuroticism, a trait associated with anxiety and depression, and low on agreeableness and extroversion. I lived in a constant, clenched state of dread, and it was poisoning my life. My therapist had stopped laughing at my jokes.\\n\\nBut I had read some scientific research suggesting that you can change your personality by behaving like the kind of person you wish you were. Several studies show that people who want to be, say, less isolated or less anxious can make a habit of socializing, meditating, or journaling. Eventually these habits will come naturally, knitting together to form new traits.\\n\\nFrom the March 2022 issue: I gave myself three months to change my personality\\n\\nI knew that becoming a parent had the potential to change me in even more profound ways. But I had no idea how. My own mother once said to me, “I can’t picture you as a mother.” The truth was, neither could I.\\n\\nI wasn’t sure I could get pregnant, even if I wanted to. My age put me in a category that was, in a less delicate time, called “geriatric” for pregnancy, and one doctor told me my eggs were probably of “poor quality.” The fertility test I’d ordered was meant to determine if those eggs were serviceable. In the bathroom, I unwrapped the glossy white box. The instructions said the test would take 20 minutes and require a pack of lancets. I grabbed one and stabbed it into my geriatric forefinger. Two hours, five lancets, and a graveyard of gauze and alcohol wipes later, I still hadn’t squeezed a single droplet out of my finger. Was I not jumping high enough? Was I already failing as a mother?\\n\\nI was worried I wouldn’t be able to have a baby. I was also scared to death of having one.\\n\\nArguably, many things are wrong with me. I was raised by Russian immigrants who constantly worried that the “dark day” was upon us, so hopeful thoughts about the future of humanity don’t come naturally. I’m not a person who is affected by cuteness. I’ve never liked holding—or even really looking at—other people’s babies. I don’t like animals. I couldn’t imagine cooing and smiling at a baby as much as science says you’re supposed to for their brain development.\\n\\nMy neuroticism made it especially hard to decide if I wanted kids, because no process is more rife with uncertainty than parenting, and nothing scares anxious people more than uncertainty. I worried that Rich and I would fight more, and that our relationship would suffer. I worried about sleep deprivation. I felt torn between my lifelong conviction that people shouldn’t create problems for themselves and my (apparent) desire to do just that.\\n\\nI would wake up in the middle of the night and Google things like percent miscarriage pregnant while 36? ; anxiety pregnancy miscarriage causes; Diet Coke fetal defects; pregnancy brain stops working hands stop working. These searches surfaced horrific anecdotes, but never any conclusive answers about what I should do. One time, I Googled reasons to have kids and found an article that labeled all the reasons I had come up with—like being cared for in old age and having someone who loves me—with the heading “Not-So-Good Reasons to Have Children.”\\n\\nBut then I would remember the times we visited Rich’s mom, who had dementia, in her nursing home. Her face lit up at the sight of him. “My son, my son, my only son,” she’d say, grabbing his arm. He was the only person she still recognized. The visits were a reminder that the people who matter most at the end are your children. The readers of your blog posts won’t make the trip.\\n\\nHeather Rackin, a sociologist at Louisiana State University, found in a study that the death of a mother or sibling increased the likelihood that a woman would give birth within two years. The proximity of death is, perhaps, a wake-up call. Who will remember us? The study was based on Rackin’s personal experience: When her father died in 2017, she decided not to wait any longer to have kids. His death got her thinking, she told me, about what was important in life: the experience of being loved and the chance to provide that love for someone else. Her first child was born in 2019.\\n\\nThere are many reasons to postpone or avoid having children—the cost, the responsibility, the existence of and use case for the NoseFrida. But in addition to the practical challenges, a narrative has taken hold: Everything changes when you become a mother.\\n\\nOnce they reach their 30s, many people have carefully cultivated friend groups and sourdough starters and five-year plans. They “really have a good sense of who they are, and then having a baby totally disrupts everything that they thought they knew about themselves,” says Lauren Ratliff, a perinatal therapist in Illinois. Of course, this is where I differ from the rest of my cohort. By the time I was ready to have a baby, I’d already been trying to disrupt everything about myself.\\n\\nFor my personality-change project, I had experimented with science-backed strategies to turn down my neuroticism and amp up my extroversion and agreeableness. I had spent hundreds of hours trying out different iterations of mindfulness, culminating in a day-long meditation retreat that almost killed me with boredom but somehow alleviated my depression. Among other agreeableness-boosting activities, I traveled to London for a “conversation workshop,” where I learned techniques that can make even British people show an emotion. And to become more extroverted, I went out as much as humanly possible. I played table tennis. I did improv, and survived.\\n\\nBeing pregnant means having your brain replaced with an anxiety T-shirt cannon. I didn’t feel glowy or goddessy; I felt crazy.\\n\\nFor the most part, my efforts worked: I no longer thought of talking with people as a waste of time. I became less afraid of uncertainty and disappointment. I made one very good new friend. I drank less.\\n\\nListen: How to Start Over, a podcast with Olga Khazan on navigating the challenges of changing your life\\n\\nI had been changing, but it was a type of change that I directly determined. I could go to happy hour, or not. I could meditate, or stop. I was aware that parenthood would transform me further, but what I found unsettling was that I couldn’t know exactly how. Bizarrely, for the biggest disruption of your life, study after study shows there’s no “typical” way that becoming a parent changes your personality. Some studies have found tiny average decreases in extroversion or openness among new parents—but even those findings aren’t consistent.\\n\\nDespite my progress, I was still too neurotic to feel comfortable surrendering control and letting biology mold me into someone I couldn’t predict and might not recognize.\\n\\nAfter doctors pronounced me insufficiently fertile, Rich and I decided to just stop being careful one month and see what happened. We figured we would at least have some fun before we embarked on our arduous “fertility journey.”\\n\\nA short time later, on a choppy boat tour in Europe, I couldn’t stop leaning over the edge of the catamaran and hurling.\\n\\n“Do you think you might be pregnant?” Rich whispered as the boat crew force-fed me pita bread.\\n\\n“Don’t be insane,” I said. Everyone knows that 37-year-olds—especially infertile ones—don’t get pregnant on their first try.\\n\\nA week after that, I found out that I had indeed gotten pregnant on my first try.\\n\\nBeing pregnant means having your brain replaced with an anxiety T-shirt cannon. I didn’t feel glowy or goddessy; I felt crazy. None of my friends has kids, and many of them reacted to my news like I’d gotten a face tattoo. One sent me a TikTok of everything that can supposedly go wrong in pregnancy, including the possibility that vomit will come out of your eyes. (It won’t.) I spent more and more time by myself, obsessing over which swaddles were best. (We didn’t end up using any.)\\n\\nLife events like parenthood seem to change everyone differently, and how you’ll change is, in part, up to you.\\n\\nThanks to a king tide of hormones, irritability spikes during the first and last trimesters of pregnancy. People say your baby will remember the sounds they hear in the womb, but I fear mine detected little in there other than me screaming at his father. Every few weeks, something would set me off, at a deafening volume. If they’d overheard me, those couples therapists who say contempt is the most glaring sign of a failed relationship would probably have advised us to start divvying up our furniture.\\n\\nOlga Khazan: Doomed to be a tradwife\\n\\nSometimes when I was yelling, being so mean felt amazing—as though I’d finally engulfed Rich in my distress. Obviously you need a travel stroller and a regular stroller! I always apologized, and Rich always accepted my apology. But one time he said, “You know that with a kid, that’s not really something you can take back, right?” Sometimes, late at night, after yet another argument, I would rotate my spheroid belly toward Rich and ask, “What if I turn out to be a bad mother?”\\n\\nThe rest of the pregnancy was horrible. I didn’t think it was possible to feel so tired and still be technically alive. At my baby shower, when some friends asked me how I was feeling, I quoted the Russian dissident Boris Nadezhdin responding to a question about whether he feared imprisonment or death: “The tastiest and the sweetest years of my life are already in the past.” (This is the closest Russians get to excited.)\\n\\nThree weeks before my due date, after a routine ultrasound, my high-risk ob-gyn walked briskly into the room. She looked around for something to sit on and, finding nothing, plopped down on top of a closed trash can. She told me that something was wrong with my placenta, and that the baby was in danger. And that I should now walk over to the delivery wing of the hospital.\\n\\nKimberly Elliott\\n\\nIn the antechamber of the operating room, I hyperventilated in my paper gown and tapped out emails to all my sources and bosses: I’m having an emergency C-section today, so I won’t be available for the next few months. My last day of caring whether people were mad at me.\\n\\nAfterward, while the medical residents were rearranging my innards, I thought I heard one of them ask me something.\\n\\n“I’m sorry, I don’t know what’s going on down there at all,” I said across the blue curtain.\\n\\n“That’s … probably for the best,” the resident said.\\n\\nHe came out with white hair, a perfectly round face, and a grumpy expression, like the leader of a former Yugoslav republic. I called him “Slobodan” a couple of times, until Rich told me to stop.\\n\\nBecause he was early, we panic-picked a name from our shortlist—Evan. The same day he was born, doctors whisked him away to the NICU; I saw him only a few times before we were all sent home days later. My discharge paperwork said, “Mom is breastfeeding four or five times a day,” which was funny because at that point I had not done it successfully even once. It was also funny because I—quite possibly the least qualified person for the job—was apparently “Mom.”\\n\\nOnce home, we entered the period we now refer to as “Cute Abu Ghraib.” Sleep deprivation addled me to the point that, on a call with the pediatrician, I forgot the baby’s name. When Evan was two weeks old, I bit into a piece of chicken and tasted something bloody and sharp. I had ground my teeth so hard during his NICU stay that I’d loosened a crown.\\n\\nWe agonized over whether the gyrations of the SNOO Smart Sleeper Bassinet would rattle his brain too much, then grew too exhausted to care. I became the CEO of Baby Inc., and Rich was employee No. 1; we communicated only about ointments and ounces. I finally had the big boobs of my dreams, but the only man who saw them was two feet tall and couldn’t read.\\n\\nBut then something interrupted the misery. One night, I was holding Evan while he was sleeping. I had read that singing to your baby was beneficial, so I decided to serenade him with one of the few songs I know by heart: “Forever and Ever, Amen,” by Randy Travis. Except I couldn’t seem to get through the fourth line: “This love that I feel for you always will be.” I, a bad bitch who has never cried at a wedding, kept choking up.\\n\\nRich asked me if I was okay.\\n\\n“Whatever!” I said, tears rolling down my cheeks. “Shut up!”\\n\\nI thought motherhood would be a forced march through inert babyhood and feral toddler years before we finally reached the golden time of my imagination: having a talking, precocious elementary schooler. But there I was, flooded with adoration for someone who barely registered my presence. I’d hated being pregnant, so I thought I would hate having a baby, too. But I loved him. I loved this.\\n\\nRecall the research showing there’s no one way that parenthood tends to change people’s personalities. Anecdotally, researchers told me that they do notice certain patterns among new parents. Most moms worry about their kid, more or less constantly, from the minute they find out they’re pregnant. “Signing up to be a parent is signing up to have a lifetime of some degree of depression and anxiety,” Ratliff, the therapist, told me.\\n\\nOlga Khazan: Why it’s so hard to know what to do with your baby\\n\\nNew parents’ satisfaction with their romantic relationship goes down, especially for mothers, and especially in the first year. “Guilt is another universal,” says Aurélie Athan, a clinical psychologist at Columbia University’s Teachers College, who researches the transition known as “matrescence.” The creeping sense that you should be with your kid while you’re working and working while you’re with your kid apparently never goes away.\\n\\nShe told me that mothers become more attuned and prosocial—more caring and empathetic toward others. Athan said this is why so many mothers cry when their babies cry and have a hard time watching gory movies. “Moms get a really bad taste in their mouth with violent television or looking at images of war,” she said.\\n\\nThat’s where she lost me. My son had colic; for the first four months, he screamed like the possessed unless he was within the jiggly confines of his SNOO. The doula we hired referred to him, alternately, as “Mr. Cheeks,” “Mr. Crab,” and, sarcastically, “Mr. Wonderful.” If I had cried every time he cried, I wouldn’t have had time to do anything else.\\n\\nHaving a baby won’t make you a better person. Behaving like a better person for your baby will.\\n\\nEventually, Rich and I grew desensitized, or felt like we had to match his chaotic energy with equally intense stimuli. One night, after Evan wailed in our ears for two hours, we shuffled downstairs and collapsed onto the couch. There was only one thing we could think to watch that would serve as a comedown from what had just happened: Saving Private Ryan.\\n\\n“Did you remember to sterilize the pump parts?” I asked Rich as the entrails of American soldiers spilled out over the beaches of Normandy.\\n\\n“The sterilizer thing broke, so I had to reset it,” he said as a man stumbled around with his arm blown off.\\n\\nEven within these supposedly universal rules of parenthood, that is, there’s a lot of variability. That’s because life events like parenthood seem to change everyone differently, and how you’ll change is, in part, up to you. For a recent study, Ted Schwaba, a psychologist at Michigan State University, and his co-authors asked thousands of Dutch people about a life event in the past 10 years, such as a divorce or a new job, that they felt had changed who they were as a person. About 7 percent of the participants identified parenthood as the event that changed them, and on average, they felt that it had made them slightly more agreeable and conscientious.\\n\\nBut the big takeaway for Schwaba, from looking at all the data for all the different types of life events, was that there really was no pattern. Some people became more extroverted when they got a new job. Some became less so. Some people actually became less neurotic—that is, less depressed and anxious—after, say, a cancer diagnosis.\\n\\nTo Schwaba, this research suggests that it’s how you experience an event such as parenthood, more than the event itself, that determines how you’ll change. “The same event, like getting divorced, might be someone’s worst thing that’s ever happened to them, and for someone else, it might be the best thing that’s ever happened to them,” he told me.\\n\\nOr your personality might change not immediately after an event like childbirth, but through a long process that the event sets in motion. It’s not the cry you hear in the delivery room that changes you; it’s the many years of researching child care and soothing boo-boos that gradually turn you into someone new. To change, you have to take steps every day to do so. Having a baby won’t make you a better person. Behaving like a better person for your baby will.\\n\\nOf all the things I wanted motherhood to change about me, neuroticism was high on the list. Before I had Evan, I felt like I was personally responsible for making life unfold perfectly, and whenever I “failed” to do so, I had a meltdown. One day a few years ago, I got a bad haircut, got stuck in traffic, and had professional photos taken that looked terrible. My response to this—what my new-parent eyes now see as an 8-out-of-10 day—was to chug half a bottle of wine and scream to my husband through sobs, “I hate everyone and everything!”\\n\\nOlga Khazan: This influencer says you can’t parent too gently\\n\\nBut now so much goes wrong every single day that there’s no time to get upset about any one thing. I recently took a flight with Evan by myself, an exercise that really underscores the first Noble Truth of Buddhism (life is suffering). As I hauled the car seat, the stroller, the baby, the diaper bag, and the trendy, impractical tote from my childless years to the TSA line, an airline attendant took one look at me and said, “I know; it is too much.”\\n\\nIn the middle of the flight, I noticed that the two bottles of formula Evan nervously drank during takeoff had caught up with him, and that he was now soaked with pee. I grabbed him under the armpits and scooted across the seats to change him in the airplane’s postage-stamp-size bathroom. With one hand, I held him, crying, on the changing table, and with the other, I dug a clean onesie out of the bottom of the diaper bag. I fastened a million tiny onesie buttons. Then I saw that I had misaligned them and fastened them again. Next it was my turn. I couldn’t leave him on the changing table, or put him on the disgusting floor. I yanked my leggings down and held him at arm’s length as I peed.\\n\\nBy the end of that ordeal, I felt accomplished and capable. I didn’t feel like sobbing; I felt like high-fiving myself. I’ve let go in other ways, too. I show up at important meetings without makeup on. I say weird stuff to strangers and don’t analyze it obsessively later. Evan has forced me to step outside myself, to break from the relentless self-focus that has contributed to both my success and my unhappiness.\\n\\nMy remaining neuroses are laser-directed on his well-being. I had initially planned not to breastfeed, but once I started, I got so into it that when a doctor suggested that Evan would spit up less if I cut food allergens from my diet, I stopped eating virtually anything but oats and spinach for months. When I was pregnant, we’d signed the unborn Evan up for day care, but as the end of my maternity leave loomed, I embarked on a frantic search for a nanny so he could stay close to me while I worked from home. I had always mentally mocked parents who checked to be sure their babies were still breathing at night, then found myself standing in front of his crib at 3 a.m., feeling for puffs of air from two tiny nostrils.\\n\\nKimberly Elliott\\n\\nI yell at Rich less than I used to, because not only is he employee No. 1 of Baby Inc., but he’s the only employee, and frankly there are no other applicants for the job. In fact, the whole experience has made me kinder and more tender, like the Grinch, post–heart enlargement. I’m less worried about wasting time, because all time with a baby is essentially wasted—the most important nothing you’ll ever do in your life. I even love Evan’s wet, violent “kisses,” which leave his baby-teeth imprints on our jaws. When my friend Anton visited recently, he watched me make horsey noises for Evan for what probably felt like hours. “I can’t believe you love an infant!” he said.\\n\\nDuring my interview with Ratliff, I told her that Evan had lately been losing interest in breastfeeding. I had awaited this day through months of bleeding nipples and frustration, but now that it was here, it was making me a bit sad. “Your baby’s moving to the next stage,” she affirmed, “and this one is not going to come back again.” I started tearing up—both at the memory of those bleary, milk-soaked months together and at the realization that he wouldn’t even be a baby for much longer.\\n\\nDuring my personality-change experiment, my meditation teacher had tried to hammer home the idea that “this too shall pass” is both uplifting and sad: Nothing bad lasts forever, but neither does anything good. Before I had Evan, I was focused on impermanence’s upsides: This uncomfortable improv show will end; this awful pregnancy will too. But now I’m more keenly aware of its downsides. The sleepless nights will end, but so too will the times Evan squeals at a game of peekaboo, or spends an entire swim class gazing up at me in awe. Every day brings a sigh of relief and a pang of nostalgia. Having someone who loves you, I’ve decided, is a good reason to have kids.\\n\\nThis essay was adapted from Olga Khazan’s forthcoming book, Me, but Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change.

       "   'content': 'For many, budgeting has never felt like more of a challenge, which might explain why it seems to be trendier than ever — with all the fads and judgment that attention implies. TikTok influencers offer financial trendbait like “loud budgeting” and the “100 envelope challenge,” which suggest that people can solve their financial problems by following strict rules that can be summed up in a single viral hashtag.\\n\\nDana Miranda is a personal finance journalist and educator based in central Wisconsin who runs the Healthy Rich newsletter and is the author of You Don’t Need a Budget. Jen Smith and Jill Sirianni are based in St. Petersburg, Florida, where they co-host the Frugal Friends Podcast and co-authored Buy What You Love Without Going Broke. These three financial educators believe that budgeting culture has gone to the kinds of extremes that make it difficult to think holistically about financial values — and that the best way to manage money might involve letting go of some of the so-called rules.\\n\\nThe following conversation has been lightly condensed and edited.\\n\\nJen Smith: I think that we’ve learned a lot of our budgeting, and our financial habits and consumption, from the way we consume food. We’ve taken something we’re already familiar with, extreme diets, and transitioned it to money. For women, it’s been this constant source of shame and struggle — and so we really want to get away from the language that causes this shame and struggle and create a new way to think about financial concepts that are a little more freeing and empowering.\\n\\nDana Miranda: I specifically thought it was important to name budget culture and to show the direct parallel to diet culture. The ways we talk about money are focused on that same restrictive mindset. It’s also a very individualistic mindset, when both our approach to food and our approach to money have so many systemic causes and implications that we often don’t talk about when we’re giving financial advice.\\n\\nOnce we understand the ways we teach and talk about money in our culture, we can understand that even if we’re not specifically engaging in restrictive budgeting, that kind of culture underlies all of the ways we think about money.\\n\\nJill Sirianni: I think a lot of us are not taught how to manage our resources well. We’re not taught how to spend, we’re not taught how to save, much less how to invest. It’s not usually overtly taught by our parents or caregivers, and it’s not taught in school — so we graduate and take on student loan debt, not really understanding what that means for us in the long term.\\n\\nWe also learn that spending is a personality trait. You’re either a spender or a saver. We should be learning that we all spend, and we all should be saving, and there shouldn’t be this guilt or shame attached to any of it. We can align our spending with the things that actually matter; our values, the things that are important and life-giving to us. This gives us a sense of confidence and freedom about the ways we spend our money — or ways we don’t spend our money, if we choose to consume less.\\n\\nJen: Spending was a hobby when I was growing up. It’s what we did on the weekend! We went to the mall. We went to Walmart. That was how I learned what to do with money. I didn’t learn how to spend it on investments. I didn’t learn how to spend it on vacations after saving up for them. I wasn’t taught any of that.\\n\\nNow shopping isn’t just a hobby. It’s what you do when you’re stressed! It’s what you do when you’re bored! It’s the go-to thing to do with any free given second of time.\\n\\nDana: That’s interesting, because I was raised just the opposite. I grew up in a culture that was anti-debt, anti-spending, pro-saving. Hold on to money as much as you can and work hard to earn it. That’s what I see in people as adults, too — sometimes they’re afraid to spend money, because they’ve been told their whole life that spending money leads to chaos.\\n\\nWe’re never taught to question what’s going on outside of us, and we’re never taught to look inside of ourselves and ask ourselves what we want to do with our money.\\n\\nJill: For our book, we really wanted to teach the skill of spending. It’s not a personality trait, it’s not a moral failing or a moral superiority, it’s a skill. That means it’s something you can learn and something you can get better at doing.\\n\\nStopping all spending and doing something like a no-buy year, we don’t think that’s the answer. A short no-spend challenge can show us something about our spending habits and speed up the timeline of learning — but if you want to learn how to function in the world that we live in, you’re going to spend money. Let’s hone that skill and do it well!\\n\\nDana: Your book is such a complement to mine that I’m starting to recommend them together. My book focuses on the cultural relationship with money and the personal relationship with money. What I really want people to take away from my book is to start to question the traditional advice that they’re hearing, because I think that’s the big skill we’re not learning. We’re looking for a specific set of rules or a specific method, and we end up bouncing from method to method to try to find the right one instead of asking questions about why this person is describing this particular method. Why is this person giving this particular advice? What about their life made that method work for them, and how might that be different from what’s in my life — or how might it be the same? That’s how people can start piecing together something that works for them, and how they can start questioning what’s around them instead of asking someone else to tell them what to do next.\\n\\nI use my book to shift people into that mindset, but I like to recommend your book because it gives people the practical tips that can help them take the next steps.\\n\\nJill: Our approach is similar to Dana’s approach: understanding ourselves first. We need to understand some of the reasoning behind what we’re doing so that we can have self-understanding, and a lot of that involves giving people tools that they can take with them throughout any season of life.\\n\\nWhen that happens, when we understand what our current spending habits are and learn the ways in which we want to shift them, how we can get more of what really matters, our values, our higher needs; then we can identify what we want to do with our resources. That’s all of our resources: our time, our physical space, our relationships, our mental and emotional energies, as well as our money.\\n\\nSo with something like investing — and of course that’s a whole large topic, there are plenty of books just on that topic — we believe that it requires these first steps in order to build a really solid foundation so that people can determine what the best investment strategy might be for them going forward.\\n\\nFor many people who are middle or average earners, the best strategy is probably going to be some kind of automation utilizing your Roth IRA and your 401(k), but a lot of times people in this space are still looking at debt payoff and fully funding an emergency fund. These are the types of things they can set on autopilot so they can begin saving for retirement, but first we need to understand the skill of spending. What do I even value? How can I get more of what I want without throwing money at my problems?\\n\\nJen: There are already plenty of great investment books out there. Rich AF by Vivian Tu, Grow Your Money by Bola Sokunbi, but it is very hard to take action on them if you are spending every dollar you make. The lowest barrier to entry to get started with investing is to spend less. Our book can help people increase their margin so they can start investing faster. They don’t have to wait to earn more.\\n\\nDana: In You Don’t Need a Budget, I try to speak to people who might be experiencing financial insecurity or some instability, but the issue with that is that most of the time if someone is experiencing something like food insecurity, it is usually the result of a systemic cultural problem and not something that we can offer personal advice to help them change. It’s something that needs to be addressed at a systemic level.\\n\\nWhat I try to do for readers in that situation is to reiterate that message over and over, because often in the personal finance space they’re getting messages written for people who are middle or average income. They’re getting tweaks on how to spend their money, which is just not enough — so the message I want to send is that this information is not for you. People are not speaking to your situation, and you should not feel ashamed of the things that you have to do to survive in this system that is not allowing you that kind of security.\\n\\nIt’s hard as a financial educator and personal finance writer to speak to that situation, because there’s no answer for it. It’s a systemic thing and a political thing, and it’s important to say that.\\n\\nJen: We also believe that debt is neutral. Some people consider a mortgage “good debt,” and for other people their mortgage can be 50 percent of their income — which doesn’t make mortgages bad, but in this case it might not be the best decision for you.\\n\\nCredit card debt and high interest debt can be a bad decision, but not always. Sometimes you need those tools to keep you afloat. I often like to say that there’s a difference between being hungry and not knowing where your next meal is coming from. A person who is using credit cards to deal with food insecurity is different from a person who is maximizing every line of credit available to them and not dealing with their long-term financial goals.\\n\\nThat said, if you are in credit card debt, get rid of that debt first. That’s something I’m willing to take a stand on. For everything else, you have to honor your season and your capacity for what you can do financially.\\n\\nDana: I really think that’s the approach we need to take to debt. It’s about your season. I take a radical approach in terms of allowing the use of debt, but I also want people to understand how debt products work.\\n\\nI don’t think that anybody has a moral obligation to pay off debt as quickly as possible, the way that it is sometimes represented. I think that debt products are a resource to help you live a life that’s comfortable and have the experiences that you want and deserve. As long as you understand how debt works and how to deal with any debt you accrue, you can go ahead and use debt products in your life.\\n\\nIt’s important to avoid actions such as maxing out your credit card or damaging your credit score — the kind of things that might reduce your access to debt as a resource — but you should also avoid thinking of debt in terms of rules, such as “it’s a rule that we should avoid debt” or “it’s a rule that we should pay off debt as quickly as possible.”\\n\\nJill: One of the reframes we’ve used on debt is the idea of “beneficial” versus “not beneficial.” Rather than talking about moral and immoral or good and bad, try to individualize these decisions. Is this good for me and my family, or is this not beneficial for me and my family? That’s going to look different from person to person.\\n\\nDana: When I say that you don’t need a budget, the most important thing I’m looking at is eliminating that reliance on restriction and the kinds of boundaries that require you to live a smaller life. You need to be aware of what’s happening with your money, but it’s not just an awareness of where your money’s going because that kind of exercise can lead to self-judgment. You should also be aware of what money is coming in and what resources you have access to. What goals are you trying to achieve, and how can you use money as a part of all of that?\\n\\nThis doesn’t mean making a spending plan, and it doesn’t mean restricting your spending according to someone else’s rules — but it does mean being aware of money because it’s one of the things you’re dealing with in life. It’s one piece of your life that you’re being mindful about, the same way that you are about anything else.\\n\\nJill: It’s like asking whether you can have beneficial relationships and interactions in the future without looking at what your past relationships and interactions have been. You just can’t. That’s not to say that we’re going to look back with shame, but we won’t be able to make money decisions and choices if we don’t know what we’ve already been doing with our money.\\n\\nJen: The anticipation of finding that out is typically a lot more overwhelming than what you actually find out. It’s also a good idea to reframe some of the negative feelings that might come up. Instead of feeling guilty, for example, you can acknowledge that you regret some of your past decisions. That’s healthy. Regret helps you understand that you can change, and it helps you decide what to do next.\\n\\nJill: Writing this book has helped me manage some of my own financial regrets and reframe them as learning opportunities.\\n\\nJen: For me, writing the book has given me accountability to practice what I preach. When I spend, it’s on something that I truly value — and if it’s to meet a need, I want to make sure what I buy is meeting that need 100 percent, instead of trying to put money towards something that money can’t buy.\\n\\nDana: What I’ve learned from writing about personal finance is this empowerment of understanding how things work. How our financial systems work and how they interact with our culture and our political systems.'},\n",

Getty Images\\n\\nUziel Gomez, 26, can relate to his Gen Z clients who are navigating adulthood and personal finance for the first time.\\n\\nIt’s no secret that young people have faced a range of financial challenges early in their lives and careers, including the Covid-19 pandemic, rapidly rising costs of living, and steep tuition, says Gomez, founder of the financial planning firm Primeros Financial. Some of his Gen Z clients ask him about how to help out their parents financially. Looking ahead to the future, Gomez knows he’ll face a similar predicament.\\n\\n“There’s some clients, they’re their parents’ full retirement plan,” he says. “Take me, for example, I’m my dad’s retirement plan.”\\n\\nVox Culture Culture reflects society.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\\n\\nThat’s just one of the many scenarios Gen Z-ers seek help navigating. Young people are also wondering about how to save for sabbaticals before retirement, have enough in their emergency funds, and discern fact from fiction when evaluating money management tips from social media.\\n\\nI spoke to three young financial planners about the typical advice they give Gen Z as they map out their financial futures — and how it remains the same and diverges from the conventional wisdom given to the generations that came before.\\n\\nComing up with financial goals that reflect your values\\n\\nOf course, some of the advice geared toward Gen Z mirrors that of their predecessors.\\n\\nWhen young clients come to Naima Bush, a financial guide at the firm Fruitful, she asks them whether they are building emergency savings, if they are paying off credit card or other high-interest debt, and if they’re getting a company match on their retirement savings account — three perennially important priorities.\\n\\nOne of the primary tasks Bush assists her clients with is getting out and staying out of high-interest debt. While many Gen Z-ers want to avoid taking on student loan debt, it’s pretty easy for them to accumulate debt in other ways, such as buy now, pay later apps, she says.\\n\\nBeyond that, Bush works with her Gen Z clients on their broader financial goals and urges them to interrogate where those aspirations originated. A common one that she broaches in her conversations is the dream of home ownership, which has become out of reach for many young would-be buyers.\\n\\n“Because buying a house is such a big decision, [I ask] is this something that you want to do because you really want to plant roots somewhere, or is this something that you want to do just for the sake of ‘Everyone else is doing it,’” Bush says. “Let’s figure out something else that is really more in line with your values.” Some clients want to be able to sustain their current lifestyle, while others want to live overseas for a while, Bush, 33, explains. Her entrepreneurial clients, meanwhile, want her help with mapping out how they can get their business or side hustle off the ground.\\n\\nRethinking careers and retirement\\n\\nThough many Gen Z-ers receive retirement benefits through their jobs, the concept of retirement will likely look very different for them. Nate Hoskin, founder and lead adviser at Hoskin Capital, says relying on the Social Security system or traditional pensions no longer feels like a safe option for his young clients.\\n\\nIn response to that uncertainty, Hoskin, 26, says his clients are working hard now to better achieve stability in the future. That might mean working on weekends or longer hours, holding down a job as they study for a degree, or delaying milestones like buying a house, he explains. Hoskin also provides projections for how much they’ll need to save to stay afloat in retirement without Social Security, making any of those payouts a nice bonus, he says.\\n\\nUnlike many baby boomers, Gen Z-ers don’t see themselves remaining loyal to one company for decades and retiring with a pension. As a result, the generation is more inclined to job hop until they find a role that’s more rewarding or better aligns with their passions, Bush says.\\n\\nBush, who works with clients earning a range of incomes, says the key to building the life you want is creating the habit of saving, even if it’s just $5 or $10 per month. And as your income increases, don’t drastically increase your spending.\\n\\n“You should be focusing instead on saving more for future you,” Bush says.\\n\\nBe wary of flashy financial advice on social media\\n\\nOne problem specific to Gen Z is the firehose of financial advice they are exposed to through social media. While hearing other people’s experiences on TikTok and Instagram can be helpful and occasionally empowering, some of the advice out there is downright misleading, Gomez says.\\n\\nAmong the bad pieces of advice he’s had to debunk are that it’s better being an entrepreneur than having a traditional 9-to-5 to build wealth and that having a spending plan (meaning budget) is limiting you, Gomez says.\\n\\nBush says Gen Z’s social media savviness can help them find useful tips, but it can also overwhelm them with information that isn’t applicable to their situation. “This can cause you to have decision overload or decision fatigue and information overload,” Bush says.\\n\\nRather than following and trying to beat the market, “investing should be boring,” Gomez says.\\n\\nThe flood of information Gen Z ingests through social media doesn’t just make it harder to find good advice; it also causes them to compare themselves to others. Gomez says he’s had to counsel his clients through FOMO (fear of missing out) while watching others make their own money moves.\\n\\nSome were interested, for instance, in investing in cryptocurrency or individual stocks that were going to make it “to the moon” a few years ago. Rather than following and trying to beat the market, “investing should be boring,” he says.\\n\\nHe has also had to field questions about building passive income investments — a frequent subject of social media’s hustle aficionados.\\n\\n“A lot of people try to find a lot of get rich or get wealthy quick and easy information that is available online,” Gomez says. “Really, it’s about honing down and controlling what you can control and really focusing on your career, saving what you can and investing as well.”\\n\\nCaring for loved ones\\n\\nMany young people are already thinking about how they want to support their parents financially in the future. Gomez advises his clients to determine how much help their families need and how much they can realistically afford to provide, whether that’s on a monthly basis or for one-off emergencies. They should also consider the trade-offs of these arrangements, Gomez says. Will it affect their lifestyle? Will it impact other goals, such as saving for a home, retirement or other priorities?\\n\\nEstablishing boundaries is also crucial. In addition to figuring out how much support they can give, Gomez recommends being clear about whether the financial support is strictly for essentials, such as housing, medical expenses, and groceries, or if it can be used for discretionary expenses like travel, dining, or entertainment.\\n\\nTake that vacation\\n\\nOne thing Gen Z-ers seem to be clear on is that they want to use their money to embark on new experiences. Some have plans to relocate and live abroad for months at a time, Bush says. Others want to make sure they have money set aside for making meaningful memories — like seeing Beyoncé in concert whenever they can.\\n\\nStill, Hoskin has found that even his high-earning Gen Z clients are cautious with money — they pour much of their income into emergency funds, health savings accounts, and retirement accounts, and are prudent even with their discretionary spending.\\n\\nFor those who make a healthy income and are still concerned about the cost of taking a vacation or spending $300 on a flight home to visit their parents, Hoskin encourages them to go. That hesitancy likely stems from Gen Z-ers entering an unstable economy and developing a survival mindset, he says. They worry that if they part with their money, it won’t replenish in the future, he adds. Noticing a similar pattern among his clients, Gomez adds that his Gen Z clients, who often are the first in their family to build wealth, feel guilty about spending when they feel that they should instead save for the future or save for their parents.'},\n",

No, not that.\\n\\nI’m talking, of course, about sleep, that vital state that lets us recharge and even cleanses the day’s toxins from our brains. But what happens when it doesn’t come easily? And why do some people have an easier time falling and staying asleep than others?\\n\\nThose are just some of the questions we answer on this week’s episode of Explain It to Me, Vox’s go-to hotline for all the questions you can’t quite answer on your own.\\n\\nTo get to the root of what’s keeping you up at night, we spoke with Jade Wu, a sleep psychologist who specializes in helping people with insomnia. So what constitutes a good sleeper? “It’s more complicated than you would guess, “ Wu says. “We think of getting enough sleep as important for good sleep. But believe it or not, recently some big studies have found that the timing of your sleep can maybe matter even more.”\\n\\nExplain It to Me The Explain It to Me newsletter answers an interesting question from an audience member in a digestible explainer from one of our journalists.

That’s what we tackle this week.\\n\\nBelow is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.\\n\\nYou can listen to Explain It to Me on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you’d like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.\\n\\nWhat are the big sleep dysfunctions?\\n\\nThe most common problem I see is insomnia, which is just trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. And that can be from a variety of sources. A lot of times it’s a life stage issue. For example, a lot of women experience sleep disruption during perimenopause and menopause.\\n\\nAnd if you go through a job loss or you move or you go to a really fun bachelor party and you don’t sleep for three nights in a row, then you find you can’t get yourself back on track with sleep.\\n\\nInsomnia is really in the eye of the beholder. There’s not a number cutoff, like say, you take an hour to fall asleep or you have to be awake for two hours during the night to qualify. It’s really if you feel like you’re taking a long time to fall asleep or back to sleep, or you feel like your sleep is very restless or non-restorative. If it’s been happening for more than a few weeks and it’s really interfering with your functioning, then it’s insomnia.\\n\\nIf it’s been happening for more than a few weeks and it’s really interfering with your functioning, then it’s insomnia.\\n\\nAnother big issue is daytime sleepiness. This is kind of the opposite problem, where it’s not that you can’t fall asleep: It’s that you can’t stay awake really well during the day. And this can be from a variety of sources, too.\\n\\nThe most common is probably sleep apnea, which is a sleep disorder characterized by repeated episodes of breathing cessation or shallow breathing during sleep. And this affects everybody. It’s not just older folks. It’s not just people who are overweight or obese. Women actually are under-diagnosed by a significant margin — something like eight or nine out of 10 women with sleep apnea are not diagnosed. That can cause daytime sleepiness, and be a burden to your heart health and brain health. It’s a really important topic that people don’t pay enough attention to.\\n\\nAnd then there are kind of more colorful sleep issues, like sleep paralysis, sleep hallucinations, sleepwalking — more of unusual things that happen at night.\\n\\nWe got a call from a listener named Skylar who is curious about sleep chronotypes — the time of day your body naturally winds down and falls asleep. They’re a night owl and they want to know if there’s a trend toward being more accommodating to people who aren’t early birds.\\n\\nI feel you, Skylar. I am a night owl, too, by nature. And I absolutely agree that society should be more understanding towards us night owls, because there is nothing inherently wrong with it. We all have our own chronotype: It’s like height. It’s kind of a bell-shaped curve. Mostly people are in the middle, and then some people are extreme morning people. Some people are extreme night owls. But society is designed by and for morning people. Those of us who are night owls struggle and we don’t get to sleep at our optimal time; we often don’t get enough sleep.\\n\\nIf you think about it evolutionarily, a tribe of early humans needed a diversity in sleep timing for everyone to stay safe. Let’s say everybody fell asleep at the exact same time, slept through the night, and woke up at the same time.Then that’s easy pickings for a saber-toothed tiger. We night owls should be saying, “You’re welcome” for keeping watch so the rest of you can sleep safely and soundly.\\n\\nWhat makes someone like Skylar a night owl? What determines where on that bell curve of sleep people land?\\n\\nA lot of it is genetic. Melatonin is a time-keeping hormone that our brains release. It usually ramps up in the evening, stays high through the night, and then kind of goes away in the mornings. It signals to the whole body that it’s time to shut down the factories and rest and sleep, or that it’s time to ramp up and get started for the day.\\n\\nWe night owls should be saying, “You’re welcome” for keeping watch so the rest of you can sleep safely and soundly.\\n\\nFor those of us who are night owls, our melatonin curve starts later and then goes away later, too. So when other people are already soundly asleep, our melatonin curves are still acting as if it’s still daytime. And then in the early mornings, when other people are ready and raring to go, our melatonin is still high in our system, telling us it’s still nighttime. On an individual level, there are things we can do to shift our chronotypes to better kind of fake it as a morning person and to have an easier time waking up.\\n\\nWhat advice do you have for people like Skylar, who are night owls living in a world that’s very 9-to-5?\\n\\nWell, Skylar, if you can swing it, live on the East Coast and work for a company on the West Coast remotely. That’s the ideal situation. I’ve had patients actually do that.\\n\\nBut if you can’t swing that, the best thing is to get lots of bright light first thing in the morning. Ideally, as soon as you wake up, either use a light box or go outside. It’s not enough to just open your shades or curtains. You have to actually be in broad spectrum — full sunlight for about 20 minutes. And that really helps your brain wake up and teach your circadian rhythm to start the day earlier, and to also release that melatonin earlier in the evening too.\\n\\nThe thing about sleep is that it’s universal. Everybody needs it. But so many people have sleep problems. Why do you think it is? What is it that’s so tricky about sleep?\\n\\nThere are so many reasons. I think we probably don’t have enough time to do the whole thing. But I’d love to get on a soapbox sometime and talk about capitalism — and how that has shaped …\\n\\nI love soapboxes. Yes. Climb on up there, girl.\\n\\nWhen the Western world at least industrialized, we took on this, eight hours for work, eight hours for sleep, and eight hours for whatever you will kind of slogan. And so we started taking on expectations and constraints around our sleep that we didn’t have before.\\n\\nRelated The sleep advice no one tells you\\n\\nDo we sleep worse than we used to now? I think of all the screentime we have.\\n\\nI imagine that we probably are a little bit worse at sleep because of everything from the 24/7 access to information we have, to little dopamine hits, to bright lights in the middle of the night, to all of these technology-enabled distractions that can really keep us up when we ought to be sleeping.\\n\\nWhy is getting good sleep so important? What does that do for us?'},\n",

Before he knows it, he hasn’t spoken to a single person in hours. When he finally emerges, he has two options: to grind away and continue ignoring fellow faculty and students, or, to pop into a colleague’s office to see how they’re doing, to offer a quick hello to passersby.\\n\\nHall has co-authored numerous studies, and now a new book, that urges all of us to pick the latter option, and to reap the benefits of a life lived socially. One study, for example, found that people who had more social interactions over the course of four weeks had greater well-being. Another showed that having just one quality conversation with a friend each day can improve mental health.\\n\\nVox Culture Culture reflects society.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\\n\\nThese habits help form what Hall and his co-author Andy Merolla, a professor at the University of California Santa Barbara, call the social biome, a way of thinking about the entire range of your social interactions. A healthy social biome is one with variety — among the types of people we talk to and the kinds of conversations we have — as well as alone time.\\n\\nHall and Merolla distilled their research as well as the studies of other social scientists into their book The Social Biome: How Everyday Communication Connects and Shapes Us. Not only do Hall and Merolla outline the reasons why we’re sometimes reluctant to connect with others (being social requires energy and people are messy), but they also offer simple correctives. Here are seven simple strategies Hall and Merolla recommend that can help pull you out of isolation, have better interactions, and improve your social biome. No social overhaul necessary.\\n\\nTalk to strangers\\n\\nInteracting with close friends and family isn’t the only way to boost happiness — chatting with strangers does, too. Not only is the experience more pleasant than we suspect it might be, but the person on the other side enjoys the conversation, too. “To offer dignity to another person in your community, to especially someone who’s different from you,” Hall says, “and by stretching yourself outside just the people you know well, you’re actually building a healthier environment for all of us.”\\n\\nRelated How to master the art of small talk\\n\\nYou don’t need to wander around looking for strangers to talk to, Hall says, but instead can embrace opportunities to engage in small talk with people you already see in the course of your day: a bus driver, the mail carrier, a cashier at the store.\\n\\nFocus on quality interaction every day\\n\\nWhen it comes to the types of conversations that seem to make a difference in people’s well-being, Hall has found that quality conversations are crucial. There are four different kinds of conversations that count as quality, Hall found: meaningful talk (like a heart-to-heart), catching up, expressing affection, and joking around.\\n\\nYou can have a quality interaction with anyone from a coworker or a roommate to a romantic partner or best friend. And all you need is one a day. Don’t worry about being particularly witty or funny or any of the hallmarks of a “skilled” conversationalist. Instead, focus on being a good listener and discussing topics that matter to the other person. “Quality conversation can just be slowing down your day,” Hall says, “and taking the time to catch up and be close to the people who are part of your life.”\\n\\nBut don’t discount small talk\\n\\nNot all talk has to be big talk. Just as quality conversation connects people, so too does small talk or casual chit chat, like office banter with your coworkers. These conversations are low energy, Hall says, but enhance connection.\\n\\n“There’s studies that have said people hate chitchat,” he says, “but actually have better days when they engage in it.” Small talk with acquaintances expends very little social energy and can contribute to feelings of belongingness within the community.\\n\\nDiscuss a diverse range of topics with a diverse range of people\\n\\nOne study published in 2022 found that the greater diversity of people with whom participants interacted — including strangers, acquaintances, close friends, and family — the greater their well-being.\\n\\nIt’s also important to engage with people who have different perspectives than you do. You don’t need to wade into potentially thorny territory — nor do you offer space to someone with harmful opinions — but exposure to other’s lives and beliefs can expand your worldview.\\n\\nMaking — and keeping — plans is crucial\\n\\nGiven that some of our social interaction is wholly outside of our control — you can’t opt out of checking in with your boss, for example — freely choosing to hang out with a friend is a gift you can give yourself.\\n\\nMaking the choice to be social is especially difficult at the end of an exhausting day when your impulse may be to veg out on the couch. This is why having plans on the docket — and sticking to them — is so crucial. Keep your social calendar populated with friend dates and try to avoid bailing (even if you want to). Having a routine, like a weekly call with your sister, or a regularly standing get-together, like a book club, eliminates a lot of the energy involved in scheduling a time to hang out.\\n\\nUnderstand the limits of technology\\n\\nIn a world where many of our connections are mediated through screens, it’s helpful to understand how some forms of technology can make you feel more socially fulfilled compared to others.\\n\\nHall says to think of the ways we interact as a ladder, with the lowest rungs offering the least benefit. All the way on the bottom is passively consuming your friends’ content on social media. The next rung up is group chats, then texting one-on-one. While texting is better than not keeping in touch at all, it shouldn’t be your sole form of communication. The next rung up is video chats and phone calls. All the way at the top is face-to-face communication. “The feeling of being around someone you care about,” Hall says, “is really where the evidence points to in terms of building well-being in the long run.”\\n\\nAlthough online communities can be especially validating for people with marginalized backgrounds or disabilities, Hall says you need in-person interaction, too. “The literature is actually pretty clear that living an only online existence probably is not suitable to human flourishing,” he says. “It’s better than nothing, but it’s probably not enough.”\\n\\nEmbrace alone time\\n\\nA balanced social life also includes time spent alone. Using solo time to relax and think fondly on past social interactions helps recharge your social batteries. “You’re thinking through the relationships you have with people, things you’re happy about,” Hall says. “[That’s] when alone time is at its best, and it’s used to restore and refresh and it opens the possibility of future connection.”\\n\\nRecent evidence points to the fact that Americans are engaging in more alone time than ever. Solitude and social time are not at odds: You need one to appreciate the other. Quiet downtime helps prepare you for connection and affirming social interaction allows you to enjoy being alone. A fulfilling social life is one with equilibrium.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"What exactly is going on in the minds of young men? It’s a question that society keeps coming back to these days because, truth is, we’re worried. Everything we’re told about the rising generation of men in America—everything they’re told about themselves, in the media, the academic research, the employment data, the mental-health studies—is about how royally screwed they are. And that has consequences for all of us.\\n\\nYou’ve read the headlines. Young men today are angry. They’re lonely and friendless. The data shows that they are falling behind young women in school and at the workplace, living with their parents longer, playing too many video games, watching too much porn, getting married much later in life (or not at all), having fewer kids (or none at all), and facing a lifetime of student-loan debt, credit-card debt, and medical debt. As a result, many of them are adopting increasingly extreme beliefs, getting hooked on opioids, and killing themselves at alarming rates. They feel ignored by politicians, blamed for society’s ills, and forced to keep their toxic, privileged, microaggressive mouths shut about it.\\n\\nBut what no one can seem to agree on is why. Is social media to blame? There’s no doubt that growing up in the age of the smartphone has profoundly shaped the lives (and brains) of anyone under twenty-five, and most of the rest of us, too. But that applies to young women as well, and they don’t seem to be drifting as badly as men are.\\n\\nSources: Aspen Economic Strategy Group. Pew Research Center. CIRCLE Tufts.\\n\\nRather than add our voice to the chorus of speculation about what guys are thinking and feeling about the world, we had a radical idea: Let’s just ask them. Not all of them, of course. There are nearly 16 million men in the U. S. between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four. We weren’t looking to conduct yet another survey. Instead, we wanted to have long conversations with a relatively small group about what it’s like to be a young man in America right now.\\n\\nOur first step was to seek out regular, everyday guys. No influencers or celebrities or lunatics. Just guys like the ones we all know. Guys with so many of their big life decisions still ahead of them. In the end, we settled on twelve men from different parts of the country representing a wide range of backgrounds and experiences. We asked them to submit portrait photos of themselves, and most of them did. As you’ll see, they reflect much of the frustration and alienation we expected—but not always in the ways we anticipated. They were thoughtful and candid. They surprised us.\\n\\nSources: Aspen Economic Strategy Group. Pew Research Center. CIRCLE Tufts.\\n\\nIf there was one subject that came up again and again, it was Donald Trump. Timing had a lot to do with it. Our conversations followed Trump’s reelection in November, a victory powered in part by young male voters. Men between the ages of eighteen and twenty-nine voted for Trump over Kamala Harris by a margin of 56–42, a dramatic reversal of 2020, when they voted for Biden over Trump by a 56–41 margin. For the young men we spoke with—guys who’ve come of age in the MAGA era—talking about Trump was often shorthand for discussing class, race, masculinity, and the big subjects that were really on their minds. Here’s what they had to say, in their own words.\\n\\nAIDAN SILVA\\n\\nCollege student, age 19\\n\\nSan Jose, California\\n\\nSelf-Portrait by contributor\\n\\nI noticed the shift in people of color moving conservative a year, maybe a year and a half in advance. I remember a conversation with my mom about seven months before the election—we were in the swimming pool, and she was like, “Oh, this election, I’m not sure what’s going to happen.” And I told her, “Trump has already won the election. I know for a fact.” Because he’d stolen the support of people of color from the Democrats, especially men.\\n\\nYou could just see it. The first thing I noticed was how conservative so many young Hispanic men were—it is mind-\\xadboggling to me how conservative. My girlfriend is half Latino, and she kept telling me, “Aidan, Latino men are more conservative than people think.” This notion that Latinos always support Democrats—it’s very false. I was also noticing in my community, a bunch of Asian American men, they were thinking the same way. They were starting to talk out loud about supporting Trump.\\n\\nTo me, it’s not necessarily that men were drawn to Trump—it’s men pulling away from Democrats.\\n\\nThe first thing was the LGBTQ community normalizing the idea that you can have a bunch of genders, you can have whatever pronouns you want, and that you can introduce that to very young children. And then with Asian men, the Harvard case that overturned affirmative action a few years ago—remember, the people who filed the lawsuit were not white. They were Chinese. They were like, Wait, affirmative action discriminates against us. That’s when the Chinese vote started to go. And then I did not realize this, but my friend’s also Vietnamese, and she was telling me that most Vietnamese people are conservative. So guess what? Now Trump’s got the Vietnamese support. And obviously his white male support is only growing. So in my head I’m like, How is Biden going to win this election? He’s lost half the people of color to Trump.\\n\\nTo me, it’s not necessarily that men were drawn to Trump—it’s men pulling away from Democrats. That’s one key thing I really want to say. I think this shift happened not necessarily because of anything Trump was doing. It’s because of what the Democrats did. They decided to let in all this pronoun stuff and this whole idea of censoring young men and emasculating them. And then with people of color, like me, they seem to assume, like, Of course you’re going to vote for us. We’re your allies. We’re going to help you. The Republicans aren’t going to do anything for you. But then the Democrats get in power in 2020, and people of color are kind of waiting, like, Okay, so . . . what are you going to do for us? And then you look at the end and the Black community is still in the same position. Asian Americans are now getting discriminated against in educational systems, and you’re losing Latinos because of this LGBTQ stuff that’s relevant to literally 1 percent of the population and you’re trying to kind of force it on everyone else.\\n\\nZACHARY LONG\\n\\nSocial-media video producer, age 27\\n\\nLas Vegas, Nevada\\n\\nSelf-Portrait by contributor\\n\\nI dropped out of community college because I got a job as a butler at the Venetian casino and I was making good money, so I put everything else on the back burner. What a butler does is, from the moment the whales and high-end guests arrive, we greet them, we grab their things, we bring them their food, we do everything they need—personalized and intimate service. The tips can get pretty big. I got $750 once. I know a guy who once got $5,000.\\n\\nBut that job didn’t work out. There was an issue where I accepted a tip—for one dollar—and I forgot to write it down on my log at the end of the day. The next day I had to go out of town, and by the time I came back, HR was already involved. Every square inch of that building is monitored. When they saw on my log that I didn’t have anything tipped in, one of the other coworkers was like, “No, no—I was right there when he accepted his tip.” He ratted me out. They went back into the footage and I got fired.\\n\\nI was very, very upset. I was ready to settle down and get really good at that job. I like learning new things, and it was this world of whiskeys and wine and fine dining—all this luxurious stuff that I’d never been exposed to. I grew up lower middle class, so it was an entirely new world. That was the best part about coming into work every day—something new to learn, a new problem to solve. And then all of a sudden I was back at my job at Domino’s.\\n\\nBeing a butler definitely jaded me. Look, I feel like successful people should be able to appreciate the fruits of their labor. That doesn’t bother me. And a lot of rich people aren’t insanely rich—they’re millionaires, not billionaires. They’re normal people when it comes down to it. But when you start dealing with old-money people—how they treat the people around them and the people under them—it opens your eyes. I would overhear conversations around a poker table where executives are talking like, “Well, if we get rid of this department here and we lay off six hundred people here, we can put that money here.” Meanwhile they’re playing poker with $100,000 a hand. The most insane thing I can remember was buying suitcases for a guest because they bought all these bottles of liquor from us and they needed something to take them home in. Two suitcases full of approximately $300,000 worth of wine and liquor.\\n\\nI have friends going hungry, not because they don’t want to work but because they’re not given enough hours to be full-time and get health insurance.\\n\\nIt’s the frivolousness that’s the breaking point for me—the way they can spend all that money and have no repercussions, but those repercussions spread to us, lower down. It’s fucking bullshit. I have friends going hungry, not because they don’t want to work but because they’re not given enough hours to be full-time and get health insurance.\\n\\nFive years ago, if you had a job that paid fifteen to twenty dollars an hour, you were set. And now it doesn’t feel like that anymore. Your dollar just doesn’t go as far. Real estate has doubled here in Vegas. The eleven-hundred-square-foot apartment that I rented with my girlfriend in 2018 for $1,100—I looked a few weeks ago, and now it’s going for $1,950. It’s so hard to build savings right now. I spent years building up enough for a down payment on a house, and I’d just gotten to the point where I could feasibly do it, and then I needed to pay for a car repair earlier this year and a lot of that money went away. You learn to live with this fear and paranoia, like, What if I shatter my leg and I can’t work? What would I do?\\n\\nI am not a fan of Donald Trump—I’d say I lean very left—but at the end of the day, he understands that Americans are angry and upset, and he’s really good at channeling that. As Americans, we’re all feeling the same pressures, we all see prices are rising, we’re all making less money. We all notice it. But the Republicans are a lot more ready to say, “This is the reason. It’s that guy. This is who you should be mad at.” The bigger split in America for me is not left or right. It’s class—it’s whether you’re bourgeois or you’re proletariat. It comes down to whether you make enough money to be in their special club.\\n\\nSources: Aspen Economic Strategy Group. Pew Research Center. CIRCLE Tufts.\\n\\nTJ SNIPES\\n\\nCollege student, Age 20\\n\\nWalnut Creek, California\\n\\nThere’s this pastor I like to listen to named Voddie Baucham, and he talks about how men think the definition of manhood is the Three B’s: the billfold, the ball field, and the bedroom. Like, it’s all about how much money you make, how well you perform at sports, and how many girls you can get with in the bedroom. And I think that’s . . . not totally wrong? I mean they are signs. If you can perform on the ball field, that shows power and strength and your ability to protect yourself, which is important. If you’re making money, that doesn’t automatically mean you’re competent, but it shows signs of competency. And then bedroom—I don’t know, that one doesn’t make as much sense. But his point was that the Three B’s are how the culture is defining manhood today, and the correct way is how the Bible defines it, which is all about love and family and sacrifice.\\n\\nMy friends say I’m a based Christian guy—“based” like based in truth, someone who’s more realistic and objective. I appreciate the objective truth of conservatism, but I also understand the compassion of liberals. Overall, I’d say I’m like 60 percent conservative, 40 percent liberal. Maybe 70–30. And Christianity is a really good guide for being conservative, because there’s this objective eternal being at the center of it who’s been unchanged the whole time.\\n\\nI think minority guys are tired of feeling like they are expected to vote a certain way just because of their color.\\n\\nAnd I do believe some things are just objectively true, like: I am a man. It doesn’t really matter if someone wants to be called a man—that doesn’t change what you are. Sorry, that’s it. You weren’t assigned it by a doctor. You were assigned it by God. And going against that is rebellion. If God’s making these rules, it’s not because He wants to be a cosmic killjoy. If I’m going to trust anyone about the world, I would trust the person who made it. It’s like going against the video game developer’s ideas for how to play the video game. You’re just going to lose.\\n\\nFor thousands of years, men have been the rock of society. And now because there have been so many tyrannical leaders, people want to take that power away from men and say it’s for everybody. Just because some men did it the wrong way. Like, it’s kind of unfair to men to say, “We don’t need you anymore because of how well you did at building a society.” And I’m like, “Well, we kind of built this country and fought and died for it . . .”\\n\\nI didn’t vote, because I didn’t feel like going through the process, and I didn’t see the point, because Biden was going to win California, even though it was way closer than I thought. But if someone had put a gun in my head and told me to vote, I would’ve voted for Trump. I think minority guys are tired of feeling like they are expected to vote a certain way just because of their color. Even Obama, who basically shamed Black guys for not voting for Kamala—I don’t owe you anything. I don’t owe this party nothing. I’m not going to get reprimanded by you when I’m an autonomous man who can make decisions for myself. I don’t need you to browbeat me like I’m your son.\\n\\nETHAN GREENE\\n\\nUrban planner, age 27\\n\\nGolden, Colorado\\n\\nSelf-Portrait by contributor\\n\\nSometimes I think we’re like an anti-welfare state. We’re not really into helping people in this country. I just feel like we live in a very individualistic society, and so it’s all about “How do you stand out as an individual? How do you make yourself stand out from the pack?” You can even see this with car culture in our country—young men always want to buy the most massive truck and drive around in it. I live outside Denver in a town called Golden, and the Colorado School of Mines, which is a big petroleum and gas college, is here in Golden. So a lot of guys come out here from Texas and they drive these giant lifted pickup trucks—these massive old F-150’s that’ve been jacked up so there’s like three feet of separation between the wheels and the body.\\n\\nI grew up with a lot of these guys in Bozeman, Montana—cowboy-type dudes. That’s manhood out here in the western states: Every man wants to be a cowboy. They want to buy cowboy boots and the cowboy hat and drive an old pickup truck, or the new pickup truck if they’re wealthy. And they vote for Republicans. I didn’t really like those guys. I grew up with two sisters, so I guess I’ve always been more comfortable around women.\\n\\nIf you’re not overconfident, it’s really hard to get ahead in this country. You really have to act like you know what you’re talking about all the time. And that’s definitely not something that I was doing in the past. I hate talking about myself, promoting myself. But when I decided to go to grad school, I just kind of made up my mind that I was going to start. I made this separation in my brain between my home life and my work life—at work, I was going to be this alternative person who was really competitive and confident all the time and could talk about himself very easily. And as soon as I made that switch, people were a lot more attracted to me. I’m getting treated better by this country, by our systems, our culture. That’s how America works.\\n\\nMy generation—I don’t think we have very much power, so maybe that’s part of our anger. Our lives are being dictated by people who are decades and decades older.\\n\\nPeople in this country love confident people who seem like they’re smart, who seem to know what they’re talking about, even if they don’t. And Donald Trump is the embodiment of the confident man who doesn’t know what he’s talking about. He’s like: Take what you want, grab it, it’s yours—everyone else is telling you you’re not supposed to be this way, but you’re allowed to be this way because I’m this way. He’s kind of a reaction to all the beta cucks out there—men like me, I guess.\\n\\nBut I don’t think that it’s just my generation of men that’s angry. I think it’s all of them. It’s the emotion that men are taught. It’s the one that we get. It’s not manly to feel all the other ones. But anger is for sure. My generation—I don’t think we have very much power, so maybe that’s part of our anger. Our lives are being dictated by people who are decades and decades older than us, and they just don’t get it. They just don’t understand that the world has changed, that you can’t buy a house for three lucky magic beans anymore.\\n\\nI feel like our generation is just waiting for our moment to take up our power, but I don’t know if we’re ever going to get there, because it seems like these boomers are trying to hang on forever. I see it in my work, too—anytime you go to a public hearing or a city-\\xadcouncil meeting, they dominate those meetings, because they have time and resources to show up. They’re really dictating our future even though it’s not going to affect them. And that’s really frustrating. It’s like they were raised in a time of bounty and we don’t get a slice of the pie. They have the entire pie.\\n\\nJACINTO OBREGON\\n\\nHigh school chemistry teacher, age 26\\n\\nEl Paso, Texas\\n\\nSelf-Portrait by contributor\\n\\nI was born in Nicaragua and immigrated with my parents to the United States when I was really young. We lived in Miami for a few years, then in 2004 we moved to El Paso, Texas, and that’s where I grew up. Now I teach at an all-boys Catholic private school in California, and my kids are juniors—the age where they think they know everything and can get away with anything. Before the election this past November, some of them were asking me political things, like, “Yo, Mr. O”—that’s what they call me, Mr. O—“what do you think of Trump?” And I’d always say, “That’s not your business.” I’d tell them that the faculty handbook says I have to be nonpartisan. And one of them said, “But we need to know! Please don’t tell me you voted for Kamala!” And this was actually a Black student, by the way. Not that just because you’re Black, you should be voting for Kamala—it was just a little more unexpected. I come to find out that a lot of my students, and I mean a lot of them, are very conservative.\\n\\nOur school is very, very sports heavy. Our academics are amazing, don’t get me wrong—but sports are where it shines. Out of about 1,100 total students, maybe 900 are student athletes, and of course football is king. There was even a movie about our team that came out like a decade ago. I’ve been there three years now, but when I first started, I was this five-foot-eight, soft-spoken Hispanic teacher, and I’m teaching all these sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds who were six-foot-five, these enormous—like, what are they putting in the water here? Think of a hobbit in the Shire—that’s me, and everyone else is the elves.\\n\\nI do feel—not marginalized, but I feel like when people think of men or masculinity, I’m not the image that comes to their head.\\n\\nMy first year, especially, was really hard because they could get very disrespectful. I had students yell at me, berate me just for asking them to put their phones away. It’s like, “Why am I being abused right now?” They wouldn’t necessarily make it obvious that it was because they think I’m less of a man or because I’m smaller. But I could tell it didn’t help. For a lot of these kids, their norm was coaches who would yell at them, which is not how I roll. There were days when I broke down in front of the students. I just couldn’t handle it anymore. It was like they were experimenting with dominance. And I mention all this because I think they really want that dominance to continue. I think they like getting away with talking very, very confidently. And I think they see Trump talking what I think is nonsense, but they’re like, “Oh, wow—he gets away with saying that!” And so they want to emulate that. They want that power.\\n\\nThere was this friend group in my class that year—all of them were athletes for different sports, and they actually ended up becoming one of my favorite groups of students. The next year, they told me I was their favorite teacher. Even the ones who gave me a lot of issues said that. And I was like, “Wow, thank you—but if I’m your favorite teacher, why did you behave like this to me? Are you only going to follow the people who berate you? Are those the only people you’re going to respect? Because that’s kind of a crappy way to live, no?” And they said it was because my class was the only break they got from hard teachers and hard coaches. It was like a period of peace. They’d spend the rest of the day getting taught that weakness must be stamped out and eradicated. And then they meet me and I flip the whole thing on its head.\\n\\nSometimes I do think to myself, Why am I like this? I’m not going to get anywhere being like this. I do get resentful sometimes. I’m not going to lie. I do feel—not marginalized, but I feel like when people think of men or masculinity, I’m not the image that comes to their head. I’ve always felt that way. At the same time, so many people, whether it be my classmates, my friends, my relatives, my students, my coworkers, everyone has said, “Jacinto, you’re one of the kindest people I’ve ever met—please don’t ever, ever change.” And it’s like, “Okay, see? So we do celebrate this other side of the coin. Sometimes.”\\n\\nSources: Aspen Economic Strategy Group. Pew Research Center. CIRCLE Tufts.\\n\\nEMILIO RIOS\\n\\nAspiring filmmaker & NYU student, age 21\\n\\nBrooklyn, New York\\n\\nSelf-Portrait by contributor\\n\\nWhen the election happened, I was so blindsided and distraught that for a month or so I just kind of turned that whole part of my brain off. I guess I live in a bubble, right? I go to NYU—a very liberal school, very performatively progressive, though I think the key word there is performative. But needless to say, I don’t have anybody close to me who voted for Trump or even considered voting for him. I guess that’s why I really thought Kamala was going to win. I wasn’t even that worried, because in my mind, I was like, We already went through four years of this douchebag. We know the type of person that he is. I just really thought that people were sick of him, regardless of where you are on the political spectrum. And then I was watching those numbers on election night, and that sinking feeling started, just like in 2016.\\n\\nI’m trying to make sense of it now. I’ve really tried to put myself in the mindset of just your average twenty-year-old Latino dude, because I know that’s where he gained a surprising advantage, and that shocked me the most. I guess a couple things jump out. Like, whether you like it or not, Trump does fall into that ultramasculine, ultra-fragile-ego archetype, and he disguises the fragility with machismo, with bravado, with boldness. Saying things with his chest. No matter how wrong he is, he carries this energy of absolute confidence. And I think that when you’re an impressionable young man, that’s appealing. It’s like, “I want to be a guy who’s not afraid to say whatever I want to say.”\\n\\nMy generation is not in an optimal position. Honestly, it kind of feels like I was born too late.\\n\\nI’m the son of a Mexican immigrant who’s legal now—he has a green card—but for a while, he wasn’t. And I remember being a young kid in 2016 and hearing Trump say those things about Mexicans being rapists and criminals. And so obviously I’m like, That’s not who I am. That’s not who my father is. So in my mind, from a young age, there was an immediate fuck-you toward Trump. I identify with the immigrants from all these Latin American countries. I identify with that struggle. I see their pain.\\n\\nBut not all Latino people, and especially not all Latino men, think that way. They feel like they’re citizens, they’re good, their family’s good. Whereas the people coming here now—they think they can just walk in, hand themselves over to border authorities, and then get shipped off to a sanctuary city without having to go through all of the pain that my family went through? That’s not fair.\\n\\nI definitely sense this sort of Democrat-\\xadequals-good sentiment among my friends, but I very much do not identify with the Democratic Party. Seeing how people like Joe Biden were utterly indifferent to—actively in support of—Israel’s genocide, like, yes, on paper, at a glance, the Democratic Party has more of a progressive agenda, but in practice, do they? That was how I felt about Kamala, to be honest. Obviously I wasn’t going to vote for Trump—hell no, never—but I wasn’t a fan of Kamala, either. Her history, the fact that she was a prosecutor, that she put so many Black and brown people in jail—she kept showing she had no spine and no actual beliefs leading up to the election.\\n\\nI was debating who to vote for right up until I walked into that stall in the voting station—Harris or a third party. I voted for Kamala largely due to my mom, just how important her victory would’ve been for female reproductive rights and how catastrophic it would be if Trump won. And then he did.\\n\\nI need to make money and be self-\\xadsufficient as soon as I can because my mom turns sixty next year, and if she’s still hustling and working her ass off at eighty, I’m going to feel like I failed. I’ve got to make sure that in some way, shape, or form, I can give back to my parents and start helping them out by the time I’m like thirty. That’s a big priority for me. And I don’t doubt that I’ll make money. I know I have skills, and it’s not like I’m just going to be sitting around. The doubt is about whether I can make enough to support my parents one day, to live an actually comfortable life, to have savings, a 401(k), a retirement plan. The doubt is about living a financially stable life as opposed to just living check to check or gig to gig. I will try my best, but I’m going to be honest, I know that the odds are not good. My generation is not in an optimal position. Honestly, it kind of feels like I was born too late. Like I missed out on something. It feels like I’m living in a generation where we’re cleaning up after someone else’s mess.\\n\\nPADRAIG FOURNIER\\n\\nPara-educator, age 24\\n\\nSan Mateo, California\\n\\nI like to tell people I went to college undecided and I kind of came out the same way. I graduated in May of 2023. When I came home, I didn’t really know what I wanted to do. I moved back in with my parents, and that’s where I am now. My mom’s a school librarian, so she said, “Why don’t you try being a para-\\xadeducator?” And I said, “Well, I don’t have any other plans,” so now I help with third graders. It’s been a good year, and I’m grateful to have done it, but I don’t think I’d want to be a teacher. And being a para-educator is not a job where I’d be able to move out and afford rent and groceries and such. And you can’t really pay your bills with a philosophy degree.\\n\\nI play a lot of video games. This hat I’m wearing is from a game called Oblivion that came out in 2006. It’s like a fantasy role-playing kind of game. I’ve played several thousand hours throughout that series, and it’s like a lot of online spaces where you find young dudes—whether it’s video games or TV shows or Star Wars or sports or music or whatever. It’s not something you pick up on unless you’re in these spaces a lot. But take Star Wars: A lot of the top creators in those spaces are right-wing people talking about how some new Disney show is woke and bad, or how it’s forcing some lib agenda. Like, the most famous Star Wars YouTuber is a guy named Star Wars Theory, and most of his videos are just trashing all the new Star Wars shows for being DEI, whatever the term of the day is.\\n\\nIt’s just a lot easier to feel like you’re the victim of some wrongdoing. And if you’re a young man, that pipeline is ready and waiting.\\n\\nIn a lot of spaces that young men naturally gravitate toward, there’s already kind of a pipeline built, a feeling or environment of “This thing I like is under attack.” I don’t know who said it, but there’s a quote that sticks with me: “When you’re accustomed to privilege, equality looks like an attack.”\\n\\nA lot of reactionary sentiment is built on nostalgia. And the Right in America has realized that you can weaponize that natural disenchantment with the world and spin it as: Something that you like is being attacked by the Left. And to me, it’s a uniquely right-wing phenomenon—the ability to infiltrate any space and be able to steer people toward that intellectual viewpoint. Once I noticed it, it was hard not to be aware of it. Whereas I think the Left, broadly speaking, does not have anything remotely equivalent.\\n\\nIt’s the same tenor in these manosphere communities about women. I’ve only really had one serious relationship—a long story, but it didn’t work out. I’m not a big fan of the whole manosphere and red pill and all that stuff, but there were definitely times when I’d find myself scrolling on my phone, and I’d come across videos, obviously framed to show how women are bad, and I wouldn’t agree with them, but I could kind of say, at least for a little while, “Yeah, that’s how it feels.” It’s just a lot easier to feel like you’re the victim of some wrongdoing. And if you’re a young man who suffers some sort of ego injury, that online ecosystem is very easy to plug yourself into. That pipeline is ready and waiting.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN PRANGLEY\\n\\nMMA fighter, age 20\\n\\nCoeur d’Alene, Idaho\\n\\nSelf-Portrait by contributor\\n\\nI want to be champion, bro. My life is very difficult right now, and I do that to myself. I have to make it. It’s not about plan B. It’s not about plan C, bro. This isn’t like wrestling or football where there’s scholarships to college. If you don’t make it in MMA, you’re back to square one. That’s kind of the thrill of it, too, if I’m being honest.\\n\\nI had a really tough upbringing, and it turned me into kind of a sad person. My dad’s from Cape Town in South Africa. I had neighbor kids who had all this cool shit, got to play video games for eight hours a day, or who lost a tooth and then the tooth fairy came and dropped a Nintendo DS under their pillow. I never had that stuff. We were living paycheck to paycheck. We couldn’t afford meat every day of the week. My father opened up this gym, but it didn’t make any money for eight years. So he worked another full-time job, and then he also fought a little bit. The gym’s super successful now, but it was tough, bro. Life’s tough.\\n\\nSo Coeur d’Alene—I’m pretty sure they say it’s the fastest-growing city in the nation. I mean, it’s just crazy, bro. Like holy smoke. When my dad moved here for college, this was a one-stoplight town, and now it’s just a massive city. We get a ton of people from California who are like, “We don’t like our state anymore—it’s getting dangerous down there. So we’re going to go over to Idaho and change things.” Then they make it more like California. What they’re doing in the schools is just wrong. After Covid, the underclassmen just got progressively worse. Kids wearing weird stuff. Just really borderline satanic stuff. Weird colors. It’s gotten super free, in the wrong sense. Then after I graduated, they started doing the transgender bathroom stuff, so now they got a bathroom for them folks. So that is courtesy of the California people.\\n\\nCommon sense is coming back a little bit—that’s what I thought when Trump won.\\n\\nI can’t name a Democrat in this gym right now. I can’t name a friend who’s a Democrat. I don’t know anybody who voted for Kamala, honestly—anybody that’s sober. Maybe some pothead buddies that aren’t really friends of mine. But the blue side is winning, dude. This younger generation—these kids are getting brainwashed into thinking blue. And blue is definitely not a righteous route. I mean, we still don’t have the full list of Epstein’s folks. A lot of these blue guys are just totally numb to the fact that there’s right ways and wrong ways to do things in life. They just don’t care.\\n\\nBut common sense is coming back a little bit—that’s what I thought when Trump won. And I’m so thankful he won, because he says common-sense stuff, like building up the border wall. That sounds offensive, but it makes sense, because we all know where the drugs are coming from, and it’s not Canada. Also, I used to work in construction, so I see all these Hispanic folks that are working for nine or ten bucks an hour, and they’re doing double the work the Americans are doing, because they have to survive. Like, they actually are taking our jobs. They are. So I’m not a fan of immigration in that sense.\\n\\nJAHMIEL JACKSON\\n\\nSenior at the University of Chicago, age 23\\n\\nChicago, Illinois\\n\\nSelf-Portrait by contributor\\n\\nThe neighborhood where I grew up in Philadelphia—it wasn’t the worst, but it definitely wasn’t the best. My mother struggled through so much raising us. I learned from her that it’s okay to falter, but you can’t give up. I went to a horrible, underfunded public school. I wanted to be the first person in my family to graduate college, and I could see that my school wasn’t going to get me anywhere close. So I secretly applied to a private school that my mother didn’t know about. And they were so impressed that they reached out to me, gave me a tour, gave me a financial-aid package, and I started there my junior year. I went from a school that was like 98 percent Black to a predominantly white school—one of the best private schools in the country, where I got exposed to different opinions and learned how to challenge the current ideology that exists in any atmosphere. And that’s really guided me through my political transition to this day.\\n\\nA couple of years ago, like in 2020, 2021, I had blue hair. I was very far-left progressive. I protested for Black Lives Matter. I was 100 percent pro-choice. But the shift really began at this private school—all boys as well. In class we’d talk about things like the American Dream, and does it exist for African Americans? Everyone was saying the same thing: Systemic racism is the issue, and how horrible our country is. And just to be a contrarian, I said, “What if there are cultural or personal-responsibility issues that lead some people to fall short of their dreams? I went to a public school where I saw so many kids, the number-one obstacle in their lives wasn’t not having a father in their life—they just weren’t doing their homework.”\\n\\nI’d been told for so long not to go look at these sources because they're racist, they're regressive, they're harmful. And actually, it turns out I'm left wanting more. That's when I did a full factory reset. I tried to relearn things from the ground up.\\n\\nThe Black students at this private school, who were predominantly wealthy, found that offensive. They said, “You just got here, and you’re giving these white boys permission to think they’re right. You should just shut up.” They started a campaign of threatening me. If I sat next to them at lunch, they’d get up and walk away. I was completely iced out. I even got kicked out of the Black Student Union. They said, “If you come to another meeting, we’re going to have a problem.” And then all the slurs came. He’s an Uncle Tom. He’s just a Black mouth with white talking points. I’m very used to that now—if you call me those things, I don’t really care. But back then I felt like I was a horrible person, so I just bottled up all of my doubt. I basically had to neuter myself.\\n\\nOne of the things I started to notice while I was arguing my leftist points to my conservative friends—like about getting vaccinated, supporting Trump—they would just ask me a lot of questions. They wouldn’t get mad at me. One of the conservatives I hated the most was Tucker Carlson, but I finally listened to one of his most controversial takes—about white replacement theory, and immigration—and I thought, “Look, I want to hate the guy, but I can’t really disagree with what he’s saying.” I’d been told for so long not to go look at these sources because they’re racist, they’re regressive, they’re harmful. And actually, it turns out I’m left wanting more. That’s when I did a full factory reset. I tried to relearn things from the ground up.\\n\\nWhen I look at most of the young men in my life, a lot of them are very sheepish about what they believe. They hold their beliefs to themselves. And conservatives have to talk in a certain way so they don’t alienate you, they don’t polarize, they don’t make it seem as if they’re trying to disrespect you. They’re always on the back burner trying to defend themselves.\\n\\nA few weeks ago in class, we had a group assignment, and this one girl in our group—I knew she was a feminist, I knew she was a control freak, and I knew she was going to sink our grade. But none of the guys in my group, including me, wanted to tell her no about anything. We didn’t want to speak over her. You could tell we were subconsciously teaming up to protect her from the idea that we were trying to mansplain to her, or that we were trying to hurt her feelings. And when I talk to older men who are in the corporate world, they do the same thing.\\n\\nWe’re all holding ourselves back from our natural behavior. We’ve ceded so much power. Voting for Trump has made me more unyielding. I don’t necessarily care who I offend. I’m not doing it to harm you. I’m doing it because sometimes ideas have to offend people. They have to invoke some kind of passion. Out of all the hardest things someone can do in life, I think coming out of poverty is first. And then coming out of the progressive trap is probably second.\\n\\nThis article appeared in the March 2025 issue of Esquire\\n\\nsubscribe\\n\\nANIKAIT KONATALAPALLI\\n\\nStudent at St. Mary’s College, age 22\\n\\nMoraga, California\\n\\nSelf-Portrait by contributor\\n\\nI’m cisgender. I’m heterosexual. I’m not white, but I tick all the other categories that seem to form like the bad straw-man character on the Left, if you know what I mean. In these discourses you see on the Internet, on social media, you’ll have a lot of these left-wing influencers, these feminists just going on tirades against men—like, men are responsible for this, men are responsible for that, yada, yada, yada. Part of the reason why we’re experiencing a loneliness epidemic and we have all these crazy influencers like Andrew Tate out there is because we as a society, I think, have told men that they’re not valued and that whatever natural traits they exhibit are written off as toxic masculinity.\\n\\nWe’re told to express ourselves, be vulnerable—but then the moment we are vulnerable, we’re still judged. Like, “Why are you that vulnerable?” Or if you grew up in a really tough, traditional, machismo family, you’re told the exact opposite: Keep everything in. So you either keep everything in and let that balloon grow and grow until one day it pops, or you try to let some of it out, get judged, and then never do it again.\\n\\nI’m not one of those manosphere guys or anything like that, but for a long time I did feel like, as a guy, I was kind of being sidelined. There was a time in my life when I considered myself pretty liberal, but then just the way I’d get shut down if I had a viewpoint that was maybe a little different—like, on abortion, there was a time in high school when I genuinely didn’t know what abortion was because my Indian parents never talked about it. I learned about it in school when Roe v. Wade got overturned. This one girl who I grew up with, I asked her, “Oh, what’s abortion? I don’t know what that is.” And she was like, “It’s when a pregnancy gets terminated.” And I was like, “What do you mean terminated? The baby dies?” And she was like, “Yeah, basically.” And I was like, “Well, isn’t that murder? Why would someone want to do that?” And she got super mad at me. She actually threatened to hit me.\\n\\nI’m not one of those manosphere guys or anything like that, but for a long time I did feel like, as a guy, I was kind of being sidelined.\\n\\nI’m a child of immigrants, but you seem to get more benefits as an illegal migrant than if you’re a citizen here. They get housed in hotels, they get debit cards, and yet there’s so many veterans on the streets who don’t get any of it. Last summer I applied for this internship at a major investment firm on their portfolio-management team, and I clicked on this scholarship application where they’ll give $20,000 toward your tuition. And I got an offer for an accelerated interview. So I tell my dad about it—an accelerated interview at the biggest asset manager in the world! And he was like, “What do you mean ‘accelerated interview’? They only give those to marginalized communities—they only give those to people who are LGBT and Black and Hispanic and all that.” He said, “You should email them and tell them you’re not one of those.”\\n\\nSo I send an email. I tell them, “Hey, thank you for the offer, but I don’t think I should be interviewed in this way because I don’t fit into those categories.” They were like, “Okay, well, thanks for telling us.” And then a few weeks later, I got rejected. So my initial thought was like, Okay, so they were going to consider me because I ticked a few identity markers—but now that I don’t, they get rid of me? I still have this negative view of affirmative action because of it—because it’s like they were willing to lower the standard for me. It’s demeaning. And obviously you’re never going to be happy because—whether people say it out loud or not—you’ll always be seen as the guy who got in because there was a lower standard.\\n\\nI voted for Biden in 2020, and I voted for Trump in 2024. I didn’t like Trump back in 2020, and I still don’t really like him. He’s got the kind of persona that I despise—that kind of main character, center of the universe, got pampered a lot as a kid, all that. And he was definitely a sore loser in 2020. I voted against him in 2020 because I just didn’t like how the last four years went, the amount of polarization, the way he handled the pandemic. So I voted against him. And then this time I voted against Biden by voting for Trump.\\n\\nIt’s ridiculous the way the Left has portrayed Trump as this threat to democracy when they’ve done a lot of things that are just as bad. Like, it was obvious they couped against Biden, and it’s not like they had an open primary where other Democrats could run. They just put Kamala in there. Then Biden pardoned his son after he said he wouldn’t. I also think the Justice Department is politicized. Sure, maybe Trump has some legit cases against him, but why are they trying to fish for everything they can? I definitely admire his resilience. He’s got all these court cases on him, all these convictions, and yet he’s still out there campaigning like crazy. Trump’s also got, what, two assassination attempts on him? Not to mention the entire media machine being against him, the entire political machine being against him, even Republicans. And yet he’s out there winning.\\n\\nCARTER PLANTINGA\\n\\nPrelaw student at Boston University, age 22\\n\\nNashville, Tennessee\\n\\nSelf-Portrait by contributor\\n\\nThere’s a lot of talking points in the world right now about a male loneliness epidemic. And for the most part, I would venture to say the people who focus on it tend to be right-wing grifters trying to make a buck off of male rage. That being said, many of the young men in my life—certainly not all, I wouldn’t even say most, but way, way more than I’d think is normal—have no close friends. Like, they have guys they go out and drink with. But if something is weighing on you, if your mom is sick, I could probably name three or four men in my everyday life who would have no one in their lives to speak to about that.\\n\\nThat extends to their relationships with women. A disproportionate amount of the men in my life are single. I’m not a single guy, so I can’t speak to this personally, but I know there’s a lot of incel-\\xadadjacent bitterness around that fact. These guys have spent their entire adult lives single and have grown to resent women for that.\\n\\nMany of the young men in my life—certainly not all, I wouldn’t even say most, but way, way more than I’d think is normal—have no close friends.\\n\\nAnd it’s exacerbated when you go online, you go on YouTube and TikTok, and there are men reinforcing this idea that actually you’ve been right all along, you are right to be waiting for the “highest-value woman”—that’s what they call it—and every other woman who won’t date you, those women are bad. They’re sexually promiscuous, they’re ignorant, and you’re right to be angry at them. So many men are hearing this messaging and develop a sense of bitterness that drives them away from the women in their life—not just potential partners, but their mothers, their sisters.\\n\\nI try not to associate with people who harbor real bitterness for women, but I mean, I think about the way that some of them talk in my classes—men who take a gender-studies class just to dunk on the feminist talking points they hear. They view themselves as on some kind of crusade to be the logical voice of reason in the room. Like, in a moment of social reckoning, a moment of reorganization where there are more women in college than men, they view themselves as a last bastion, a final crusader in the quest to defend masculinity from an emasculating society.\\n\\nIt’s a really sad thing. It’s embarrassing to watch. And if you asked those men in those lectures what they’re so angry about, they’d say they’re mad that their side of the story is not being told, when in fact their side of the story is the most well-\\xadreported, well-documented, well-studied thing in the history of the world.\\n\\nMARKO BATKOVIC\\n\\nConstruction-management student at Cal State, Chico, age 22\\n\\nChico, California\\n\\nSelf-Portrait by contributor\\n\\nIn this election, it seemed like the Democrats were focusing on just women’s issues and women’s rights, we need a woman in office, everything just centered around women—and I am in no way degrading women, that’s fine—but they left out the entire other gender. There wasn’t anything for young men or pretty much men in general. It was just women’s this, women’s that. And for men, we’re like, “What about us?”\\n\\nThe problem with today’s society, and especially with my generation, is everyone just focuses on, “Oh, men have had this and men have had that over the course of history.” They’ve had better benefits or they’ve gotten paid more. And what about women? What about women’s equality? Which I’m not opposed to—I do feel like women should be paid equally. Although if that’s what we want, then women need to start integrating themselves in the jobs that men naturally do. You’re not going to see a woman doing tile work. There’s not a single woman on the job sites that I work in. There’s not a single woman working in the coal mines or the oil rigs. If we want to have an equal society, then women need to start doing these jobs.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, who Trump is as a person is not my concern. What he does in his daily life, his whole demeanor, is not reflective of my opinions.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, who Trump is as a person is not my concern. What he does in his daily life, the way that he acts, his whole demeanor, is not reflective of my opinions. It all goes back to what he will do to better the country. That’s what I’m concerned with—the things that affect my life. So his rants on Twitter and all that stuff, yeah, it’s stupid and I don’t agree with it. He should stop doing it. I mean, it’s kind of funny, but it’s also pretty stupid for a political leader to be ranting on Twitter like that. At the end of the day, though, it doesn’t affect me. What affects me is what he’s going to do for the country.\\n\\nAll these Democrats keep saying he’s going to be the fall of America, which is just an idiotic remark to make, because if he was the fall of America, it would’ve fallen already. We still have our democracy, we still have our freedoms, we still have our right to believe in our own values and religion and anything that you want to believe in. I feel like Democrats just have this hatred for Trump himself. They don’t have a problem with what we as Republicans believe in. They just hate Trump. During the four years he was president, all they did was try to indict him, impeach him, get him out of office. And the last few years, they’ve been trying to put him in jail. It’s been really shocking to see what they were doing to him. The Democrats are always preaching about, “Oh, he’s going to be the fall of democracy and the end of America.” Yet they’re the ones inciting a world where you can decide someone’s unfit to be president just because you don’t like them.\\n\\nHistory will speak for itself, though. Because at the end of the day, in 2030, in a hundred years, whatever, our kids are going to be reading about Trump in their history books. You don’t need to like him as a person, but it’s undeniable the impact he’s had on the country. Whether it’s George Washington or Barack Obama or Donald Trump, our kids in future generations are going to know their names.\"},\n",

Exodus, 23:1–2\\n\\n“I’m dedicating my life to being useful,” he says. “To my community, to my neighborhood, to my city. And to do that means letting go of some burdens of the past. Never forgetting, but forgiving. There is power in forgiving.”\\n\\nNORMAN JEAN ROY Salaam with his wife, Sanovia, and their son Yusef Jr. Note Salaam’s ring, which he designed himself to commemorate the exoneration.\\n\\nSpare a thought for the falsely accused. For the man sent to prison as a boy for something he didn’t do. Does anyone ever allow the reality of a false accusation to sink in and upset the equilibrium for even a moment, or is it just in and out and on to the next, like everything else? That accusation, after all, was leveled on our behalf. State power is derived from us. Justice is meant to make us whole. But what does an injustice do to us? When an innocent person serves a full prison sentence, gets out carrying the excruciating knowledge that justice is for other people and facts and innocence don’t matter when you’re a kid raised by your mom in an apartment on Fifth Avenue, uptown—Harlem, U. S. A. Spare a thought for the falsely accused.\\n\\nHe can’t walk down the street for getting stopped by people who have never met him but to whom he is famous. In this neighborhood, the man who was falsely accused is well-known. The elders have known him for decades, since he was a tall, skinny kid with a flattop, on the front page of all the papers. The city was coming apart in 1989—you could’ve lit the air with a match, the racial tension was that combustible. And the crime that he was accused of committing was so terrible that once he and his codefendants were identified to the public on the word of the police, the case was over before it even began. White victim, a young professional out for a jog in Central Park, raped and beaten nearly to death with a tree branch, three quarters of the blood in her body soaked into the ground. The accused were Black and brown, five of them, aged fourteen to sixteen, four confessing on videotape. What more is there to know? New York in the aftermath was a tinderbox, braying for justice, instead finding vengeance, which is supposed to belong only to God, according to God Himself.\\n\\nRead We are celebrating our 90th anniversary with a wildly ambitious package called The Next 90. Learn more about it, as well as Esquire’s living legacy, in this letter from Editor-in-Chief Michael Sebastian.\\n\\nA local man who had inherited a real estate fortune even took out full-page ads in all the local papers calling for the state to bring back the death penalty, writing: “What has happened to the respect for authority, the fear of retribution by the courts, society and the police for those who break the law . . . ?”\\n\\nBut that was a lifetime ago, and so some others here in Harlem seem to recognize the falsely accused man not as Yusef Salaam of the Central Park Five but as Yusef Salaam, current candidate for public office, running to represent Harlem on the New York City Council. He’s not yet even in office, but the expectation invested in him is daunting. On the street, Harlemites are taking him in, greeting him with broad smiles and queuing up for selfies, bumping elbows and shaking hands, happy that this gracious man of forty- nine has not only come through the time the state stole from him without bitterness but has agreed to be a voice for the ambitions, grievances, and despair of this beautiful, historic, and desperate neighborhood in America’s largest city. He has a ready smile and a welcoming face. “Blessings, blessings, blessings!” he will greet old friends and new. As a politician, he is a complete novice, but for the retail politicking that is the bedrock of democracy—hearing from people on the street where they live—he has a natural gift. He is inexperienced enough at the game that he will stay and talk until you’re done with him. And a city-council district may be democracy in its purest form—big enough to require a proper campaign in order to prove your worth, small enough that an officeholder, especially a rookie, might legitimately feel responsible for every soul and pothole in it.\\n\\nSalaam likens any neighborhood to a human body, and each of us to cells in the body—if you put healthy, nutritious food into a body and take care to educate the mind, do things in moderation and get good rest, the body will be functioning, flourishing, and happy. If you eat badly or partake in unhealthy habits, do drugs or sleep irregularly, then the body gets sick. Dies. It’s not a bad metaphor for how society works, and it allows for just how interdependent we actually are much more than our current politics does. If some of us are left out or are doing poorly, the health of all of society is put at risk.\\n\\nThe needs of this body, of Salaam’s neighborhood, are intense. And as he makes his way up and down its streets, from all sides, his fellow Harlemites come to him:\\n\\n“You know how long it’s been since the senior center had a coat of paint?” says a man holding a cue stick at the Lieutenant Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Center. “And we sure could use another pool table—gives people a place to gather in the evenings. . . .”\\n\\nNORMAN JEAN ROY\\n\\nThis article appeared in the 90th Anniversary issue of Esquire\\n\\nsubscribe\\n\\nA woman buttonholes him at a community meeting at Graham Court, a Gilded Age gem on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard that has seen better days: “What are you going to do about the defecation and the urination that goes on outside my front door?!”\\n\\n“I applied for affordable housing, but affordable housing ain’t affordable!” says a man who stops him on 135th Street and comes in for a hug. “We need a two-bedroom, and they’ve had us in a studio for twenty years! . . . I sound Black, right?” He is Asian, and points this out by circling his face with his index finger. “People here don’t look like me, but they sure live like me.” He complains to Salaam about the conduct of corrections officers. “But they just scared. I don’t talk from no textbook—I did fifteen years.” As Salaam begins to walk away to his next appointment, the man reaches out for his hand and issues a plea: “You’ve come too far. Don’t sell yourself out.”\\n\\nAn older woman on 110th Street stops short of asking for his attention, instead holding back as he speaks to a small cluster of people. Her eyes brimming with tears, she clutches your arm and shakes it gently. “I just can’t get over how much time he lost,” she says. “They are so hard on our men.”\\n\\nYou point to him and say that Salaam somehow seems unbroken by an experience that might well have destroyed him—publicly vilified at fifteen, wrongfully convicted at sixteen, imprisoned for almost seven years in appalling conditions upstate, on parole for three years, required to register as a sex offender for another three. She dabs her eyes with a tissue and shakes her head hopefully.\\n\\nEvery concern, every conceivable “issue” that a human life encounters finds its way to Salaam on these streets—hunger, housing security, economic insecurity, public safety, public health, lousy landlords, race discrimination, the human capacity to produce trash, the human tendency to triple- park, for starters.\\n\\nSpare a thought for the city-council candidate. We drive from Central Harlem down toward his old neighborhood at the northeast corner of Central Park, and Salaam is careful not to go a tick over the speed limit. He’s been pulled over during the campaign and is very mindful not to give anyone any excuse to interrupt his peaceful movements. He pulls into a parking space on 110th Street across from Central Park, not a hundred yards from the building he lived in growing up, just a few hundred yards from the spot in the park where the state said he had committed the crime that altered the course of his life. Salaam hops out of the car and walks around to the passenger side, opens the door for his mother, a soft-spoken woman of regal bearing with shoulder-length salt-and-pepper dreadlocks, who steps out onto the sidewalk, into the neighborhood that her son will soon represent on the New York City Council. Yusef starts to walk his mother in the direction of home when a young man, slight and intense and wearing a backpack, approaches him.\\n\\n“Excuse me,” the young man says. “You’re running for office?”\\n\\n“Yes,” Salaam says. “I recently won the Democratic primary.” He smiles. “And my opponent in November is apathy.”\\n\\n“His opponent in November is Write In,” his mother corrects.\\n\\n“Okay, great,” says the young man. “Let me ask you—what’s the . . . what’s the point?”\\n\\nSalaam hesitates for just a moment, uncomprehending. “The point of . . .” He leans forward toward the man, as if trying to better pick up his signal. “. . . running for office?\\n\\n“No,” the young man answers. “I’m out here every two and four years, and I listen to all of you, and I just need to know What’s the point?” He flashes a brilliant smile and projects a crackling energy. There’s a touch of violence in his eyes. In this moment, though, he is intently waiting for an answer.\\n\\n“Well,” Salaam says, “I believe that in this neighborhood we hold great power that we have never fully exercised. We are too busy dividing ourselves, going after each other—”\\n\\nThe young man interrupts. “We play by their rules—they play by no rules,” he says. “Oh, they go on about their rules and their Constitution, but when it comes to keeping n***ers down, they just make it up as they go!”\\n\\n“Okay, okay,” Salaam says. “Now, I know something about them keeping us down.”\\n\\nIt is pretty clear that the young man doesn’t know who Salaam is. He looks to be about thirty, and although he grew up in Harlem, he likely wasn’t yet born when Salaam was sent to prison. He interrupts again.\\n\\n“I’m sure you’ve been through some things,” he says. “Well, I’ve experienced some things, too.”\\n\\nThe air between them bristles.\\n\\n“Tell me about your life, brother,” Salaam says.\\n\\nThe young man has a wide view and is well versed in politics, local and national—and he speaks urgently. He also has a specific issue. He sells weed, is an “entrepreneur,” and has been paying keen attention to the city’s pronouncements and actions, as over the past two years, Harlem has steadily filled with smoke shops that are killing his business. “I’m trying to figure out why outsiders are now selling legal marijuana on our streets. These shops aren’t licensed and could be a danger to the public. I want to participate in the legit economy, but these motherfuckers . . .”\\n\\nSalaam has been watching the young man closely as he flashes rage with his eyes and immediately takes it back with his smile. An astonishing dynamic is emerging on this sidewalk in Harlem. Yusef Salaam, who had every reason to give up on society, or “the system,” or America, is straining to prevent the young man from doing the same. And the young man, well, he is desperate for a reason to believe and is not yet sure that he is finding it.\\n\\n“Brother, we are trapped inside of someone else’s hundred-year plan,” Salaam says. “The only way to break out of it and make our own plan is together. The only thing I know is that we as a community have never used our power—”\\n\\n“Is there a we?!” the young man snaps. “Am I a we?” He flashes that smile as he looks inward, momentarily amused by the wordplay. “Who are we?”\\n\\nAnd then he drops the smile and levels his gaze. “Because I’m not playing—I’m ready to burn this motherfucker down. What is the strategy, and why should I give a shit in the first place? Why be involved?”\\n\\nSalaam: Because I know enough from when the spike wheels of “justice” ran over me and my family thirty-four years ago that if we are not involved and in numbers, and using our voice to change the world, then they will use our voices against us. Brother, you have to trust me when I say that divided, we won’t stand a chance.\\n\\nYoung man [more urgently this time]: Hear me out. Do we have to burn it down, or what kind of political changes you talking about?\\n\\nSalaam: I’m not a politician, brother.\\n\\nYoung man: Then what are you?\\n\\nSalaam: I’m you.\\n\\nNORMAN JEAN ROY The future councilman in Harlem. “There was a saying in my neighborhood: When the cops come looking for you, any n-i-g-g-e-r will do.” He is careful to spell out the word.\\n\\nThere were twenty boys rampaging in the park that night.\\n\\nThere were thirty-two. There were forty.\\n\\nIt was the Central Park Ten.\\n\\nThe Central Park Six.\\n\\nThe Central Park Five.\\n\\nThere was “plenty of physical evidence” linking the five to the attack.\\n\\nThere was no physical evidence linking any of the five to the attack.\\n\\nThe police interrogations were conducted by the book.\\n\\nThe defendants were coached, their confessions were coerced, and they were told that if they just admitted involvement in the jogger attack, they could go home.\\n\\nFor a case that has now been closed twice, there remains a lot in dispute. Well, maybe better to say that some very powerful people cling to a version of events that has since been abandoned as untrue. What is now clear is that the convictions of the Central Park Five were won in spite of grievous flaws in the evidence—perhaps it’s better to say in spite of a grievous lack of evidence. Because what is also now clear is that there was physical or biological evidence connecting only one person to the assault on the jogger that night—a person not among the five defendants. For that night in April 1989, there is no reliable accounting for exactly where those five teenagers were and when, nor exactly what they may or may not have been doing. Maybe better just to say that the Central Park Five didn’t commit the terrible crime for which they were convicted.\\n\\nWhat is not disputed is that on the night of April 19, 1989, a young investment banker named Trisha Meili was out for a run in Central Park when she was attacked, raped, viciously beaten, and left for dead in the bushes three hundred feet from the park’s 102nd Street crossover. Unconscious and near death, she would be found by passersby at 1:30 a.m.\\n\\nEarlier that evening, witnesses would tell police that some kids had been assaulting pedestrians near the Central Park reservoir, several blocks south. In response, cops had flooded the park and hauled a large group of teen–agers to the precinct located at the center of Central Park. Among them were fourteen-year-old Raymond Santana and fourteen-year-old Kevin Richardson, who did not know each other. The boys were expecting to be sent home when Meili’s near-lifeless body was found. A call from a detective at Metropolitan Hospital would stop their release and mark the beginning of a legal and social nightmare that would come to be recognized as one of the most shameful failures in the history of American justice.\\n\\nThe next day, April 20, based on descriptions from the boys already in custody, fifteen-year-old Antron McCray was also questioned by police. No one seems to know for sure how the police came to be looking for Yusef Salaam, but it seems that the cops had a description of another boy—tall kid with a flattop—that sounded like Yusef.\\n\\nSalaam’s brother Shareef had heard that the police were looking for his brother and begged him not to go outside that afternoon. Salaam’s sister, Aisha, remembers that Shareef, who was bigger than his older brother, wrestled Yusef to the floor to keep him from leaving the apartment. “Aisha!” Yusef yelled. “Get him off of me!” Shareef finally let go of his brother, and Aisha and Yusef took the elevator down to the lobby, where they ran into Yusef’s friend Korey Wise, sixteen, who also lived in the building. The building security guard told them that at least three police officers had just taken the elevator up to the Salaam apartment.\\n\\nAisha is the oldest of the siblings and says she thought that if she could just talk to the police, they’d understand their mistake. Her brother was a placid young man, averse to physical confrontations, she says. When a mugger once demanded his money, he emptied his pockets without hesitation. Another time, when Yusef was on his bike and a thief approached him and said, “Get off,” Yusef got off.\\n\\n“Let’s go up and talk to them,” Aisha Salaam remembers telling her brother. Korey Wise went upstairs with his friend and offered to go with Yusef to the precinct to keep him company. Those five—Santana, Richardson, McCray, Salaam, and Wise —would become the Central Park Five.\\n\\nWhen the police came for Yusef on the evening following the rape and beating of Trisha Meili, they knocked on his apartment door on the twenty- first floor of 1309 Fifth Avenue. Shareef Salaam answered the door in his underwear. Get dressed, you’re coming with us, they told him. What? Why? the confused teenager asked the cops. Are you Yusef Salaam? they asked. That’s my brother, he said. And that, Yusef Salaam says, is how close his brother came to also being a member of the Central Park Five.\\n\\n“There was a saying in my neighborhood,” Salaam tells me. “When the cops come looking for you, any n-i-g-g-e-r will do,” taking care to spell the word rather than say it.\\n\\nSharonne Salaam was a single mother who taught fashion design at Parsons School of Design in Greenwich Village. When she got home from work that evening, Aisha and Shareef were both hysterical that the police had taken Yusef in for questioning in connection with the crime that was exploding in the news across the city that day. Sharonne at first thought they were joking. She walked through the apartment, looking in closets and under beds. Okay, that’s enough—you can come out now. When she realized that her oldest son really wasn’t there, Sharonne sat Aisha and Shareef down and said, Calm down and tell me the full story again, from the beginning.\\n\\n“I was a pariah. They said I was born a mistake. I’m not a mistake,” Salaam tells me. “And I think that what I have been through gives me perspective on what people go through in life. I never thought about politics or holding elective office until recently, but I feel that this—I guess you might call it empathy—will be helpful to me as I serve my community. If, as Nietzsche says, you can find the why, then you can live any how. We all need a reason to live. This is mine. I was supposed to go through what I went through.”\\n\\nWe are sitting alone in a cluttered little office on 135th Street—a local Democratic club that doubles as his campaign office. There are mismatched photographs of past club officers on the wall, the flooring is peeling, and campaign literature is piled haphazardly on every surface. It was from here that Salaam took on and defeated two establishment candidates in the primary for his council seat. He now has a fully germinated idea of how his story fits into the larger story of loss and struggle and perseverance that defines the Black experience in this town and in this country, and he speaks it in full paragraphs, only occasionally lapsing into the rote poetry of the motivational speaker he now is. “For Black Americans, robbed of our names, our culture, our God, it is just a short step further to lose your mind, too,” he says. “But what if a person doesn’t lose his mind? What if a person instead taps back into the memory in Sankofa, which is the sacred knowledge from your past that enables you to live in your present?”\\n\\nHe takes special meaning and great comfort from this African concept—Sankofa—of looking back to live forward. With meaning comes purpose, with purpose comes acceptance. So that in part explains how he came through the fire, as his uncle Frank describes the experience. Many people never come through it but instead are consumed by it. The other part was the unstinting support of his mother, his grandmother, his siblings, and his uncle, who is a father figure. Without their belief, he says, he may well have lost his own.\\n\\nIt was Salaam’s grandmother who told him to find meaning in the tribulation. She told him, “Yusef, I don’t know why they’re doing this to you, but be still and listen.” When he was in prison, she wrote to him every week, addressing the letters to “Master Yusef Salaam,” because she wanted whoever processed the letters to know that her grandson was somebody.\\n\\nIt was Salaam’s mother who made sure that he did not confess on videotape, and he was the only one of the five who didn’t. It was Salaam’s mother who repeatedly refused consent for police to question Yusef. It was Salaam’s mother who insisted instead that her son be given an attorney and who told him to stop talking to investigators immediately. “She told me: ‘You will not participate in your own destruction,’ ” Salaam says. “They were breaking us down. They would have broken me, too, without my mother.”\\n\\nAfter his conviction, his mother would keep vigil at the prison, making the trip upstate from the city once or twice a week for the entire six years and eight months that he was incarcerated—to Dannemora, Harlem Valley, wherever they moved him to. She would often switch the days of the week so as to disrupt routine—a sort of surprise inspection, so that prison staff would never know for sure when she might show up. “It was the only way to make sure he stayed alive,” she says. “I had to keep Yusef alive.”\\n\\nIt was his mother who would call him in 2002 to tell him that the person who had actually committed the crime for which he was convicted—a serial rapist and killer named Matias Reyes—had confessed to the rape and assault of Trisha Meili. By then, Salaam was living in Stone Mountain, Georgia, trying with difficulty to put together some kind of life. Reyes had found Jesus, she told her son. Knew details only a crime’s perpetrator would know. The swabs taken from the victim that night so long ago had immediately matched Reyes’s DNA. Sharonne Salaam delivered this news, and then they both sat in stunned silence on the phone for what seemed like a long time.\\n\\nSpare a thought for the mother of the falsely accused.\\n\\nThe young man’s eyes narrow as he processes what Salaam has just said: “The spike wheels of justice ran over your family?” His eyes widen as the identity of the man he’s talking to dawns on him. Not fifty yards from where we stand there is now an entrance to Central Park called the Gate of the Exonerated, dedicated last year as a monument to the falsely accused men, and as an admonition to the unwritten future to do better than we have done. It also stands in stone as a reminder that even in a time defined by our seeming inability to acknowledge error, extend grace, apologize to each other, and correct course, lost truths can still be found and long-delayed justice is not always justice denied. The young man’s shoulders soften, the brilliant smile takes over his face, and he offers Salaam his hand but instead comes in for a hug. If Salaam has reason for hope, the young man seems to concede, how insurmountable could his grievances be?\\n\\nThe young man walks into the afternoon, and Salaam stands on the street in his old neighborhood, thinking of the exchange and of the challenge of persuading others to believe in a system from which they feel estranged. If anyone understands that, it is Salaam. No one in a position of power and direct responsibility for his indictment, conviction, and imprisonment has apologized or even acknowledged error. When the prosecutor who oversaw the case against the Central Park Five heard of Reyes’s confession and the conclusive evidence of his guilt, she said, “I think Reyes ran with that pack of kids. He stayed longer when the others moved on. He completed the assault. I don’t think there is a question in the minds of anyone present during the interrogation process that these five men were participants not only in the other attacks that night, but in the attack on the jogger.”\\n\\nThe New York police commissioner ordered a review of the investigation, and the resulting report found the department blameless, asserting despite a paucity of evidence that “it is more likely than not that the defendants participated in an attack upon the jogger.” As if “more likely than not” were an acceptable standard of criminal justice anywhere anyone would want to live.\\n\\nWhen asked if he regretted placing the ads in all the local papers calling for the death penalty in the wake of the attack, ads that contributed to the toxic atmosphere in New York City and potentially compromised the defendants’ ability to receive fair trials, that real estate heir, Donald Trump, who by then was president of the United States, declined to apologize, saying, “They admitted their guilt.”\\n\\nSpeaking about this ignominious record, Salaam is encyclopedic. The people who are vested in the false accusation are, he thinks, also the people who remain vested in the notion that it is simply inevitable that people who look like him must eventually wind up in the system. The deference to prison is still that powerful. And it is that matrix that he believes must be broken. Yusef Salaam’s time on earth puts him at the nexus of many things that have come to define American life—our never-healing racial wound, our deeply ingrained antipathy between police and communities of color, and, in the most promising instance, our response to the revanchism of the Trump-led reversion to our worst impulses—in the stubborn hope that we can be and do better by participation in public life.\\n\\nSalaam is surprisingly light and free of rancor. Appreciates complexity and nuance in an era not known for either. As a budding public servant, for instance, he believes in the police. “We can all be victims of crime,” he says. “Some of us are also victims of the police. That doesn’t mean all policing is bad. It means that we need better policing. I know in an intimate way the cops who get away with doing bad things by saying that they were just doing their job—they were not just doing their job.”\\n\\nHe doesn’t seem to relish obvious opportunities to settle scores. When asked for a reaction earlier this year after former president Trump was criminally indicted in New York City, Salaam offered a simple one-word response: “Karma.”\\n\\nAs he stands here on his mother’s street, he contemplates what it might mean to absolve those who resist responsibility for their actions. What does an injustice do to us? The state has the power to condemn, to absolve, to forgive on behalf of society, the people, us. But whose power is it to forgive a recalcitrant state when the state doesn’t possess the grace or wisdom to even seek forgiveness?\\n\\nIt is a supreme irony of our time that that power belongs to the powerless, to the wronged, to the falsely accused and imprisoned. It belongs to the victims of misused state power. It belongs to Yusef Salaam. It is the most aggrieved who must, it seems, also be the most gracious.\\n\\nSalaam raises his arms and opens his hands, as if releasing something into the New York sky. “I have had to learn how to forgive. It is the only way I know to repair myself. I have to forgive Donald Trump,” he says, gesturing down Fifth Avenue. “I forgive the prosecutors . . . I forgive the police . . . I forgive those who have threatened me and who told me to watch my back forever. I forgive. I forgive. I forgive.”\\n\\n\\n\\nStory: Mark Warren\\n\\nPhotos: Norman Jean Roy\\n\\nStyling: Bill Mullen\\n\\nProduction: Danelle Manthey at Somersault Productions\\n\\nProduction Design: Michael Sturgeon\\n\\nTailoring: Joseph Ting\\n\\nCreative Direction: Nick Sullivan\\n\\nDesign Direction: Rockwell Harwood\\n\\nVisuals Direction: Justin O'Neill\\n\\nExecutive Producer, Video: Dorenna Newton\"},\n",

Submit your own questions to Prudie here.\\n\\nDear Prudence,\\n\\nI’m recently engaged to the most honest, thoughtful, and loving man I’ve ever met. He has supported me through many hard times, including losing my job and being assaulted. Here’s the but about him: He makes no money. He has ambitions, and he’s smart, but will likely only bring a middle-class income at best. I have an OK job and I’m self-sufficient. Now here’s the but about me: I’m really, really pretty. My whole life people have told me I could get any man I want, meaning a rich man, and they are now shocked that I’m engaged to my fiancé, nice though he is. I’ve never dated a rich man, but it does make me curious. So part of me thinks I’m squandering my good looks on this poor man, and the other part of me thinks that I’m so shallow that I don’t even deserve him or anyone else. Am I a fool for thinking that a poor man can make me happy, or an idiot for believing a sexist fantasy?\\n\\n—Sincerely Shallow\\n\\nDear Sincerely,\\n\\nIt’s a delicate thing to sing “I Feel Pretty” and keep the audience charmed. Many people will be repelled by your acknowledged superficiality and wish that a string of rich men use you, then dump you when you start to lose your looks. But surely your fiancé delights in the fact—and surely his friends have noted—that he’s nabbed one the prettiest girls in the room. When considering possible life partners, people should bluntly assess each other’s intangible and tangible qualities. Of course character is central, but if the person you’re dating is a wholly admirable person who doesn’t attract you physically, that’s a serious problem. So, too, is being with someone who gives you pleasure in and out of bed, but who’s hiding from creditors. You have asked an unattractive question about monetizing your beauty. But I think there’s a more accurate way to look at what’s troubling you.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nYou’re really wondering whether you can be happy in the long run with a guy who treats you great, but who’ll never satisfy you financially. “Middle class” is a very elastic term, but I assume you mean that while you and your fiancé will be able to meet your basic needs, you’ll mostly be living paycheck to paycheck. You say he’s smart and ambitious, and I’m assuming you both are young, so you haven’t made it clear why these two qualities can’t propel him further professionally. Maybe he’s prone to pipe dreams the marketplace rewards with minimum wage. It’s fair to want a fully contributing partner in life, but if you think the bulk of a couple’s earning should come from the man, you either need to re-examine your assumptions, or clue in your fiancé. You and he need to discuss what kind of life you’d both like to lead and how each of you can map out career choices that will make this possible. Of course there are no guarantees of financial success, just as there are no guarantees that good looks will lure a guy with a bulging wallet (or that he’ll stick with you into middle-age). But if you’re filled with dread over the certainty that marrying your boyfriend will consign you to forever dreading when the bills come, this will tarnish your perception of his sterling qualities. You’re not a shallow fool for thinking that a life of scraping by won’t be so pretty.\\n\\n—Emily Yoffee\\n\\nFrom: Sexy and I Know It.

After breast-feeding a few kids, they are not so discreet and tiny anymore, and frankly I’m not very happy with the new bulkier look. I used to be a small B, now I’m a solid C. My husband likes them like this, but I feel suffocated by his attention to them. Anything that is not a turtleneck gets the once-over and basically a passive-aggressive comment like, “You feel OK wearing that top?” At which point I generally say I do, sometimes asking him if he thinks it’s too flashy and he reassures me that it’s OK as long as I feel OK. At this point I go change because I don’t want him thinking I’m trying to flash his mom at the family lunch or something. What can I do to get him off my back—err, chest? I’m modest, but I’m getting fed up with feeling like I never manage to dress appropriately.\\n\\n—Fashion Problems\\n\\nDear Fashion Problems,\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSo he’s thrilled with your expansion, but is also strangely unsupportive of it. If I’m understanding you right, it sounds as if he wants to keep your cup size a family secret (or two family secrets). A healthy interest in and pleasure in each other’s bodies is good for a marriage. An obsession over one body part isn’t. From now on, instead of slinking away and changing, stand firm. Explain you’re a grown woman and you don’t want to hear undermining commentary every time you wear an outfit that is two steps away from a burqa. I hope your change in attitude has him looking at you like a deer caught in the headlights. As for you, there are a lot of physical changes women undergo because of childbirth. But instead of bemoaning your enhanced state, accept that yours is a development many women would envy.\\n\\n—E.Y.\\n\\nFrom: Trophy Cups. (April 22, 2013)\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDear Prudence,\\n\\nI plan to be married soon. My fiancé and I don’t want a big to-do but would like to mark the occasion with a small ceremony and invite immediate family and a few close friends. This is a second marriage for both of us. My ex-husband and I remained civil to one another for the sake of our children. Once the hurt of our failed marriage had healed, we developed a friendship based on mutual interests and shared history. My fiancé and my ex get along well, and we occasionally socialize with him and his significant other. My ex is a judge and as such is able to perform weddings. My fiancé and I talked it over and would like to ask him to marry us. We haven’t asked him yet and aren’t sure he will agree, but we want to extend the invitation. The problem is that when I mentioned our plan to my sisters, they had a fit. They said it would be tacky and would make other family members uncomfortable to have my ex marry us. I know it’s an unusual situation, but it is also something we’d really like to do. Are our plans just too “out there”?\\n\\n— I Want My Ex to Officiate My Wedding\\n\\nDear Ex to Officiate,\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI’m all for formers getting along, especially when there are children involved. I’m also for intimate, low-key wedding ceremonies, especially when they are the second time around. But even if I disagree with your sisters throwing a fit, I agree with their point that it will take away from the sweetness of the moment if your loved ones are thinking that when your officiant gets to, “By the powers vested in me,” he might add, “it is with great relief that I say thank goodness she’s yours and not mine.” You do not want the moment that you two are being joined to be accompanied by mass eye-rolling and elbows to the ribs by those in attendance. It’s fine if your ex and his girlfriend attend the ceremony, but surely you and your fiancé can find a mutually agreeable person to preside over your wedding who does not also have carnal knowledge of either of you.\\n\\n—E.Y.\\n\\nFrom Ex-change of Vows. (March 11, 2013)\\n\\nMore Advice From Slate\\n\\nOur son is getting married this fall. He and his fiancé are mad about each other, as you would hope for your child. Our future daughter-in-law is smart, cute and delightful—but only when she feels like it. For example, we threw a shower, and I wrapped in a keepsake box of mementos from my son’s childhood; art and trinkets that I have held over the years. It was, for me, a deeply sentimental gift. She opened it, and made a comment about making her hold on to all this stuff so I didn’t have to anymore.\"},\n",

       "   'content': 'Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\\n\\nMy first pimple was a defining moment in my life. I recall feeling confused as to why something dreaded by teenagers was happening to me, a 9-year-old. That first pimple soon became my first breakout. From there, my skin never cleared up, despite spending a decade in and out of dermatology offices.\\n\\nDuring one of those doctor appointments, I was given antibiotics for my acne. According to my dermatologist, the constellation of zits that marred my face was likely an overgrowth of the bacterium Cutibacterium acne. It’s well known that C. acnes play a key role in acne, so antibiotics to fight the bacterium seemed like the logical solution. We started with topical creams, which helped at first. Once those stopped working, potent oral antibiotics followed. No matter the treatment, the outcome was always the same: temporary improvement, only for the pimples to return with a vengeance.\\n\\nBy my mid-20s, it was clear that the acne was more than a lingering symptom of puberty; it was a chronic condition. I was facing the harsh reality that modern skin care may never give me a clear complexion.\\n\\nThat was also the time when I started my Ph.D. in food microbiology and was developing a deeper appreciation of bacterial systems. Naturally, I turned to examining my acne—and its refusal to leave my face—through the lens of a microbiologist. As it turns out, people blessed with healthy skin have comparable amounts of the bacteria C. acnes to those with acne. The devil’s in the details when we examine strain-level differences: acne-prone individuals tend to have a greater diversity of C. acnes strains—and that diversity includes more pathogenic strains.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMuch to my chagrin, I learned there is a link between antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity, meaning that the C. acnes strains that are antibiotic-resistant are the same strains causing aggressive breakouts. This explains why antibiotics failed me time and time again: They selected for the resistant and hypervirulent strains of C. acnes. While they could briefly quell the bacterium on my face, the resistant strains just ended up taking over.\\n\\nAs a zit-faced grad student, I started a new research project that used lactic acid bacteria, or LAB, as a method for food safety. Basically, the idea was to explore how LAB could be used to colonize a food environment in order to prevent the outgrowth of spoilage or pathogenic bacteria. This is what’s known as a “protective culture”: we collaborate with good microbes in order to keep bad microbes—and foodborne illness—away. It’s the microbial approach to “the enemy of my enemy is my friend”; a strategic alliance that acknowledges not all bacteria are bad. Sometimes, we just want to create an environment with our preferred microbial population.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSpending long hours reading research on LAB amid a particularly disheartening breakout, I became fixated on the idea that the key to clearer skin lay in the strategic inclusion of beneficial bacteria through probiotics rather than the indiscriminate eradication of bacteria through broad-spectrum antibiotics.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAssuming a bloom of virulent C. acnes was to blame, I hypothesized that recolonizing my skin microbiota with probiotic LAB could effectively treat my acne.\\n\\nIt’s worth mentioning that LAB is an umbrella term for a group of bacteria that share certain characteristics, with the most notable being their ability to produce lactic acid. While not all LAB are classified as probiotics, LAB are the most commonly used probiotics in food products. In fact, yogurt, one of the most well-known probiotic foods, is a product of the LAB Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, which convert lactose (the sugar in milk) into lactic acid.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGiven yogurt’s well-established ties to gut health, I wondered if its probiotic effect was transferable to my skin microbiome. Interestingly, in 1912, a scientist named Dr. J. Peyri documented Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the first topical probiotic studied for skin diseases in a paper titled “Topical Bacteriotherapy of the Skin.”\\n\\nSo, channeling Peyri, I embarked on a borderline socially unacceptable experiment where I smeared yogurt on my face in the name of science.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMy approach was simple: I applied plain yogurt on my face twice a day for roughly a month. I stuck with plain yogurt, avoiding flavored products containing added sugars, due to the potential link between high-glycemic diets and acne. While I wasn’t particular about brands, my main criterion was that the label indicated “live cultures,” which means that each gram contained at least 10 million LAB cells.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe results were outstanding. For the first time since childhood, I was acne-free.\\n\\nI felt like I won the Nobel Prize for pimple science. Excited to share my findings with my sister-in-law, a fellow woman in STEM, I anticipated an enthusiastic discussion about microbiome science. Not wanting to burst my bubble, she gently informed me that yogurt face masks have been a natural remedy in India for generations. It turns out that what I saw as a microbiology breakthrough was just common sense in Ayurvedic practice.\\n\\nIn fact, countless sources praise yogurt for its skin care benefits, citing everything from lactic acid’s gentle exfoliation effects to its probiotic properties. Studies support these claims, showing that probiotics like Lactobacillus can help with acne by producing antibacterial compounds that inhibit C. acnes and by reducing inflammation. A clinical study out of Srinakharinwirot University’s Medical School found that a probiotic lotion derived from Lactobacillus decreased both the abundance of C. acnes and inflammatory lesions in patients with mild to moderate acne, with effects lasting up to four weeks.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nRelated From Slate One of the Great Secret-Ingredient Mysteries of Our Time Has Finally Been Solved Read More\\n\\nIn other words, I wasn’t reinventing the wheel; I was simply adding to the existing body of evidence. Ironically, years of dermatology visits and pricey serums hadn’t managed what a $3 tub of yogurt did in weeks.\\n\\nMuch like my first pimple was a defining moment in my childhood, my 20s were split into two eras: what I now call pre-yogurt face and post-yogurt face. Years later, I still apply yogurt to my face—though now, in maintenance mode, I do it just once or twice a week instead of twice a day.\\n\\nWith my acne finally under control, my focus has shifted.

Submit questions here.\\n\\nDear Prudence,\\n\\nMy wife and I can’t decide how to share the news of our pregnancy with friends. We’re more than halfway to term, and she is still treating it like a state secret. As a result, I feel like I’m holding a big part of my life back from everyone I catch up with. I understand her argument: Every pregnancy has risks, and what could be more personal? At the same time, the vow of silence is making me feel isolated. Where’s the middle ground?\\n\\n—Bun in the Oven\\n\\nDear Bun in the Oven,\\n\\nYour wife’s anxieties about going public about the pregnancy are understandable, and there are a few ways other couples have handled this. Some couples pick a “low-stakes” friend—someone you trust, but also someone whom you don’t have major personal ties with—to “try out” what it feels like to share the news. Sometimes, couples will even tell random strangers first! (A co-worker once told me the news about his wife’s early pregnancy, and we both had a laugh about it because, as he explained, “Well, you’re kind of a rando!”)\\n\\nSo I think what would be a good middle ground for you and your wife is to each pick one person in your outer circle for each of you to confide in. In circumstances like these, outer circle friends/contacts are wonderful in how straightforward your relationships are; there aren’t any major expectations or emotional ties that would complicate what is simply joyful news. Good candidates include: long-distance friends, old friends from college or childhood whom you don’t see regularly, your work lunch buddy, and a medium friend from book club or the recreational soccer league.\\n\\nIdeally, your wife would pick someone who’s experienced pregnancy before, and you would pick someone who’s experienced parenthood before as well, so that you can both commiserate a little with your confidantes as the pregnancy progresses—it can be a lonely and nerve-wracking time for everyone. What your wife needs are some mom pals who know what she’s going through—so I would put that front and center when you pitch this idea to her. It’s not just about sharing big news, but about widening both of your circles of support.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGet advice from Prudie—submit a question!

Recently, I met a really great guy but I kept getting paranoid that he wanted something more, even though he told me twice that he understood I only wanted a friendship. This scared him and we talked about it in person afterward but he can’t be friends with me now. I feel like I am shutting down all the guy friends in my life and it’s really messing with me emotionally. What do I do?\\n\\n—Pushing Them Away\\n\\nDear Away,\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nYour letter didn’t mention your age, but I’m operating under the assumption that you’re fairly young (mostly judging from your use of “messing with me”). Friendships between men and women can be fraught at any age (it’s even the central thesis of the iconic rom-com When Harry Met Sally), but I do think they can be especially tricky to figure out in your teens and 20s. As you get older, you just get a lot more practice setting boundaries with people and figuring out who seems genuinely interested in getting to know you, versus who’s “settling” for friendship when they actually have romantic intentions in mind.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIf you’re in early adulthood, some of this will simply be a waiting game while everyone grows up a little. But also, regardless of age, I think the best solution for anyone in this situation is to get a lot of practice at taking friendships slowly.\\n\\nWhat I mean by that is: Be judicious about how much time you spend hanging out, how often you hang out, and under what circumstances (i.e. going to the bar versus having coffee). Avoid over-relying on these friends for support, and definitely avoid “trauma-dumping,” or getting too emotionally intimate about your personal life and past, especially if you have known someone for less than a year. Think of this stage of early friendship as a kind of audition or job interview: You want to make sure they can handle the basic stuff (showing up, respecting boundaries, bonding over shared interests) before they are granted access to the company secrets (more of your time, energy, or emotional intimacy).\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI think the reason you feel emotionally wrecked when a friend isn’t who they appear to be is because you’ve already gotten quite close to them at that point, so it messes with your mind. To prevent that, I think you just need to establish a basic measure of distance between yourself and any friendship that hasn’t yet earned your total trust. I don’t think you need to cut off all your male friends or stop making new ones entirely, but I do think you need to hold men (but also, any new friends) at an arm’s length until they’ve been able to prove that their intentions align with their actions. It’s not a “test,” but it is a screening process.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSend Us Your Questions About the Workplace!\\n\\nThe columnists behind our new advice column, Good Job, want to help you navigate your social dynamics at work. Does your colleague constantly bug you after hours? Has an ill-advised work romance gone awry? Ask us your question here!\\n\\nDear Prudence,\\n\\nMy husband and I are in our early 70s and have been pretty happily married for 40-plus years. We raised two lively, empathic, and bright children now in their late 30s. Our sweet and generous but emotionally reserved son is married to a lovely woman and their 4- year-old son is our adorable and adored grandson. We are normal-neurotic people, both with a good sense of humor and a spirit of community volunteer commitments and progressive political activism. My husband has depressive tendencies for which he has learned to take responsibility and I can be overly expressive, but I too am learning how to keep my counsel. We use therapy, exercise, reading, movies, and meditation to keep growing psychologically, spiritually, and intellectually and we have wonderful and devoted friends.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOur daughter, a climate justice activist herself, often said, even through young adulthood, that she and I should lead mother-daughter good communication workshops. Yet this same daughter, a vivacious, loving, and talented woman, enforced a no-contact order with us beginning almost two years ago, over her perception that we are not empathic enough about her health challenges, which have been many and various over the past 12 years. We have supported many of her alternative therapies during that time, and have been generous financially on our own limited budget, but we have also leaked to her our suspicion that she might have some anxiety that could require medication, which has angered her. She is in therapy, as far as we know, and we even joined her when she invited us into a session with her six months ago, but it went nowhere. She has a good and responsible job and has raised and saved enough money to have an expensive private surgery to fully free her windpipe from a constraining jaw to support better sleep. (A local hospital’s reputable overnight sleep apnea test reported to her that she did not show signs of sleep apnea, and we never knew that she had trouble sleeping in all the years she lived with us until college.)\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWe learned about her plans for this surgery through her brother, who is very annoyed with her and finds her estrangement wrong, but who doesn’t want to triangulate our relationships, and we agree with him. He is trying to keep her connected to family, and especially to our grandson, with whom she is wonderful. Our son is even contributing money for her surgery, about the necessity of which he has doubts, but he wants to signal loyalty. My husband and I have been heartbroken about this estrangement. I am wondering if the current apparent supportive communities for estrangement that include kids who have not been sexually, physically, or emotionally abused (or children of especially painful divorces where they had to take sides) are simply “victims” of well-intentioned necessarily flawed normal-neurotic parenting, in which everybody has to work hard to hang in and communicate, as in all loving relationships. If this is the case, then is it possible that this apparent uptick in estrangement of children from good-enough parents is another product of disaster capitalism? I am heartbroken, and wondering if the ugly politics of the moment aren’t dividing children from well-intentioned parents in addition to the obvious more clearly political divides getting all of the attention and interpretation.\\n\\n—Heartbroken and Wondering\\n\\nDear Heartbroken and Wondering,\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI have a few reactions to your letter, and they all revolve around one sentiment, which is: You don’t know the full story. And I think that’s what you need to work on accepting for yourself.\\n\\nOf course, given our current culture of pop therapy-speak, there is going to be some level of misappropriation, misuse, or misunderstanding of certain pathologies and traumas. But I’m not sure that your own experience with your daughter necessarily means that the overall upward trend in family estrangement is necessarily bunk or misguided. In my limited experience writing this advice column for the last two months, I can tell you that simply reading the daily submissions has shifted my perspective on how just many people seem to encounter abuse and neglect within their family unit, even as fully grown adults. It’s possible that estrangement has become more common due to the general increased social isolation we’re experiencing as a society, but it’s just as possible that many people are now finding the tools and vocabulary they need to separate themselves from harmful parents and siblings. I certainly don’t know everyone’s full story here, and neither do you.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI can sympathize with how heartbroken you feel. It’s possible to have done everything correctly as a parent, but to still wind up in a messy (or severed) relationship with your children once they start growing up and making their own decisions. I certainly can’t provide any kind of medical opinion concerning your daughter’s surgery or the necessity of it, but if she’s resorting to such a serious measure, it’s clear that something is going on with her, and that she doesn’t feel well. You can understand then why it might be so hurtful and invalidating to feel like her parents don’t believe her (even if you were expressing these doubts with the best intentions). I don’t think you know the full story about what’s going on with your daughter. Of course it doesn’t make sense to you right now, because she’s only expressed a small fraction of what’s likely happening under the surface.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTake heart in the fact that estrangements can be temporary. You may need to give your daughter some space for now—it’s a good thing that your son is a small bridge to her life nonetheless, so at least you know the basic facts of her life. Once you are feeling ready to put your preconceptions and judgments aside and simply be supportive of your daughter, whatever the state of her well-being or the rationality of her decision-making, I think you could express these thoughts in an email or a letter to her. But other than that, there’s not much you can do but let the passage of time untangle some of the anguish that everyone here feels. It’s not necessarily a permanent state, but you do have to give up some control, and let your daughter find her own way.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDear Prudence,\\n\\nI feel so middle school with this, but I just found out in a weird way that my friends are hanging out without me. For reference, we’re all in college but living at home and dealing with strict parents. “Andrew,” “Jan,” “Melissa,” and I have been very close friends for a long time. Andrew and Jan have been dating for a couple of years and have tended to be wrapped up in their own world of being a couple.\\n\\nMelissa and her boyfriend (who I’m also on friendly terms with), Jan, and Andrew are all having a party and sleepover at Andrew’s to celebrate his birthday. I was not invited, but worse, I found out when Jan texted me asking if she could tell her mom I would be there (her strict mom likes me and would approve if she knew I was at the party). So I got a text basically saying that all my best friends are hanging out, and asking if they can pretend I’m there so that Jan could go.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI said yes because I don’t think her mom should be restricting her adult daughter’s activities like that, but I feel really insulted. I’m not great at reading social cues and my friends usually help me, but when it’s their cues, I don’t know what to think! My only guess is that it’s meant to be a double date type event, but seeing as how I’ve been individually friends with all of them since long before they dated, I feel left out. I don’t know if I should ask Jan why I wasn’t invited, take a hint and just not bother them, or how I should read the situation at all!\\n\\n—21-Year-Old Middle Schooler\\n\\nDear Middle Schooler,\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSince these are your close friends, first give them the benefit of the doubt. Let’s assume they thought you’d be uncomfortable about fifth-wheeling a double date, or that for some reason, you wouldn’t want to be there. So, the next time you’re in a group, I would calmly bring up the issue of the birthday, and say something like, “Hey, just so you guys know, I would really love to be invited to these kinds of things next time, especially if you’re celebrating an important occasion. It kind of bummed me out to cover for you without actually being part of the party.”\\n\\nDon’t be accusatory, don’t be angry—just express genuine disappointment and make it diamond crystal clear that you wish to be included in all future activities of this ilk. If they’re good friends, they shouldn’t let it happen again. But if this becomes a regular occurrence, where your theoretical presence is more valuable than your real one, then I would seriously reevaluate whether it’s worth maintaining relationships with these people.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDear Prudence,\\n\\nI’ve been living next to this couple, “Alexander” and “Cathy,” for a while now, and things have gotten… strange. Almost every night, the walls shake with Alexander’s cries. It’s not a sniffle or a soft sob. It’s a full, guttural wail that you can feel in your chest. I hear him begging her. The words blur together, but you can make out enough to know: He’s pleading for her to stay. It goes on for hours sometimes, until finally, he’s quiet. Cathy is silent mostly, but I can hear the weight of her sighs through the wall. There’s the occasional murmur—like she’s trying to reason with him, but it’s always the same. He doesn’t change. The next night, it starts all over again, like the whole thing is on a loop.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI can hear how he says, “I’ll change. I’ll quit drinking. I’ll quit smoking. I’ll do anything.” And every night, I hear her response in that quiet, exhausted voice, the one that doesn’t believe him anymore but can’t leave either. I don’t know what’s holding her there, but I hear it every night, and I can’t help but wonder what will happen if/when she does leave. There’s something so final about his sobs, like he might really break if she goes. I don’t know if he’s threatened self-harm, but it seems probable. I know it’s none of my business, but honestly, I’m worried about both of them. I have this feeling in the pit of my stomach that something terrible is going to happen. What should I do? What can I do? Should I say something?\\n\\n—The Neighbor\\n\\nDear Neighbor,\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhatever is happening on the other side of that wall absolutely sounds grim, but unless you’ve heard audible threats of self-harm (or violence), I’m not sure there is much you can do. Your letter contains a lot of hypotheticals that you’re layering onto this situation, but the truth is that you don’t actually know what’s going on with this couple and their relationship. If you don’t have an existing relationship with them as a neighbor, perhaps you can make an effort in the hallway or mailroom to at least introduce yourself and be a friendly face—and maybe try to suss out the vibes that way. If it’s simply just an issue of the noise, I would raise my concerns to the landlord or super directly. But until you have real evidence for concern, you have to remind yourself that it really isn’t your business and respect the privacy of your neighbors.\\n\\n—Delia\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nClassic Prudie\\n\\nMy sister is expecting triplets so I have been stockpiling as many diapers as I can when I find them discounted. My local grocery store marks them down several times a month but it is done randomly. Employees are not allowed to buy them or hold discounted items while they are on the clock. There is a serious threat of termination. An employee told me this. She was pregnant and wished she would buy a lot like I did. I offered to buy and hold them for her. I work right across the street and she could just pay me back wholesale.\"},\n",

Submit questions here.\\n\\nDear Prudence,\\n\\nMy mother keeps giving me underhanded gifts. It’s happened for years. As an example, I have a badly scarred spine from scoliosis surgery, and she bought me a backless dress. I’m allergic to nuts, but she buys me peanut butter truffles. I’m recovering from body-image issues (which she caused by calling me fat throughout my childhood), and she sends me high-calorie foods. I’m 18 now, but she still sends me these underhanded gifts every single holiday. I’ve tried talking about it but she just plays the victim (i.e., “You don’t like what I bought you? Why do you hate your mother! I’m just trying my best!”) and I don’t know how to say, “Just stop giving me these insults covered in wrapping paper!” without hurting her feelings, because then she’ll cry to my dad, her parents, and my sisters that I hate her, and then I’m fighting with the entire family. How can I make her stop?\\n\\n—Tired in Texas\\n\\nDear Texas,\\n\\nWhile it’s difficult to deny the urge to play armchair psychologist and wonder at your mother’s passive-aggressiveness (not to mention her inability to take feedback without making it about her), I think it’s a better use of everyone’s time if you simply establish a blanket “No gifts” rule from the entire family for a while. Say that you’re trying to be less materialistic, and that you’d like to redirect any gifting efforts to your favorite charity. If the rule applies to the entire family, your mother can’t make it about her. Hopefully this way, you can finally enjoy trips to the mail room without dreading what barbed insult might be waiting for you.\\n\\nIf your mother continues to foist these loaded gifts onto you via mail, I give you permission to hand over the packages to a willing friend without even opening them—or ask the post office to return the package to sender. The second option may open up the conversation you’re trying to avoid, but you might be better off talking about the issue than skirting around it forever.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGet advice from Prudie—submit a question!

Dear Prudence, * Your letter signoff Your pronouns Your email (optional and confidential—please include if you're open to Dear Prudence following up) Submit\\n\\nDear Prudence,\\n\\nMy 25-year-old kid, “Alex,” lives with me. Alex is a talented visual artist and my ex-husband and I have all supported their endeavors in that regard, including some significant financial sacrifices. Alex seems to be suffering from the classic case of failure to launch, but that isn’t really why I’m writing. My issue is with Alex is lack of ability to care for their health. I believe they have an unaddressed eating disorder. Alex was a skinny child, and in their last two years of high school, carried around just a few extra pounds, but was active and had good eating habits. Alex was in their second year of college when COVID hit. Around that time, Alex started on antidepressants, and fell and cracked their pelvis. They were suddenly stuck alone in a three-story walk up having food and groceries delivered. They put on 100 pounds in three months. I don’t talk to Alex about the weight. I believe Alex lies to their doctor about their eating habits and hasn’t been honest about their overeating.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nNow that Alex has moved back in with me, as a mother, I’m finding it becoming impossible to watch them eat less than one vegetable a day, and make many, many other poor food choices that their long-term health is going to pay for in major ways. It isn’t even really the weight I’m worried about, at least not so much as the fact that Alexis barreling toward major health issues, including adult diabetes, for which there is much precedent on both sides of the family. The final straw for me came yesterday when I told them I was getting a non-prescription blood sugar monitor for myself and offered to get one for them. They shut me down hard and fast so I know I touched a nerve. I want to kick them out of the house for my own sanity. It is too hard for me to watch. I do see signs of maturity kicking in ever since they got their first job six months ago, so maybe it’s time. Am I wrong to kick them out? How do I do that?\\n\\n—Body Conscious\\n\\nDear Body Conscious,\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nPart of becoming an adult involves learning how to tend to your health, but I can’t imagine that the pandemic (or Alex’s other mental and physical health concerns) made that easy. I would encourage you to have a little more compassion regarding this extraordinarily hellish and isolating period for your child during a stage of their life that would already be confusing and overwhelming under normal circumstances. It sounds like they did the best they could.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAnd in my experience, it’s not uncommon for people to spend their entire 20s (and 30s!) figuring out how to establish and maintain a healthy lifestyle. That’s all to say that while I don’t think Alex’s lifestyle habits are necessarily ideal, they’re certainly not out of the ordinary for someone of their age or generation. It sounds like Alex has specific feelings about their health and their weight, so they’re not totally oblivious to your concerns. But this is a journey they have to navigate on their own; at that age, no one wants to listen to what their parents think they should do with their bodies.\\n\\nOf course, as Alex’s mother, you can’t help but worry. I think you can use that as the real reason for motivating Alex to move out. First, apologize for offering the unsolicited blood sugar monitor. Explain to Alex that, as their mother, it’s been your job for the past 25 years to be fussy and “annoying” about their well-being. Now that they’re a grown adult, you can understand theoretically that it’s no longer your job to nag them about things like vegetables or food choices (which is true), but that it will still be difficult to curb the motherly impulse, especially when Alex is still living under your roof. You can say something like, “Listen, I don’t have to agree with the choices you’re making, but when we’re living in such close proximity, I can’t help worrying or judging those choices.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIdeally, Alex should get the hint here, which is: If they continue to stay in your house, you’re going to continue to nag. And that’s not going to be fun for either of you, or your relationship. Talk about how some much-needed space will be better for everyone, especially since it’ll get you off their back.\\n\\nSend Us Your Questions About the Workplace!\\n\\nThe columnists behind our new advice column, Good Job, want to help you navigate your social dynamics at work. Does your colleague constantly bug you after hours? Has an ill-advised work romance gone awry? Ask us your question here!\\n\\nDear Prudence,\\n\\nI have a friend who identifies as a vegetarian. I’ve never seen him eat meat and have no reason to doubt his commitment to a plant-based lifestyle. But on several recent occasions, he enthusiastically ordered and ate a Caesar salad. Now, I’m a vegetarian too—and so I happen to know that Caesar dressing almost always contains anchovies. (There are vegan alternatives, but they weren’t listed on the menu.) On occasions when I’ve seen him eating it, though, I have refrained from telling my friend that he was likely eating fish products.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMy question: Should I have told him? And should I tell him now, so he knows in the future? If so, how do I bring it up? It feels a little rude to say, “Hey, you actually can’t eat that thing you obviously enjoy.” Although I’m a vegetarian, I, of course, believe people should be able to decide for themselves what to eat. What if he already knows that Caesar dressing contains anchovies and has simply decided his vegetarian principles are flexible enough to allow it? I don’t want to come across as shaming him for being an insufficiently committed vegetarian!\\n\\n—Fishy Situation\\n\\nDear Fishy Situation,\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAs long as you broach the subject from a place of non-judgment and genuine concern, it’ll be hard for you to go wrong here. Next time he reaches for that dish, all you have to say is: “Hey, since I know you’re vegetarian, I just wanted to double-check that you know the deal about Caesar salad.” But you could also make a comment next time along the lines of, “Wow, I used to really love an anchovy-heavy Caesar salad. How is it here?”\\n\\nDear Prudence,\\n\\nMy girlfriend calls herself an introvert, but I think it’s more accurate to say she’s an extrovert who hates the company of pretty much everyone but me. Because of this, all of her extroverted energy is directed toward me. I’m extremely introverted and need alone time to decompress, which she doesn’t understand and takes as a personal rejection. We moved in together this past summer, and we’re both teachers in the same school district, so there are no times when she’s at work and I’m at home. So there are no breaks from the togetherness and interaction. Shopping trips, yard work, and meetups with friends are all couples activities.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI’ve tried to gently suggest that my need for a few hours to read, listen to music, or whatever in an empty house is not a rejection of her, but it’s just not getting through. I’ve tried to push her to go out with friends alone, but she claims to dislike them and their vibes. She’s a wonderful person in every other way and I genuinely love her, and it seems weird to consider breaking up over this, but the thought of 50 or more years of this makes my anxiety spiral out of control. Is there a solution I’m missing?\\n\\n—Please Leave Me Be\\n\\nDear Please,\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIntroverts or not, that’s a lot of togetherness for a couple. I would suggest that you raise this issue with her as a matter of relationship styles and possible codependency. Have a talk where you both share your views on what an ideal week might look like in terms of time shared as a couple versus time spent doing your own thing. She will likely not see the problem with doing everything together all the time, which is where you can discuss your concerns about growing too codependent (every couple, of course, is a little codependent. It’s kind of the point!).\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAsk open, curious questions about what your girlfriend needs to feel safe and secure in the relationship, and then see if you can bring the conversation to a place where you both can negotiate over how best to address each others’ needs. If you can agree to schedule a bonding activity for the two of you after a block of alone time, would that make her feel more secure?\\n\\nUltimately, you may find out that your girlfriend wants to be that codependent, and that may be a difference in relationship preferences that will have long-term implications. But first, find out from her perspective why it feels so important to have so much togetherness in the first place.\\n\\n—Delia\\n\\nClassic Prudie\\n\\nMy older brother lost his wife suddenly when he was 28. She was literally the girl next door and they’d been together since they were 14. It was devastating and I don’t think he has ever really gotten over her loss despite grief counseling and time. He briefly tried dating about five years after she’d passed but said it felt empty and hollow and he didn’t enjoy it. Fast forward 14 years and he is a successful businessman with a lot of hobbies. His life is pretty full but he gets lonely sometimes and wants human connection, but not a commitment. With the popularity of hook up apps, he is able to have his sexual needs met and when he wants to go out to dinner or have companionship on a date, he hires an escort.\"},\n",

       "   'content': 'How to Do It is Slate’s sex advice column. Have a question? Send it to Stoya and Rich here. It’s anonymous!\\n\\nDear How to Do It,\\n\\nI am a 52-year-old heterosexual man. I was a computer nerd as a teenager and into my 20s, and I very likely I have some form of Asperger’s syndrome. I was always awkward with girls. I had steady relationships, but eventually around age 21, I stopped dating women entirely because it seemed all they brought to me was pain and confusion—until I met my wife around age 25, whom I’ve been with ever since.\\n\\nAround age 40, a mentor of mine explained what I needed to do to be successful in corporate America: Coach my kids’ Little League team so that everyone knows I’m a good father; mentor underprivileged kids so that everyone knows I’m a good man; never shy away from explaining my anti-racist and anti-sexist politics so that everyone knows I can be trusted; mentor people who aren’t like me, like women and minorities; go to the hottest barbershop in our city and pay for a perfect politician’s haircut every month; buy Armani and Brooks Brothers suits and handmade leather shoes; buy a Tesla so that people know I’m rich and care about the environment. It’s not my personality to show off, but following this checklist has really helped my self-esteem and helped me with clients, and I’ve become a new man. Right now, I look like a chubbier, “woke Mitt Romney”—not my term. However, in my heart, I don’t always understand people and their motivations, and I’m still a very shy computer nerd.\\n\\nThree years ago, my hair turned a certain shade of silver, and from that point forward, about 1 in every 20 women I work with, especially those in their early 20s, started making passes at me. Our group of eight college interns decided to have lunch with me on Thursdays, which I agreed to for mentorship purposes, but they seemed to be in competition to get my attention, doing stuff like lifting up a shirt to show me tattoos, texting me vacation pictures in bathing suits or bikinis, or trying to give me a back rub (I do not want to be touched in the office). In one lunch with four of them, they told me I was a “low-key Daddy” and went through this list of what was attractive about me to a 22-year-old—I had never heard this term before then. That’s where one called me “woke Mitt Romney.” It’s really flattering, so I didn’t realize that I needed to set boundaries, and then things got kind of weird when I set them later. Now, in recent Zoom meetings during COVID times, there are women who treat Zoom like a private session and multiple clients or interns either accidentally or on purpose calling me “Daddy.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn one case when I was mentoring a college freshman who was one of our most junior interns, she went into a speech about how good I was to her, how she’d had bad experiences with men her whole life, how my kindness and nurturing allowed her to trust men again and improve her grades, and how special I was to her. The weekend after she left our internship program, she sexted me underwear pictures and photos every day to the point I put my foot down, told her to see a therapist, and blocked her number. Another time a co-worker whom I was enjoying witty repartee with in our office called me her “future husband.” I was too freaked out to report her and just tried to pretend I imagined it. About four weeks ago a woman from our company reached out to me, but I wasn’t interested in responding to her, and she accused me of avoiding her to talk to other women co-workers. I had to report her to HR.\\n\\nYou can see that some of this is incredible for my ego. But I don’t think I understand what’s happening. Other men seem to be in complete control of who is interested in them, but to me, I feel like a pinball. All these incidents were turn-ons, honestly, but I don’t want to lose my marriage or my career by fooling around with an intern. I’m a man, I like the attention a lot, and late at night, I get really turned on reliving these conversations. But at 52 I can’t have an affair with an intern 30-plus years younger than me. At the same time, I feel this deep, crushing regret that no women were interested in me when I was 22 but at 52, as a married father and corporate executive, I could probably have seduced about two dozen women in the past three years. I feel torn because I want to have sex with young, hot women and I seem to be able to do this now. However, I also don’t want to end my marriage and my family. I might be able to get an open marriage, but even then, I can’t sleep with a 24-year-old woman from work who already has boundary issues! I also know, deep inside, that I’m 52, and by 57 or 60, I won’t be a “daddy” anymore—I’ll be an Old Man, so this attention won’t happen for much longer.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nJust to confirm, the majority of women I work with are not interested in me at all. I am perfectly capable of telling the difference. I do not think waitresses or the girls at Starbucks angling for tips are interested in me either. What do you think is going on here and what do you think I should do? I feel like we’re going to come back from COVID-19 and those girls who called me “Daddy” on Zoom are going to say it to my face, and this whole process is going to start all over again. I feel like I have to just make a decision before we go back, to either openly communicate boundaries or to ask for an open marriage (and if my wife says yes—and I think it’s a possibility—then give this a try). What do you think?\\n\\n—Distressed Dad\\n\\nDear Distressed Dad,\\n\\nI think what’s happening is that you’ve found yourself riding the crest of a cultural wave of breathless daddy/zaddy appreciation. The democratizing effect of the internet has allowed people to be louder about their interests than ever, and that noise helps shape cultural mores. At the same time, the distinguished older gentleman has long been prized in a culture of male privilege that rarely offers the same admiration for mature women. Sean Connery was 59 when People magazine declared him the Sexiest Man Alive in 1989. Burt Reynolds wasn’t yet 40 when he splayed out on a bearskin for his iconic Cosmopolitan centerfold of 1972, but he sure did look it (and then some) by today’s standards. At 50, Shemar Moore has never been more doable. And don’t even get me started on Delroy Lindo’s vulnerable intensity in Da 5 Bloods. Has 67 ever looked riper?\\n\\nMen: still doing great.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI’m going to guess that you always had some kind of sexy, swaggy thing to you—after all, you attracted a wife whom you’ve managed to hold on to for nearly 30 years. You state that you don’t always understand people and their motivations, so it’s likely that in times that were less welcoming to the open expression of women’s sexual interests, you may have missed some covert drooling and eyes that were silently undressing you.\\n\\nIt seems like you have decent perspective already—hold onto that and do not start banging your subordinates. I would be a hypocrite to dissuade you from pursuing an open relationship given everything I’ve been preaching on the subject of nonmonogamy in this space for a good year and a half, but tread lightly if your wife gives you the green light. Seeing people up close often makes people even more confusing, especially when the casual intimacy you share with them suddenly and without explanation ceases. And even the most open-minded wife probably doesn’t envision you prowling around every night like an alley cat whose sense of smell just won’t quit. I think the boundaries of the arrangement with your wife should be set very clearly, and you should practice as much self-control as possible. Don’t overdo it. Nibble, don’t feast.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDear How to Do It,\\n\\nI have HPV (like most of the population), and while technically it’s Type 1, my first and last breakout was vaginal. I got it from my current partner, but sometimes I read about people disclosing HPV to their sex partners. It makes me wonder, if I ever were to reenter the dating world, would I really have to disclose that one time in my life I had an outbreak? It’s been more than 10 years, and my one and only outbreak was only brought on by the trauma of birth. It feels really unlikely that I’ll get it again or that I’ll pass it on. But I don’t know the actual risk, and I definitely want to be ethical in any future relationships.\\n\\n—HPV Q\\n\\nDear HPV Q,\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI’m going to invoke the sage words of my HTDI partner Stoya from an earlier column in which we discussed this topic: “If you have an active infection, you need to disclose. That’s my unilateral judgment.” I think this mindset represents the ideal, and it’s my responsibility to impart it, but I understand that life is not ideal and your points are valid. Something that might make your life easier when you cross this hypothetical bridge is getting rescreened to see if your body has cleared the virus—most HPV infections go away on their own. Failing that, disclosure with the caveats that you’ve touched on here and additionally noting the prevalence of HPV (which makes its stigmatization that much more absurd) could help foster understanding. In all likelihood, either your partner has it, has had it, or will get it, and the same goes for their past partners. That is a fact that bears reminding, and it means that if people are so afraid of HPV, they simply shouldn’t be hooking up. It’s just that common. And the vaccine helps! It can protect you from strains you haven’t contracted, for one thing. Worth looking into.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDear How to Do It,\\n\\nMy husband and I have been together for 16 years and had a baby shortly before COVID-19 took over America. Probably halfway into our relationship, his kinks started to show. Nothing major, but he has cuckolding and humiliation fantasies, and often wants me to be a little dominant. (We are both pretty submissive, though.)\\n\\nHis biggest fantasies, however, seem to be about pushing me to be more sexually adventurous. I’m fairly vanilla, and though we’ve both gotten off to some risqué stuff, I’m not naturally into pushing my boundaries much. He really likes it when I talk dirty to him, and I used to do this while describing elaborate cuckolding fantasies to him. (If I’m talking about my fantasies, it’s usually rape scenarios of various levels of debauchery.) But over the years, he has been able to tell when I’m “pretending” and “telling stories” rather than saying what I feel is hot.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSo these days, it doesn’t really matter what I say as long as it’s authentic. During the pandemic, we’ve fled to stay with family in a very small house to get help with child care while we work remotely, and we are only able to get away for a couple of hours a week to have sex in a car like teenagers. It’s really hard for me to be authentically sexy in those brief interludes; I feel like I’m in an improv class and need to come up with something interesting to say or do. My husband says I just need to be in the moment. The result is that I just clam up. I get scared and uncomfortable and embarrassed, and it can take minutes before I say anything at all, and I usually start with “Umm … hmm. I don’t know what to say” before I get into it.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWe’ve now had several instances where he hasn’t gotten off at all and is hurt and angry at me for not making more of an attempt to please him. He says that he spends a lot of time and energy trying to think of new ways to turn me on and explore my fantasies, and I don’t do this for him. It’s true! He does! And I don’t! I rarely think about sex unless we’re having it. I am just not that sexual that much of the time, and I have been this way since long before we had a baby. We had these types of issues with sex before COVID; it’s just that there is now this added time pressure (and the general sense of doom and gloom in the world) coloring our few romantic moments together a week.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI do get turned on and I am attracted to him, and I’m often fine with quiet, tender sex (with the help of my vibrator). I worry sometimes that we’re sexually incompatible. So this is my attempt to broaden my horizons. How can I be less inhibited and authentic in my sexuality? Do you have tricks for thinking up what to say in these kinds of scenarios? Am I actually prudish or has America tricked me into being vanilla? In therapy, I’ve discovered that one of my biggest problems is not knowing what I want in all aspects of my life. And that’s one thing when it comes to my own mental health, but now it’s infringing on my partner’s.\\n\\n—Hmm\\n\\nDear Hmm,\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI think you like what you like, your sex drive seems to be lower than your husband’s through no fault of your own, and he is not entitled to your creative energy. His notion of sexual generosity is corrupt. Generosity is not “I do this for you so that you do the same for me.” Generosity is: “I do this for you. Period!” Nowhere in the golden rule is there a stipulation about what the do-gooder is entitled in return. It’s open-ended by design, with good reason: If you expect people to adhere to your high standards, you’re bound to be disappointed at some point. Plus, it’s probably easier for him to spend energy and time thinking of ways to turn you on because he’s just more interested in sex than you are.\\n\\nIncompatibility could be an issue here. If you were less participatory, I’d encourage you to try—sometimes a little bit of rolling around can get you in the mood when you previously thought you weren’t capable of such a state—but it seems like you’re doing your part. You aren’t infringing on your partner; you’re just being you. If you have sexual interests you want to cultivate, by all means bring them to your bedroom, but I don’t really think that you’re going to induce, like, a piss fetish from nothing. Unlike piss itself, you can’t just bear down and make a fetish for it happen. I don’t know if you’ve been indoctrinated into vanilla proclivities by culture—you’re probably the only person with the longitudinal data to begin to make such a call about yourself—but it doesn’t sound like it to me, given your exposure to kink and relative disinterest. And I’m sorry, I have absolutely no smut hacks. I’ve always found it burdensome when a partner expects me to amp up the dirty talk beyond the spare but intense sprinklings that I naturally provide, so I’m not going to brainstorm for yours. I think you need to tell your husband you are being authentic in your sexuality and it’s time figure out boundaries that work better for both of you.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDear How to Do It,\\n\\nFor some reason, I have always had this feeling that there is something “dirty” about my semen. This makes me uncomfortable with getting it on the bedsheets, the carpet, or the furniture when I masturbate. For years, I have put a towel underneath me to try to catch it when I orgasm, but this doesn’t always work. I get very anxious about it when it happens. In fact, as soon as I realize it’s happening, I worry so much about it that I can’t really enjoy my orgasm. I even feel some shame about it, as if I’ve somehow contaminated the carpet, the sheets, or the furniture. Is this a feeling shared by others? How do I stop having these dirty and shameful feelings so that I can fully enjoy my orgasms?\\n\\n—Spunk Funk\\n\\nDear Spunk Funk,\\n\\nI’ve devised a way to test whether I can help you from a distance. See if reading this changes your mind: Your semen is not dirty. There is literally no dirt in it.\\n\\nIf that recitation of the rational truth does not do the trick, I’m afraid your condition is bigger than what I can treat. You should see a therapist and also start ejaculating into a sock. Just put a sock over your dick as soon as you start coming and you’ll catch it it all. For big loads, invest in tube socks.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThere are many things that could be going on with you psychologically (contamination worries are common in people with OCD, for example), but it could be as simple as shame. I think shame causes a lot of people to have negative thoughts about their own bodily functions, which may include a fear that their semen is somehow disgusting. However, considering it dirty, per se, isn’t what I would call common. I also think that experience has a good way of assuaging these concerns. If enough people eat your cum and don’t immediately start retching, you get the idea that you’re fine. At least, I did. If you’re not quite at the point of offering a DNA tasting menu to prospective gourmands, perhaps a bit of solo exposure therapy would help. If you try your semen for yourself, you may find that it’s not so bad at all. I mean, it’s not vichyssoise or anything, but semen is generally bland and inoffensive to the tongue. (I strongly believe that the widely reported distaste for it has more to do with psychological reasons than gustatory ones, and I also believe that’s case for the people who just looooooove it.) Good luck out there.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n—Rich\\n\\nMore How to Do It\\n\\nI’m a procrastinator; my partner is a do-it-yesterday-er. Earlier this year, I was kvetching about doing my taxes. My partner, by way of motivation, said “Get ‘em done and I’ll blow you.” Because my partner is very Good at That, I got to work immediately, but was held up by some missing paperwork. Flash forward to now, and the missing form is in hand. Pleased with myself for filing, I mentioned to my partner that I’d be taking that BJ at their next earliest convenience. They scoffed and told me I can’t expect an IRS EZBJ two-plus months after the fact. I call breach of contract! We’ve agreed to abide by your ruling, so what say you?'},\n",

       "   'content': \"How to Do It is Slate’s sex advice column. Have a question? Send it to Jessica and Rich here. It’s anonymous!\\n\\nDear How to Do It,\\n\\nThe area where my husband and I live is a magnet for winter sports enthusiasts. Recently, we invited a couple who we are friends with to stay at our place, as hotel prices are outrageous this time of year and we live close to excellent skiing. They were perfect house guests except for one thing: Every night they engaged in loud, practically marathon-length love-making. To say the woman is a screamer would be the understatement of the decade. Needless to say, we didn’t get much sleep. What’s a tactful way of handling something like this for the future?\\n\\n—Couldn’t Catch Any Z’s in Colorado\\n\\nDear Couldn’t Catch Any Z’s in Colorado,\\n\\nThe sad fact of life is that you aren’t entitled to consideration, no matter how pronounced yours is. If you graciously invite someone into your house, they may insult your mother, kick your dog, scare your child, take a shit on your floor, and/or have a screaming orgasm while separated from you by a mere wall. There is little you can do to prevent this. This is the downside of generosity: You open your heart/home and someone might shit on/in it. I would argue that pure generosity, in fact, leaves itself open to be exploited.\\n\\nIn the future, I think the best you can do preemptively is to tell your guests that your walls are thin, you and your husband are light sleepers, and everyone should try to stay as quiet as possible at night. This may stretch the truth (I don’t know if your walls are actually thin), but it’s not an egregious invention and at least you’d be reminding people up front to mind their manners. Again, whether they will or not is kind of a crap shoot. Should they nonetheless have pyrotechnical sex the first night, you would have every right to remind them the next day that you can hear everything in this house. Maybe that’s not “tactful” but it would be completely justified on your part.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIt’s strange what we find rude as a culture sometimes. Ellen DeGeneres used to tell a joke (she in fact may still tell this joke, I don’t know the woman) about how when someone inadvertently spits on you while talking, wiping off the mess is considered ruder than the spit, which is just bonkers. (I can’t believe I’m referencing Ellen in this column, but here we are.) You can gently push back on the weird social contract that states that the only thing ruder than rudeness is pointing out rudeness because it’s a nonsense contract and getting rid of it would be better for humanity than feeling stifled by minor slights and transgressions.\\n\\nIf no straightforward acknowledgment of the noise or your guests’ potential for making it is satisfactory to you, arm yourself for a good night’s sleep. Ear plugs/noise-canceling headphones, a white noise machine, and placing your guests as far as possible from your room could all be useful. There’s a fine line to walk between being a chill host and allowing the carnal desires of your guests to temporarily take over your life—erring on the side of modifying your behavior and situation might be the least awkward way to handle it. I would expect nothing less from a host as gracious as yourself.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGet advice—submit a question!

I’m out of the shower for an hour. Musty. Idly watching TV. Musty. Using a urinal. Musty. Should I shave down there? (I don’t.) Is there deodorant for one’s nether regions? Should I wear shorts more often? This has been a sudden onset and I’m at a loss of where to begin.\\n\\n—Must Be Nice\\n\\nDear Must Be Nice,\\n\\nBeing a white gay man in Brooklyn, I have little expertise regarding deodorizing one’s parts. OK, that’s an exaggeration, but a slight one. Here, the funk is deep and diffuse. And you know what? A lot of guys like it. Elements of manhood are often prized to the point of fetishization by my immediate demographic, sure, but there are people of all stripes that enjoy body odor. I have to wonder how big your problem actually is. It’s true, not everyone’s chemistry is going to be mass-appealing and there are things that can cut through a beautiful, pure body odor (if someone sweats a lot and then it dries up naturally, the results can be sour), but let me tell you: A little musty, when it’s the right kind of musty, can be very nice.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThere is deodorant for balls, though. Sometimes, this is marketed straightforwardly (as in the case of Fresh BALLS) and sometimes it’s sold under the more euphemistic guise of “intimate deodorant for men” or even “whole body” deodorant. Men’s Health recently rounded up its favorite ball deodorants, so if you want to start trying them, you could start there. Powder is another potential odor mitigator that you might want to try, something like Gold Bond perhaps. Good breathable underwear might also be useful—I’m partial to Uniqlo’s Airism line. The ones I like are made of nylon and spandex. You may want to experiment with that and also others made of pure cotton to see which works better for you.\\n\\nSince your ball funk was sudden onset, another thing you might want to consider is that you could have jock itch, which often comes with a distinctive and, yes, musty smell. Intertrigo, a condition resulting from skin rubbing together, can sometimes lead to secondary infections, including candida, or yeast, which can also smell. Over-the-counter remedies for jock itch and fungal infections are available. If you suspect either of these conditions, though, consider visiting a doctor, who could diagnose you and direct you to the most effective treatment.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSend Us Your Questions About the Workplace\\n\\nFor a forthcoming advice column, we want to help you navigate your social dynamics at work.

Is there a correct way to give a blow job?\\n\\n—Sucks to Not Be Able to Suck\\n\\nDear Sucks to Not Be Able to Suck,\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThere is no one correct way to give a blow job, just as there isn’t a correct way to write one’s name. You do it how you do it. You should, though, modify your technique for the particular penis you’re working. If his dick is reliably making you gag, and no one’s enjoying that, consider taking less of it in your mouth. Maybe just an inch or two while you stroke the shaft below. Maybe you lick up and down the shaft and intermittently suck on the head. Your boyfriend’s feedback would be useful here, as well. How does he want to be sucked? If he prefers deep throating, you might not be fit for the task, though there have been some proposed methods for lessening/ridding yourself of a gag reflex, which we’ve explored in a previous column. Also consider your positioning. As my partner in HDTI, Jessica Stoya, wrote in a previous column, “In a blowjob where the person is standing, I can usually get about 3.25 inches into my mouth. When they’re laying on their back and I’m crouched over them, that number goes up to a little over 5 inches.” Sometimes coming at the dick from above, 69 style, can help make length more take-able, though this also depends on the dick shape.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAnother thing to keep in mind: If the real issue here is your boyfriend’s loss of erection, he could consider wearing a cock ring, which may help him maintain an erection even if stimulation wanes momentarily. An even stronger option would be taking a PDE5 inhibitor like tadalafil (generic Cialis) or sildenafil (generic Viagra). That could help keep him hard while you experiment on the best ways to suck him, giving you more leeway and wood for trial and error.\\n\\n—Rich\\n\\nMore Advice From Slate\\n\\nI had a whirlwind romance during the pandemic that involved some of the best sex of my life. The guy and I actually ended up living together for a few months, but I broke it off because it seemed almost two explosive. A few years later, he got sober, and is interested in dating again. I want to, but I’m actually a little suspicious of why he’s being so nice. Could it be too good to be true?\"},\n",

       "   'content': 'Care and Feeding is Slate’s parenting advice column. Have a question for Care and Feeding? Submit it here or post it in the Slate Parenting Facebook group.\\n\\nDear Care and Feeding,\\n\\nUp until two weeks ago, my husband “Jeff” (39) was a model family man and father to “Jenny” (8) and “Kyle” (6). About the only problem in our marriage was his insomnia, and while it was difficult to deal with him getting up 5-6 times a night, every night, it was hardly his fault.\\n\\nStill, after over a decade of trying to treat the insomnia with nothing working except for drugs that had side effects worse than the insomnia itself, we eventually decided on adding a bedroom annex to the home office, and Jeff sleeping there instead of with me. Ever since then, he’s been half-assing as a father. He spends most of his time in that office and auxiliary bedroom sulking. And he only periodically comes out to do his end of the housework. I almost don’t want him parenting our children, because when he does, he barely says anything and never smiles or laughs, which is very unlike his former personality.\\n\\nThe kids have picked up on it too. Jenny has asked me, in private, when I and Jeff are getting divorced. She did not seem to believe me when I told her we weren’t splitting up. I’m at my wit’s end here, and I can’t be a single mom in a two-parent household. How do I get him to be the man he was just a month ago?\\n\\n— Snapping Him Out Of It\\n\\nDear Snapping Him Out Of It,\\n\\nSo if I understand the situation correctly: Your husband Jeff is withdrawn and not himself, to the extent that even the kids are noticing. He’s isolating himself from his loved ones. And he’s had a sudden and extreme personality shift, and you no longer even feel comfortable having him parent your children. Girl, your man’s not shirking his responsibilities, he’s in trouble!!\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSeriously, these sound like the hallmarks of someone who is struggling, and I’d be very concerned if I were you. Did something happen two weeks ago, besides the bedroom change? I think you need to sit Jeff down and have a real conversation with him. “So you went into this new bedroom and now you’re withdrawn and distant and our daughter is worried we’re getting a divorce. What’s going on?” Hopefully from there you can get him what he needs to get back to the man he was a month ago.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI understand that you want your old husband back who was pleasant and helpful and was only struggling with insomnia, but to me, this guy sounds like he needs some real help. Please help get him to a professional ASAP.\\n\\nDear Care and Feeding,\\n\\nMy 4-½-year old son is very worried about death lately. Earlier this year we had to put our beloved 15-year-old cat to sleep after a short (but intense) illness, and I don’t think any of us were prepared for it. Throughout the summer he would occasionally say out of the blue, “I wish our cat didn’t die” and we would have some short conversations about death. (It’s forever, no he won’t come back, it’s okay to be sad, we’ll always have our happy memories, do you want to talk about them?)\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn the last few weeks, his comments have suddenly turned a corner: he says, “I don’t want you to die” and worries that he won’t see me ever again. And sometimes even that he doesn’t want to die! Every time I assure him it’s something that won’t happen for a long time, that I take good care of myself and of him so we’ll stay healthy and safe, and that he’ll always be loved and cared for. I’m feeling like a broken record—am I doing it right? Or is there something else to say? We’re not religious so we aren’t bringing talk of heaven into it.\\n\\n— At A Loss\\n\\nDear At A Loss,\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI remember this phase very clearly and it happened for my son at the exact same age. All of a sudden, he needed to know: Who is going to die; what makes people die; was I going to die; was he? Right before starting kindergarten, he told me he was scared “because you get higher and higher and then in a long time you die.” Thanks for that reminder, bud!\\n\\nThis is a developmentally appropriate time for your son to be beginning to understand the concept of death. Children at this age often ask the same question repeatedly because they struggle with the finality and irreversibility of death. You’re doing the right thing by keeping your explanations simple and clear, and by not using euphemisms, as they can be confusing or inadvertently frightening. It’s great, too, to remind him of the steps you take to stay alive as long as possible. Grief can be tricky. If you feel his questions over time are still tied to the loss of his pet, remind him that it’s totally fine to be sad and to cry for as long as he needs. You’re doing your job as a parent by teaching your son how to navigate the hard feelings that are an inevitable part of life.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nCatch Up on Care and Feeding\\n\\n• If you missed Monday’s column, read it here.\\n\\n• Discuss this column in the Slate Parenting Facebook group!\\n\\nDear Care and Feeding,\\n\\nHow do families with two working parents have children in school? We have two young kids with the older one set to start kindergarten in 2023. Currently, they’re both at an amazing daycare that we love; they’re stimulated, learning, and cared for, so we are able to simply focus on work during the week.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWith kindergarten looming, I’ve been checking the public school schedule, and they have 11 weeks off during the summer, five separate weeks off during the school year, nine holidays separate from those, and EVERY Wednesday is a half day. How do people manage such inconsistent childcare needs? The schools offer no solutions and seem to be on the archaic assumption that there is a stay-at-home parent in every household.\\n\\nWe’ve looked at the local private school, and they have much less time off and options for childcare when the school is closed, but I have two main hesitations with going private. One is that we currently pay more in daycare than we do for our mortgage, and we’ve been looking forward to that being in the past, and the other is that we live in a very diverse area, and I don’t want to be a part of the exodus from public education.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIs there a solution I’m overlooking? Do we just have to go with private school because we both work?\\n\\n— (Hopefully) Schooled In Seattle\\n\\nDear (Hopefully) Schooled In Seattle,\\n\\nSISTER OR BROTHER, YOU SAID IT. As a single mom, it is an endless source of frustration to me that school schedules seem to operate on the assumption that there is a stay-at-home parent readily available to pick children up mid-afternoon from school and provide childcare during the many yearly school holidays. Those of us who rely on afterschool programs or other childcare in the gap between school and the workday ending, also often end up scrambling to fit an hour of homework into the already tight dinner-bath-bedtime evening routine. (It’s enough to make a Kinsey scale 2 like me yearn for a 1950s housewife.)\\n\\nThis is a systemic issue. But in lieu of federal and state policy changes that better align work and school schedules, parents (and in my experience it’s often the moms who are managing these solutions) have to cobble together some kind of workable childcare at great financial expense. It sounds like you’ve already investigated the offerings in your district, but if you haven’t looked into it fully, many public schools partner with private organizations that offer aftercare in addition to daylong “kids’ day off” programs on professional days and holidays, which can be a big help. I have learned to rely on my local mom network for hot tips on good deals, nanny shares, or even to trade off watching our combined children on school holidays. But researching, implementing, and managing these solutions is a huge time suck and extremely stressful.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIf you have the means, a less expensive solution than private school would be to hire a babysitter to cover the time off. (It would also allow you to support your public school.) Because being able “to simply focus on work during the week” is truly a wonderful privilege that you might find is worth paying for.\\n\\nWant Advice From Care and Feeding?\\n\\nSubmit your questions about parenting and family life here. It’s anonymous! (Questions may be edited for publication.)\\n\\nDear Care and Feeding,\\n\\nI grew up in a culture where children basically have no input regarding who gets to hug, squeeze, or kiss them and who are regularly told, “Go give Random Old Man a kiss, he is grandma’s fourth cousin.” I am less than fond of the approach so have no problem telling people to go away and not touch my baby. My question is more about when and how we as the parents should also start applying that to ourselves.\\n\\nAs in, right now we shower her in kisses and cuddle with her endlessly (unless she starts fussing, at which point we will put her down or adjust the way we are making physical contact with her). But at some point, we should start asking for her permission or perhaps telling her that even mom and dad don’t get to kiss her if she doesn’t want them to.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI am not even going into the little heartbreak the thought of her not wanting a hug from me will inevitably cause, because I know it’s more important to teach her the confidence to turn down a hug. On the purely practical side of things, when is a baby old enough to understand this?\\n\\n— Can I Have a Hug Please?\\n\\nDear Can I Have a Hug Please?,\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI’m so happy to welcome my alter ego, Crazy Consent Mom, back to the table after her brief appearance last week. As a sexual assault survivor, consent education is one of my top parenting values, and in my opinion, you can start anytime by simply talking to babies and toddlers about what actions you are taking with them, as you pick them up or change their diaper.\\n\\nBy the time my son was verbal, he knew that 1) his body belongs to him; 2) he gets to choose who touches his body; and 3) If someone else tells us to stop touching their bodies, we do it immediately. These conversations should be regular and ongoing. We can model consent by asking questions like, “Do you want me to stop tickling you?”, “Do you want a hug right now?”, and “Can I sit close to you?” I try to ask my son if I can take a photograph of him, and respect his wishes if he says no, no matter how freaking adorable he looks. But the most important piece of all of this is that parents then have to respect their children’s stated boundaries.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThere are children’s books like “My Body! What I Say Goes!” and others that are intended to teach children about consent, and one of my all-time favorite children’s television moments is this song from “Doc McStuffins” that illustrates why you should always stop tickling someone when they say no, even if they seem to be enjoying it. Nuance!\\n\\nAnd it’s true that it’s not always easy! Our kids are cute af, and we love them! It’s tempting to insist on physical intimacy just because you want to squeeze them and kiss their precious little faces. Reader, I haven’t had a kiss from my son since at least 2019. And I want one. But what I want more is to raise a child who is well-versed in body autonomy, never violates the consent of others, and knows how to say “no” when it comes to his own body.\\n\\n—Emily'},\n",

       "   'content': \"Pay Dirt is Slate’s money advice column. Have a question? Send it to Kristin and Ilyce here. (It’s anonymous!)\\n\\nDear Pay Dirt,\\n\\nHow do adults pay for graduate school? My wife is starting a program in the fall, and we’re excited, but unsure of the best way to afford it.\\n\\nWe are both in our early thirties. My salary is around $90,000; my wife works part-time and brings in about $19,000/year, with a supplemental income source that can bring in up to $500 per week. When school starts, she’ll keep the part-time job and scale back on the supplemental work. The program is at a state school, so it’s not overly expensive, and she’ll be earning a degree that we know will lead to more lucrative jobs.\\n\\nWe recently became homeowners and have no debt, aside from a small credit card balance that we have nearly paid off. We are very low on liquid savings due to a period of unemployment after a furlough. Our next goal after paying off the credit card debt is to rebuild our savings.\\n\\nI know graduate schools do offer assistantships or other positions that include tuition remission, and that’s an avenue we’ll look into once it opens up. But that still leaves the first semester (probably the first year) of tuition for us to cover. We’ve filled out the FAFSA. I’ve considered a home equity line of credit (HELOC), and a personal loan. I’m terrified of student loans because I know the interest rates can be high. Family help is a possibility, but it’s not guaranteed. I’d love any ideas you have—what are our options here?\\n\\n—Future Social Worker WAG\\n\\nDear Future,\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIt sounds like you’re both on the right track, and I love that you’re already thinking about how to maintain your budget and stick with your financial goals once this new expense kicks in. It’s always a good idea to be financially prepared.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThat said, I would reconsider the student loan. One reason for this is the tax benefit. For now at least, student loan interest is tax deductible. In other words, you can deduct up to $2,500 of the interest you pay on student loans from your taxable income each year. This is true for both federal and private loans, but only if you meet certain income requirements. This all might change under our current leadership (which seems intent on making things more difficult for student borrowers and, well, just about everyone) but there are other reasons to reconsider, too. Student loan interest rates are typically lower than other types of loans (including HELOC), and that’s especially true for federal student loans. You’ve already filled out the FAFSA, the application for federal aid, so that’s your first step in figuring out what loan options are available in addition to grants and scholarships. What’s more, federally subsidized student loans also won’t start accruing interest until after your wife graduates. You can always pay it off sooner, but it’s a nice little buffer if you need it. Again, that may change in the near future, but it’s a big plus for your financial planning because it gives you more time until the interest kicks in.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nYou could also look into credit union loans, which typically offer much lower interest rates than traditional lenders. That’s because credit unions are nonprofit organizations designed to serve the community. Your mileage may vary, but there’s no harm in checking out their rates and doing a little comparison shopping.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nYou mentioned that your wife has a part-time job. Some employers offer tuition reimbursement for workers who continue their education. It’s worth checking if either of you can take advantage of this with your current jobs. If so, it could cover a portion of the tuition or fees.\\n\\nSince you’re already considering a HELOC or personal loan, it could be worth looking into a 0 percent APR credit card. There are always these kinds of credit card deals making the rounds —no interest on purchases for anywhere between 12 and 21 months. If you’re confident you can pay it off quickly, you could use the credit card to pay for tuition and other expenses, then save up and pay off the card before that promo period ends. Just be careful—if you don’t pay off the card in time, the interest rate will be sky high (in some cases, nearly 30 percent!), so this option can be a big debt trap. Beware of the fees and long-term costs.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFinally, if help from family is a possibility, I would have the conversation with them sooner rather than later. I get it— you probably don’t want to come across as asking for a handout, but if your family or your wife’s family is planning to offer some kind of financial assistance, it would be useful to know about it. Could you bring up the conversation to them casually? Simply mention that you’re trying to figure out what your financial life looks like for the next five years or so, tell them your plans, and see what they say. It might be a little awkward to talk about money, but if you want a clear vision of the future, the more information you have, the better.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGet advice—submit a question!

Dear Pay Dirt, * Your letter signoff Your pronouns Your email (optional and confidential—please include if you're open to Pay Dirt following up) Submit\\n\\nDear Pay Dirt,\\n\\nMy workplace recently began funding a health savings account (HSA) for each employee on our High-Deductible Health Plan. We also have the option to invest the money in our HSA with a variety of vehicles and varying levels of involvement. Among my colleagues, there’s fiery debate about whether it’s better to use the HSA purely as a retirement account and pay out-of-pocket for health care costs (when financially possible), or whether the earmarking of the money specifically for health care means we should spend that first, and (when possible) build retirement savings with other types of IRAs. Does it matter how well our HSA investments are doing when we make that decision? What other factors should we consider?\\n\\n—Maybe I Just Won’t Get Sick\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDear Maybe,\\n\\nFor readers who might not know, anHSA is a tax-advantaged savings account used to pay for medical expenses, like copays, emergency room visits, prescriptions, dental care and so on. HSAs are usually offered as part of a high deductible health plan (HDHP), which is a type of health insurance plan where you pay lower premiums in exchange for higher out-of-pocket costs.\\n\\nHSAs have a few big perks. First, the money you save in it is tax-free. This means you don’t pay income tax on the contributions you make to the account, the money grows without being taxed, and as long as the withdrawals are used for qualified medical expenses, they are not taxed either. And once you hit 65, you can even use the money in your HSA for non-medical expenses without paying a penalty (though you’ll pay regular income tax on those withdrawals, like you would with a Traditional IRA). Other health plans come with the option of a Flexible Spending Account, which you can fund with tax free dollars but these are use-it-or-lose-it and expire after a single year (or a year plus a short grace period).\\n\\nBecause of the benefits, there’s some debate over how to optimize an HSA—should you spend it on medical expenses now (which can include surprising items like sunscreen, condoms, and contact lenses), or treat it like a retirement fund and leave your money in it while it grows? Some people, like your colleagues, it seems, swear by the “HSA as a retirement account” approach. The idea is to pay for medical expenses out-of-pocket whenever possible so your HSA money can keep growing tax-free. It’s a valid point —if you take the money out, you miss out on that tax-free growth. Plus, since health care costs tend to go up as you approach your retirement years, this strategy offers a dedicated pot of money to cover things like Medicare premiums and long-term care. This approach works best if you have the financial flexibility to cover medical costs now, of course. It also assumes you’ve got good investment options in your HSA—a robust menu of funds that will give you a healthy balance of risk and return with low fees. Those options depend on the financial institution administering the account.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOn the flip side, if you’re thinking more in terms of immediate benefit, using your HSA for medical expenses now may be the way to go. Spending from your HSA now means you’re getting the tax-free benefit right away and perhaps even avoid potential changes to HSA rules in the future. This strategy makes more sense if you have frequent medical costs, limited cash flow, or if the investment options in your HSA aren’t great.\\n\\nSo how much does it matter how well your investments are doing? If the funds in your HSA are growing steadily with low fees, the retirement approach might be worth it. (The New York Times even ran an article recently on how it’s possible to become a millionaire with an HSA, though there are a ton of caveats.) But if the investment options are underwhelming — the fees are high, the growth is slow or volatile —it could make more sense to use the HSA for medical expenses and invest your money elsewhere. But your own comfort with market volatility and the level of risk you’re willing to take on with your investments can also influence this decision.\\n\\nOther factors to consider: how much you’re already saving for retirement, whether your employer contributes to your HSA, and how much they contribute. Employer contributions are, in some ways, like getting free money, especially since they’re often made pre-tax, which can boost your savings. Maximizing those contributions by contributing to the HSA yourself (and allowing it to grow) could be a smart strategy.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIf you can afford to pay for medical expenses out-of-pocket, letting your HSA grow can indeed be a smart move. But if you’d rather have the peace of mind of using those tax-free dollars now, that’s a solid choice too. It depends on your financial situation and what feels right for you. There’s no one-size-fits-all answer here, but there are definitely key factors to consider to make the best decision for yourself. Ultimately, you can take comfort in knowing that your HSA is only one (potential) piece of your long term financial puzzle. You’re clearly thinking thoughtfully about your money, and whatever strategy you choose to pursue here, it isn’t a make-or-break decision.\\n\\n—Kristin\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMore Advice From Slate\\n\\nMy best friend is the mother of two impeccably behaved daughters—at least according to my friend. The girls (ages 7 and 4) generally play quietly together. My son (also 4) is, in contrast, a tornado. A sweet one, for sure, but my partner and I do need to provide lots of focused activities to temper his extra energy. For the most part, the three kids play well together, but if my son overreacts to something (which he often does), my friend overreacts in turn! It bothers me how harshly she speaks to him and how critical of him she is in general.\"},\n",

Beginning in 2018, I started going for regular massages (every 6-8 weeks) at a nearby massage franchise location, where I am a member. For most of that time, I would try to stick with an LMT I liked, but distance and scheduling made it hard. Then about 18 months ago, I switched to a location near my work since it was easier to find available appointments during lunch breaks. A few months after joining that location, I took an available appointment with a male LMT and have been booking with him ever since.\\n\\nReasons for that: 1. He is usually free during the times when I have breaks in my work schedule.\\n\\n2. He is a very good massage therapist.\\n\\nTo be honest with you and myself, I also liked the way he approached massages in ways that aren’t COMPLETELY related to zoning in and relieving muscle tension. For example, he’s not so overly concerned with blanket placement/modesty that he neglects areas that need attention like upper glutes and pecs. Less related and hard to describe is the overall feeling that he wasn’t just focusing on one section while making sure to avoid touching anything else. It definitely felt more personal and a bit suggestive but not overtly sexual. And, I definitely find him attractive. However, I wasn’t flirtatious or throwing eyes at him during the few minutes we talked before each massage. And he didn’t seem to be with me either, just the normal pleasant and low-key charming demeanor.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWell apparently, I’m oblivious as shit! Last session turned into an erotic massage and then some. I was definitely receptive to it, it was consensual, and a damn fun time. I have no idea how often he engages in stuff like this, but I doubt I’m so desirable that I am the only one. I just know I’d be down for it to continue, if we both wanted to.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHere is my question: From what I have gathered about these types of massage franchises, the owners would probably be displeased that anything like this was going on. It would open them up to legal action and bad publicity. He could be fired and/or lose his license. Yes, he is an adult and responsible for his own actions. Is that where I need to stop, in regards to thinking about the potential ramifications? Should I talk with him before our next session to see … I don’t know what? The higher-ups turn a blind eye if it’s loyal clients and he’s “vetted” them for a year? If he is concerned about ramifications, and if so how concerned? What types of consequence could I face if this all went tits-up?\\n\\n— Interdisciplinary Methods of Stress-Relief\\n\\nDear Stress Relief,\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhile it is not unheard of for those who patronize “happy ending” massage parlors to face criminal charges, the majority of stings/raids target those who manage and work at such establishments. Generally, that’s how it works in U.S. culture: The sex worker is stigmatized for providing in-demand goods. I want to make sure you understand, though, that your risk is not zero. In 2019, police arrested 20 men as a result of an investigation of a massage parlor in Rockville, Maryland—according to the cops, all of them had freely admitted to paying for sex when questioned. Also in 2019, hundreds of men were arrested for buying sex in a crackdown on multiple spas in Florida—many of these men were caught on video engaged in sexual contact with the massage therapists. Even with that kind of seemingly incontrovertible proof, though, many saw their charges dropped for lack of evidence of cash exchange on camera. See, it’s much more difficult to catch clients, who typically pass through for brief periods of time. Barring the kind of (potentially unreliable) video evidence mentioned, you’d typically have to be caught with your pants literally down during a raid and even then, you might escape prosecution. (Though just being arrested is its own hassle.) The punishment will vary by state—the Rockville guys were charged with one count of “prostitution-general,” which carried fines of $500 and/or a year in jail.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe risk here is probably along the lines of illegal drug use, which many people engage in despite the well-publicized consequences. You can keep getting booty bumped by this guy with or without a conversation, though I think a chat might bring with it a sense of tension that could lessen the likelihood of future diddling. I think your task is to decide whether this is worth the risk, or whether you should find a new masseur—they’re everywhere and a lot of them will stay away from your genitalia without even being asked.\\n\\nDear How to Do It,\\n\\nI’m struggling with a kinky catch-22. I’ve been reading freaky porn since I was a kid—nonconsensual, humiliation, etc.—and it’s still what gets me off, but I can’t seem to read it anymore. Unless I’m actively horny to start with, it makes me embarrassed and anxious and ashamed. I think those feelings have been there for a while, which is why I was shifting towards more “consensual non-consent” or roleplay stories the last time I read much porn—which was when I was pregnant a couple years ago. But now even that is too awkward to contemplate unless I’m already worked up. Other porn is boring though.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMy sex life has always been a bit complicated—between anxiety, teenage touch starvation, dysphoria, and a masturbation technique that’s hard to replicate in company, I’ve ended up mostly getting myself off and treating sex as a fun thing to do with a partner rather than a method for orgasm. But I do need to be at least a little bit horny for it to be fun! And that doesn’t seem to happen spontaneously! My partner will ask if I’m just asexual or whatever but is struggling with the uncertainty of being attracted to someone whose libido is a Rubik’s Cube.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI’ve been on hormonal birth control for over a decade (aside from the two pregnancies), but I’m currently using an IUD which I understood to have the lowest dose. It seems possible that this is just my baseline and my libido was unusually high when the hormones of adolescence and pregnancy were involved.\\n\\nI have no trouble coming once I’m in the mood, but how do I get in the mood when the stuff I used to enjoy actively distresses me?\\n\\n— Self-Exasperated\\n\\nDear Self-Exasperated,\\n\\nThis is indeed a catch-22. Probably the easiest thing to do would just to refrain from any sexual activity, including masturbation, until you’re horny. What it sounds like is happening is that your disgust threshold is lowering when you’re in the mood, which is quite common (Jesse Bering writes about this in Perv). Something that might keep us going once turned on may seem repellent in less libidinous times. It’s ok to let your body guide you into a sex schedule that is less active than what might seem “normal.” Don’t let your partner’s questions convince you that there’s something wrong with you. You do report being “actively horny to start with” sometimes, which indicates some kind of spontaneous desire. It might also be possible to cultivate desire in the act. You shouldn’t push yourself to the point of discomfort, but starting to engage in sex when you aren’t 100 percent turned on could result in your desire growing as the sex progresses. Sometimes it’s worth giving things a try, especially if your accelerator is prone to moving slowly.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOtherwise, attempt to cultivate varied porn taste through varied exposure. Focus on stuff that you know you won’t feel bad about later. Try a range of styles and kinks. Or go off porn entirely and rely on fantasy. I don’t expect any of this to be easy—it will require an active process. But then, you specifically wrote in to avoid doing things the usual, easy, way. Now you have the burden of actually making it happen.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHelp us keep giving the advice you crave every week. Sign up for Slate Plus now.\\n\\nDear How to Do It,\\n\\nMy husband (58) and I (52) have been married for four years now. This is my second marriage and his third. We’ve been together for a total of seven years. A couple of years ago, my husband’s ex commented on a Facebook post about a vehicle we were selling. This ex had stirred up trouble in the beginning of our relationship (she was supposed to be blocked on Facebook) and he knows how I feel about her, but he assured me they were through. Shortly after that incident I caught him masturbating to a porn video on his phone. I truly feel that he was watching his ex in the video; however, he denied that she was in the video. I have never known him to masturbate and as far as I knew he hadn’t done it since.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe other night I was using his phone, and I saw on open window with porn. Of course, my mind goes directly to the ex, although I did not bring her up when we talked about it and she was not on the screen. He says he just enjoys watching porn and it has nothing to do with me or how he feels about me. The last two years have been very unkind to me and my immediate family. We have had one death which we expected due to an illness but we’ve had two deaths that were sudden and unexpected. I have also had a lot of health issues. Due to some depression I have slacked on a lot of things such as letting the house work go longer than I should, not being very active outside of my home, my personal care, and I have gained 35 pounds since getting married. I don’t feel good about myself at all. For a while now, I’ve felt that we were drifting apart, but when I try to have a conversation with him, he states everything is fine. He will not really even talk about the porn. Is this something some men do? Is he looking at porn because I don’t fully satisfy him? Do we need to have sex more frequently? I know we love one another, and I’m willing to do my part to save our relationship, as long as he isn’t speaking to his ex again.\\n\\n— Is My Marriage in Trouble?\\n\\nDear Marriage in Trouble,\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhile it’s certainly possible that the person in the video was your husband’s ex, you’ve given no reason why you think it was her (you didn’t, for example, indicate that she works in porn), so I think we can chalk that one up to anxiety.\\n\\nAs for the masturbation stuff, I wonder if you’ve ever heard the old joke (it’s at this point a cliché, really) that 90 percent of men masturbate and the rest are liars. (Sometimes the word “people” replaces men, though I think the reason the statement has been often gendered is because traditionally masturbation has been expected of men and not of women, which is dumb.) In any event, a lot of people jerk off, irrespective of their sex lives. It’s its own thing, not necessarily compensatory. There isn’t really a zero-sum to achieve—people who enjoy sex still masturbate, and often when they masturbate they look at porn. It’s true that your husband may desire more frequent orgasms than he’s getting through sex with you, but even if there’s something practical there, he’s taking care of it. It’s a good thing. You don’t “need” to have sex with him any more than you are inclined to—it’s in his hands.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI think this discovery of yours that he enjoys watching porn might also be a good thing. It endowed you with knowledge. I don’t mean to come off as condescending, but you seem a bit naive about this stuff. You could hardly be faulted for that—the state of sex education in the U.S. (and a lot of the world, for that matter) is abysmal. If you want to learn more about what people enjoy, often within the confines of a monogamous relationship, I recommend Ian Kerner’s modern sex manual So Tell Me About the Last Time You Had Sex: Laying Bare and Learning to Repair Our Love Lives. And for more on relationships and keeping the spark, check out another entry in the HTDI canon, Esther Perel’s Mating in Captivity.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDid you write this or another letter we answered? Tell us what happened at howtodoit@slate.com.\\n\\nDear How to Do It,\\n\\nI need advice on how to move forward regarding what looks like an emotional affair. My partner “Mike” and I have been together for ten years. We own our home jointly and have made plans for our life into retirement and beyond. We both have professional careers, individual hobbies, and both mutual and individual friendships. Mike has always tended to have female friends, and it hasn’t bothered me until recently. The intensity of Mike’s relationship with our mutual friend “Tracey” started to worry me earlier this year. Mike’s primary method of communication with most people is via text, but he texts Tracey a LOT.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nJealousy got the better of me, and I did a bad thing. I read their messages. I found nothing overtly sexual, but their conversations definitely cross a boundary. He refers to her as his “beautiful, funny friend.” She expresses her gratitude for his support and “hopes he knows how much she loves and appreciates him.” In one conversation he invited her to come by and watch a movie when I will be gone for the holidays and said, “But no snuggling … unless you insist.”\\n\\nWithout telling him I’d read their messages, I told him I was becoming uncomfortable with his involvement with Tracey and asked him to explain the nature of their relationship. Mike called it a heavy flirtation, admitted feelings for her, and said he would cut off contact. When I asked if he considered what he was doing an emotional affair, he acted confused about the definition. Mike insists he does not want to jeopardize our relationship and says he will do whatever I want in order to make things right. I’m angry with both of them, but I haven’t spoken to Tracey about it. She is one of my oldest friends, and it hurts to think of ending our friendship. Am I making too big a deal out of their flirtation or am I being a sucker by taking Mike at his word? Should I cut Tracey out of my life, and if so, should I explain why?\\n\\n— Where to Go From Here?\\n\\nDear From Here,\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nYou would certainly be justified to cut Tracey out of your life, and to break up with Mike. They went behind your back and engaged in behavior that was outside of the terms of your relationship. They betrayed you and trust is the cornerstone of any relationship, platonic or not.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut allow me to share my nonmonogamist perspective with you: You don’t have to cut her out. You’re already hurt, why hurt yourself more by ending a friendship? Maybe you see it differently, but in my view, this transgression is pretty low stakes in the scheme of things. And anyway, forgiveness here wouldn’t just be for Tracey—it would favor you as well, as you’d get to hold onto your friendship. People fall short of monogamous ideals all the time, and proximity is seductive. Affection is a difficult thing to regulate. You can draw up boundaries, but for a lot of us, to be friendly is to be affectionate, and affection is an unlimited resource.\\n\\nI’m not saying that you have to adopt these ideals, but I am saying that you don’t have to let this thing do more damage than it has already done.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s a fuzziness to the wrong done here—“emotional affair” is a category like “creative genius” in that many people think they know what it means but there’s really not an agreed-upon standard. Mike may have been feigning naïveté when you confronted him with that term, or maybe it just never occurred to him that what he was doing could be described as such. In any case, emotions flow freely and humans are permeable. I think exercising some compassion for Mike and Tracey—two people who found a certain fondness for each other as a result of circumstance—might be the most constructive move here, but it would require a good degree of patience, a determination to be the biggest person in the party, and perhaps a deviation from your trusted morality. Maybe that’s too much to foist on you, but if you want to continue to have these people in your life, some version of that will have to occur to move forward. A group talk in which you are able to calmly and clearly enumerate your grievances and draw up a map for the future could work. Decide what you’re comfortable with in terms of Tracey and Mike’s ongoing communication and prescribe it to the two of them. If you’re able to be sensible and level-headed about this, you can avoid chaos. Again, it’s asking a lot of you, especially since you didn’t ask for any of this, but if you want to make it through this with the least amount of collateral damage, you’re going to have to take the reins. Good luck!\\n\\n— Rich\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMore Advice From Slate\\n\\nMy wife and I have been happily married for 14 years, and being that we were fairly young (20s) when we got married and in a pretty religious area, we haven’t been very exploratory with sex. Recently, during foreplay, I changed things up and asked her to guide my fingers while they were on her, and then we switched and I guided her fingers while she touched herself. It was new and fun! It’s now part of our regular business because I love watching her touch herself, and it frees my hands up so I can grab tight or wander when I know she’s going to finish. Masturbating is looked down upon in our religious beliefs, and she admitted she felt guilty the first few times …'},\n",

       "   'content': \"Dear Prudence is Slate’s advice column. Delia Cai is filling in as Prudie for Jenée Desmond-Harris while she’s on parental leave. Submit questions here.\\n\\nDear Prudence,\\n\\nMy husband and his brother have been almost entirely estranged since their father died more than three years ago. There was no will, so my husband was tasked with managing all the ins and outs of the estate. Their childhood home sold for much less than hoped (poor upkeep, and a surprise reverse mortgage that came to light in the 11th hour), and my brother-in-law blamed my husband for his subsequent financial woes.\\n\\nFast forward to today: My mother-in-law is planning a joint family trip for us all. She wants to take all her grandkids to Disney World “before it’s too late.” That’s right - Disney. With all of us.\\n\\nBIL has said he’d “put differences aside” to make MIL happy, but … it all feels fake. It IS fake. I don’t think there’s any reality in which they can work out these “differences,” let alone in time for a vacation later this year. I know this trip is a bad idea, and general advice would be to avoid it altogether, to not spend time with people pretending everything is “OK…” But this trip is happening whether I like it or not. Sending the kids solo with grandma is not an option, so, how would you suggest I handle it all? What’s the best way to shield my kids on a trip that will likely include obvious fighting and drama?\\n\\n—Trip Trapped\\n\\nDear Trapped,\\n\\nIf I were in your shoes, I would strongly encourage your husband to have a one-on-one meeting (or phone call) with his brother before the family trip, because Disney World with the whole family in tow is not going to be the ideal setting for their first encounter. They do not have to magically reconcile all in one go; the two of them simply need to discuss some basic expectations for this trip truce (i.e. how long is it? Who’s paying for what? What conversation topics are off-limits for the trip or in front of the kids?). It’s in no one’s interest to start figuring all of this out once you’re surrounded by thousands of other families who are also barely getting along.\\n\\nAdditionally, either with your husband or on your own, I would sit the kids down and tell them that it’s possible that Dad and Uncle “Joe” may not always be feeling their best during this trip, and when that happens, they might have to take breaks. And then I think you and your husband need to have a chat about how to best structure the trip so that he has those breaks, plus plenty of adult venting time. You also should have some time where you don’t have to play peacekeeper 24/7. Take it one day at a time, and rely on the “not feeling well” excuse when the tension is palpable. Kids pick up on that, and it’s better to take a break than to try to force through it with plastered smiles—there will already be enough of those around.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGet advice—submit a question!

I was very much the big sibling: I looked out for Tim, gave him advice, and found him really entertaining. This dynamic persisted for a while, and two years ago, I probably would have called Tim one of my best friends.\\n\\nOver time, though, the lopsidedness of our friendship started bothering me more and more. Tim really values my opinion and turns to me for support and guidance often; meanwhile, I see Tim as sweet but immature, and he’s not so high on the list of people I’d turn to with hard questions. Part of the issue is that I don’t think Tim has grown up very much in the years we’ve been friends, which has made the gap between us feel bigger. It also means the things I found fun and funny about him in the beginning—things that helped balance the scales of our relationship—strike me as a little juvenile now. Tim has also changed a fair amount in the years I’ve known him—he’s let go of certain passions that made him interesting to me when we met, and in general has become a more isolated person.\\n\\nOne more thing: Tim came out as trans and has been transitioning in the time we’ve been friends (I’m using a name and pronouns that are consistent with his gender identity). I’ve been very supportive throughout the whole process, and have thought very hard about whether some internalized transphobia is contributing to how I’m feeling, but I’m certain now that it’s not. Still, I’m including this information just to say—he’s been going through something big! Which makes me feel all the worse about wanting distance from him.\\n\\nAs I said, I’ve been feeling this way about our relationship for a year and a half now, and I still don’t know how to proceed. At this point, I see Tim about once a month (mainly when he initiates), but that’s still more time than I’d like to dedicate to a friendship that isn’t fulfilling right now. Still, I feel frozen between two kinds of guilt: the guilt of dodging Tim or otherwise not reciprocating his friendship, and the guilt of persisting in a friendship mainly out of obligation. Tim still considers me one of his best friends, and loves me very deeply—which makes all of this that much harder. What would you do?\\n\\n—Fair-Weather Friend\\n\\nDear Fair-Weather friend,\\n\\nAs someone who loves playing “Big Sibling” in many a friendship dynamic, I feel you. It’s fun until the imbalance starts to grate, and then it just sort of feels thankless and frustrating, especially when you both start growing apart—which is what seems to be happening for you and Tim. But I can imagine that the combination of Tim’s increased isolation and his experience with a major life change, i.e. his transition, makes it feel like you can’t really abandon him now.\\n\\nIn situations like these where you want more distance in a friendship, it’s tempting to try to gently fade out, hoping that the other person gets the picture. But I think that’s actual abandonment. It’s much kinder to address the tension directly, because you can give some reassurance about what your desire for distance is really about (i.e. if you just start ghosting, he’ll start coming up with his own reasons why).\\n\\nI would get together with Tim one-on-one and say something along these lines: “Hey, I care about you, and I know that this is an important time in your life. But I also have to be honest about how I’ve been feeling like we’re growing apart for a while, and I was wondering if we could take a few months of space so that I can figure out some stuff going on with me, and what I would want from a friendship going forward.” This might read as a watered-down version of “It’s not you, it’s me,” but the sentiment is true: You want something different from this relationship, and you’re now asking for some time and space to figure it out.\\n\\nMaybe during these months apart, you find that you miss Tim and want to restore your friendship exactly as it was; maybe you’ll realize that what you really want is to change up the format of your hang-outs (i.e. less catching up, more activities). Or maybe you’ll just realize you’re better at supporting Tim from some distance until he grows up a little more. And that’s okay, too. The important thing is that you are honest with Tim about your needs, which keeps the bridge for any kind of future connection intact.\\n\\nDear Prudence,\\n\\nI grew up in a small, tight-knit family—my parents immigrated to the U.S. as teens, but mostly maintained the values of their culture rather than assimilating to American culture. They never really discussed politics when I was growing up, however, they’ve increasingly become consumed by conservative politics, probably partially a side effect of the extremely white Republican community they’ve lived in for 20-plus years. I’m often left speechless by their points-of-view, which can feel like grab-quotes from Fox News and are downright bigoted and insensitive. There’s a lot I can’t talk about without them turning it into some conservative agenda, even though I avoid talking politics at all costs. It makes it difficult for me to share my life in any deep or meaningful way. I don’t feel like I know them anymore, not as I did in my youth.\\n\\nMy parents are now in their 70s. I feel sad that we’ve drifted in this way, though I don’t think they even notice, and I have no idea how to cope. I text them every day, and I call them every so often. Usually the conversations are fine, but lack any substance or depth. I feel like I’m mourning them before I’ve even lost them, and I want to find some way to connect with them in their later years, knowing that I won’t have all the time in the world with them. But I have no idea how to.\\n\\n—Prematurely Missing My Parents\\n\\nDear Missing My Parents,\\n\\nYou’re craving connection with your parents, but it seems like your current method of calling/texting to catch up isn’t getting you what you want. A lot of parents, no matter their age, aren’t terribly great with gabbing simply to gab—there needs to be a “third thing” in the room to talk about (i.e. the TV) or you need to be experiencing something together (which can be as simple as going for a walk and looking at stuff). Assuming that you don’t live in the same place as your parents where you can organize such activities, I think you have to get creative about figuring out a “third thing” to share—one that isn’t Fox News. (Because the real function of Fox News, or any other media, really, is to give people something to talk to each other about.)\\n\\nAre there existing hobbies or activities that your parents enjoy, such as cooking, sewing, gardening, bird-watching, or watching specific TV shows/movies that you could use to bond over? It doesn’t even have to be a big formal thing; my mother and I have primarily bonded in recent months over sending animal-related TikToks to each other. It’s not the ideal relationship I want with her, but after a few years of major conflict and resentment, it’s what we both need to rebuild a basic level of enjoyment and trust with each other. I think that’s what you need, too. You and your parents all need a shared “third thing” to establish a basic bond before everyone feels connected enough to have more conversations “of substance,” as you say. At the end of the day, feeling understood by your parents is certainly the goal, but giggling together (even over silly videos) still counts as time well spent.\\n\\n—Delia\\n\\nCatch up on this week’s Prudie.\\n\\nMore Advice From Slate\\n\\nI live in a huge apartment complex with about 500 tenants. I happen to live on the back side of the complex, with a window facing the dumpster in the alleyway. Many of the maintenance workers hang out in that alley when they’re not working. I’ve been working from home for six months now, meaning I spend way more time overhearing their conversations than I used to.\"}],\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-23T18:23:36',\n",
       "   'content': 'It\\'s hard to believe it\\'s been 50 years since the release of The Stepford Wives, a film based on the 1972 novel of the same name by Ira Levin. It might not be to everyone\\'s taste, but its lasting cultural influence is undeniable. A psychological horror/thriller with a hint of sci-fi, the film spawned multiple made-for-TV sequels and a campy 2004 remake, as well as inspiring one of the main characters in the hit series Desperate Housewives. The term \"Stepford wife\" became part of our shared cultural lexicon, and Jordan Peele even cited the film as one of the key influences for his 2017 masterpiece Get Out.\\n\\n(Spoilers below for the novel and both film adaptations.)\\n\\nLevin\\'s novels were a hot commodity in Hollywood at the time, especially after the success of his most famous novel, Rosemary\\'s Baby (1967), adapted into a 1968 horror film starring Mia Farrow. (The novels A Kiss Before Dying, The Boys from Brazil, Sliver, and Levin\\'s play Deathtrap were also adapted to film.) The plot of the The Stepford Wives film follows the novel\\'s plot fairly closely.\\n\\nKatharine Ross stars as Joanna Eberhart, a young wife and mother and aspiring photographer who moves with her family to the seemingly idyllic fictional Connecticut suburb of Stepford at her husband Walter\\'s (Peter Masterson) insistence. She bonds with sassy fellow newcomer Bobbie (Paula Prentiss) over scotch and Ring Dings (and their respective messy kitchens), mutually marveling at the vacuous behavior of the other neighborhood wives.\\n\\nThere are soon hints that all is not right in Stepford. Carol (Nanette Newman) has a bit too much to drink at a garden party and begins to glitch. Together with dissatisfied trophy wife Charmaine (Tina Louise), Joanna and Bobbie hold a women\\'s \"consciousness raising\" meeting (aka a bitching session), only to have it devolve into the other wives raving about the time-saving merits of Easy On spray starch. Meanwhile, Walter has joined the exclusive Stepford Men\\'s Association and becomes increasingly secretive and distant.\\n\\nWhen Charmaine suddenly transforms into yet another vapid housewife after a weekend getaway with her husband, Joanna and Bobbie become suspicious and decide to investigate. They discover that there used to be a women\\'s group in Stepford—headed by Carol, no less—but all the transformed wives suddenly lost interest. Is it something in the water causing the transformation? That turns out to be a dead end, but one clue is that the creepy head of the Men\\'s Association, Dale \"Diz\" Coba (Patrick O\\'Neal), used to work for Disney building animatronics. (When Diz first tells Joanna about his background, she says she doesn\\'t believe it: \"You don\\'t look like someone who enjoys making people happy.\" Her instincts are correct.)'},\n",

       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': \"If you can’t spend an hour or two with Colman Domingo in real life, you can still find the key to his spirit—the sense of the joy he both draws from the world and puts back into it—in a family photograph from Easter 1976. There’s Colman at age 6, a pint-size gent perched between his older sister and brother, wearing a candy-striped blazer so groovy you wouldn’t be surprised to see it on Sammy Davis Jr. at a Cocoanut Grove show. Elegant and poised, he gazes straight at the camera, his legs crossed just so. He brought this picture along when he appeared on The View in late November, and after the show’s hosts had finished cooing over its adorableness, he provided the backstory: The navy pants he’s wearing in the photo had a matching jacket, but it was too small. He grabbed the striped one instead, though his mother observed that it didn’t quite match. “But it makes me feel good!” he told her, and instead of arguing, she told him, “Wear what makes you feel good,” setting him on the path he follows to this day.\\n\\nDomingo, now 55, is known for his creative yet classic red-carpet style, inspired by influences ranging from Fred Astaire to the Ohio Players, Cary Grant to Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes—it makes perfect sense that he’s been named one of the chairs of this spring’s Met Gala, the theme of which is “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” Style is integral to Domingo’s spirit, as a way of communicating, of pushing out into the world, of connecting with Black men and women who came before him—which is to say that anyone who believes style is superficial hasn’t met Domingo. How he dresses, how he moves, even how he sips from a coffee cup: all these things are so casually entwined with who he is—as a performer, certainly, but also as a writer, director, producer, and, just generally speaking, a person who’s alive to the world—that they charge the air around him.\\n\\nGenerosity begins with the self, and Domingo is so at ease that he has extra grace to spare. In a politically and emotionally precarious world, where people seem to have stopped caring for one another, those molecules of grace are like gold. “Everything I do is about radical love,” Domingo says, over a coffee at the Chelsea Hotel in New York City. “It's about seeing each other. What am I doing as a creative? It's about getting people to think, maybe helping people think differently. You know, that's all I can do. The macro I can't take care of. But I can take care of the micro.”\\n\\nPhotograph by Campbell Addy for TIME\\n\\nClick here to order your copy of this issue\\n\\nDomingo has earned a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for his superb performance in Sing Sing, Greg Kwedar’s drawn-from-real-life film about men who find redemption through a prison theater program. This is Domingo’s second nomination in as many years: he was also recognized for his turn, both charming and fiery, as civil rights activist Bayard Rustin in George C. Wolfe’s 2023 biopic Rustin. (He’s the first actor to be nominated two years in a row since Denzel Washington, who earned nods for Fences, in 2017, and Roman J. Israel, Esq., the following year.) He’s the anchor of Netflix’s multipart thriller The Madness, in which he plays a media pundit who stumbles into a murder plot in the woods of the Poconos. And the projects he’s got going, for 2025 and beyond, stack far into the sky: He plays patriarch Joe Jackson in Antoine Fuqua’s upcoming Michael Jackson biopic and stars in Tina Fey’s upcoming series The Four Seasons, a reimagining of Alan Alda’s 1981 comedy. He’s ready to direct and star in a Nat King Cole biopic he’s written, and to direct a drama about the romance between Sammy Davis Jr. and Kim Novak too.\\n\\nBut even if the spotlight around Domingo now seems particularly bright, he has in fact been everywhere for a while now: In the early 2000s he splashed out in Broadway shows like Passing Strange and The Scottsboro Boys, garnering a Tony nomination for the latter. In 2022 he won a Primetime Emmy for his recurring role in Euphoria. Moviegoers know him from pictures like Lincoln, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, Zola, and The Color Purple.\\n\\nStill, after working as one sort of performer or another for some 35 years, he’s grateful for—and more than a little surprised at—all the extra attention he’s gotten in the past five years or so. “How can I say it? I did not intend for this at all. I wanted to be a respected actor, and I found my work as a character actor mostly in the theater. I feel like that's where I was most useful, and that's where I was best being served.” As he began to take more television roles, opportunities began shifting. “It felt like the roles were meeting me and I was meeting the roles.” Now, he knows exactly how fortunate he is, and he’s also in a place where he can effect change for others. “I’m like, ‘Oooh, I get to have an impact? What can I do? What can I disrupt?’” He laughs, a great, sonorous laugh that sounds as if it could have rolled in from the ocean, even though Domingo was born and grew up in West Philly. “That's what I want to do, and really do it in the most loving, gracious, generous way possible.”\\n\\n****\\n\\nOne of Domingo’s early gigs was as a “party starter” for bar mitzvahs, getting recalcitrant guests out on the dance floor. Though he has no formal dance training, he moves through the world on springy, lily-stem legs, and it’s hard to imagine Mrs. Rosensweig, or anyone, resisting his effervescence. But given the way he carries himself in every interaction, it’s likely Domingo offered something else too: not just charm and fancy footwork but safety, the feeling that, if you join him, he’ll have your back.\\n\\nFor his appearance on The View, he invited his two nieces—one is actually a family friend, but he considers her family—to hang out in the greenroom with him beforehand and later watch the show from the audience. And to observe him with family—or even the small cadre of assistants on hand to make the day go smoothly—is to see a man who doesn’t think twice before opening a door for others, literally or figuratively. It’s not only fun to be around him, but almost calming—as if he were looking after the welfare of everyone in his orbit, even amid all the demands that come with being a hardworking performer and, now, a truly famous person.\\n\\nHis friends seem to feel that way too. Writer-director-actor Bradley Cooper met Domingo when the two found themselves on the awards circuit last year, Cooper for his Leonard Bernstein biopic Maestro and Domingo for Rustin. “I think it was like a CAA party after the Golden Globes or something,” Cooper says by phone from New York. “I went up to him, and we had a wonderful conversation. He was just a luminous human being.” The two exchanged numbers and have since built a friendship. Domingo says Cooper has been a great sounding board for his Nat King Cole project; Cooper demurs—he doesn’t think he’s helped that much—but he values having a friend he can talk to about projects that matter. “It's always nice to talk to somebody who's going down or has gone down a similar path,” he says, “and whenever he wants to talk about anything, I would just share my experience and things that I've learned and need to work on, or want to work on. Anytime he's asked me something, I actually feel privileged that he even wants my input.” Cooper is also, simply, happy to have found a true friend. “As you get older, you tend not to make new friends. But I made a new friend, which is kind of wonderful. And he allows that space to be a friend to somebody, which is beautiful.”\\n\\nColman Domingo photographed in London on Jan. 19 Campbell Addy for TIME\\n\\nDomingo, like Cooper, has ideas to spare. He’s eager to take on bigger and more ambitious projects—more disruption of the loving, gracious, generous kind. But like lots of successful people, he’s earned his self-assurance day-by-day. He never thought the career he has now was a sure thing. “I'm happy that I'm being met in this moment on my terms, in the way that I wanted to be seen. I didn't have to become some kind of other artist, who has to leave parts of themselves behind. I bring all of me into it. I bring all my years as a theater practitioner, as a director, as a writer, as a producer. Even when the industry wanted me to just pick one.”\\n\\nBy showcasing his talent across film and TV, Domingo has broadened his scope in a way that allows him to share the wealth. All through 2024, as studio and streaming execs balked at greenlighting risky or ambitious projects—even as many who make their living in TV and movies were still scrambling to recover not just from the pandemic, but from the actors’ and writers’ strikes—the motto of many who’d seen work dry up was “Survive till ‘25.” And that was before so many lost their homes in the horrific Los Angeles wildfires. (Domingo’s house, in Malibu, was spared.) So while he’s riding high, he’s using his career not just to gain recognition for himself but also to help determine which stories get told. In other words, it isn’t just about climbing higher; it’s about lifting others.\\n\\nHis involvement with Sing Sing, as both an actor and an executive producer, is a case in point. When he signed on to play John “Divine G” Whitfield—a man, wrongly imprisoned, who finds a lifeline in the performing arts—director and co-writer Kwedar, along with the film’s other writers and producers, suggested a parity model in which everyone involved would be paid the same rate. Domingo loved the idea. “My heart just opened. I don’t know if it works for every project. But I think there are elements of it that can work, especially when it comes to low-budget features. You're doing it because you love it, and you want to be a part of it.” And when the project succeeds, everyone benefits, not just a few people at the top. “I think that's just fair,” Domingo says. “So when we did sell the movie to A24, the most beautiful thing was to know the checks were being written out to every single department, and every person. That felt so good and so meaningful, especially right now, when the industry is having an existential crisis. This model can help be a game changer, so that everyone feels respected.”\\n\\nColman Domingo photographed in London on Jan. 19 Campbell Addy for TIME\\n\\nDomingo’s Sing Sing co-star, Clarence Maclin, is a veteran of the real-life prison program that inspired the film, Rehabilitation Through the Arts, and one of the many formerly incarcerated men who have roles in the movie. He plays a version of himself, a man whose capacity for growth expands when he becomes involved with the program. Maclin, who’d gotten his acting training at Sing Sing, with its terrible acoustics and, as he puts it, “sucky sound system,” knew how to project; Domingo helped him tailor his performance to the intimacy of the camera lens. But what Maclin took from their collaboration goes beyond mere tips about technique. “He’s the genuine article when it comes to someone who definitely is going to be there, someone who means what they say about what they want to do and what their intentions are,” Maclin says via Zoom. “The things I want to be, I see in him already, and it's like a guide.”\\n\\nThe idea, as Maclin clearly gets, is that living in the world means so much more than looking out for No. 1. We need to focus on what connects us rather than divides us. I met with Domingo three weeks after the election, at a time when many were still feeling stunned—and more than a little helplessly frozen—by the results. As a gay Black man, one who stands up for the people and causes he cares about, he knows the road ahead might be bumpy. But when he woke up on Nov. 6, he didn’t panic. Instead, “I thought, OK, this is where we are.” Again, he vibrates with so much radiant energy that it’s impossible to feel hopeless around him. A conversation with him leaves you with the feeling that he’s handing you a key; it’s up to you to find the right door to open, but you know you can do it, even if you’re not a spectacular-looking six-foot-plus movie star who moves through every space—and the world—with lanky, liquid grace. “The pendulum does swing,” he says. “My parents went through a lot, my grandparents went through even worse. And I am here, where I am in my life, but also as a proud descendant of slaves who lived, loved, and fought, and sacrificed, so I could be here. So I can't hold my head down and be sad or despondent about anything. I have to roll up my sleeves to continue to get to work: Fight, love, be joyful in a very revolutionary way.”\\n\\nThis is how you honor those who came before you while also opening a corridor for everyone who will follow. This is how you get the party started.\\n\\nSet design by Ibby Njoya; styling by Ola Ebiti; grooming by Mata Mariélle; production by Ragi Dholakia Productions; retouching by Touch Digital\"},\n",

       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': \"The three gold medals that sprinter Gabby Thomas won at the Paris Olympics last summer are currently resting in what is, she says, their proper place: her sock drawer. She’s stuck her silver and bronze from Tokyo in there too.\\n\\nThomas, 28, is in no rush to build any sort of living-room shrine to her athletic accomplishments. “The medals are truly just objects for me,” she says. “I don't look at them and genuinely feel like, ‘Oh my God, those are so cool.’” One day, she may enjoy staring at all that precious metal, as a reminder of past glories. But now is not that time. “I genuinely feel like I'm not done yet,” says Thomas. “I’m still on my journey. I'm still in that process. I have so many more to come.”\\n\\nPlus, her life is more than mere medals. When her track career comes to a close, Thomas has designs on leading a nonprofit organization like Austin’s Volunteer Healthcare Clinic, where she has helped manage fellow workers, interacted with patients—many of whom are uninsured and live in underserved Latino communities—and arranged for one of her sponsors, New Balance, to donate shoes. “What I do now only fuels that thought,” says Thomas, who wrote her master’s thesis at the University of Texas about racial disparities in sleep epidemiology, after majoring in neurobiology and global health as a Harvard undergrad. “We see the difference that we make in the community. We are, in fact, bridging that racial health disparity gap, which is really important to me.”\\n\\nOne woman who received new footwear at the clinic last spring was moved to tears and shared with Thomas that she was going through some personal turmoil. “It felt like somebody was looking out for her,” says Thomas. “You feel alone and you're in a dark place, and something so small can make a big difference.”\\n\\nAfter the Paris Olympics, where Thomas won the 200 m and pair of relay golds in the 4x100 and 4x400, she headlined Athlos NYC, a female-only track event backed by Reddit co-founder and venture capitalist Alexis Ohanian. Athlos doled out a record prize purse, including $60,000 for the winner of each of the six sprint and middle-distance races. Thomas finished second in the 200 m. Megan Thee Stallion provided the post-race entertainment. “It was a great cultural moment for us,” says Thomas. “Because when you actually look at who's running track and field, most of us are Black women. And we had an event that really celebrated that.”\\n\\nOver these past few months, Thomas has also appeared on the cover of Vogue, snapped a picture with Rihanna at an awards show, attended Fashion Week, and served as grand marshal of the New York City Marathon. Now she’s training for the upcoming season, which includes the debut of Grand Slam Track, a new league founded by legendary sprinter Michael Johnson, likely another Athlos event, and world championships, where she’ll aim to win her first individual gold. These commitments have forced her to step away from her management role at the clinic, although she still regularly checks in on patients.\\n\\nGoing into the next Olympic cycle, Thomas has started strong off the blocks. “The gold medals, while they do add pressure, have given me a lot of confidence, have truly showed me what I'm capable of,” says Thomas. “So I'm definitely looking forward to the next couple of years. The fact that LA 2028 is in America, in my home country, I just don't think it could be wrapped more beautifully for me.”\"},\n",

       "   'content': 'The Screen Actors Guild differentiates itself from other award shows by shining a spotlight directly on those who are already, well, in the spotlight. Meaning we\\'re watching an award show full of performers who know how to keep us entertained from start to finish.\\n\\nThe 31st installment of the SAG Awards was streamed live on Netflix on Sunday evening. Kristen Bell once again served as host, though she also did double duty as a nominee for Female Actor in a Comedy Series for her work in rom-com series Nobody Wants This (losing to Hacks\\' Jean Smart). Also up for nominations were the casts of movies including Anora, Conclave, A Real Pain, and Wicked, and series like Shōgun, Abbott Elementary, The Bear, and Hacks. The awards are voted on by SAG-AFTRA\\'s members and are meant to be a celebration of the work of actors by their peers. As previously announced, Jane Fonda received the 60th SAG Life Achievement Award.\\n\\nHere are some of the highlights of the show:\\n\\nRead more: The 10 Best Movie Performances of 2024\\n\\nSaddest Switcheroo\\n\\nThe show opened with Deborah Vance (Jean Smart) from Hacks prepping to host the Screen Actors Guild Awards. She and her crack team had a line-up of killer jokes about “the movie with the gay wizards” (that would be Conclave) and how to “recreate the kissing scene from Challengers with Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Kathy Bates.” However, the jokes weren’t meant to be heard, because it turns out she’s been fired from the hosting gig because she hasn’t paid her SAG dues in years. No offense to Kristen Bell, but Deborah Vance was born for this role.\\n\\nGreatest Hero’s Journey\\n\\nShrinking star Jessica Williams helped introduce the SAG Awards\\' raison d\\'être of highlighting actors on their individual journeys to mastering their chosen art form. As she sat next to her co-star Harrison Ford, she recounted, “Living my dream of getting dressed in a Starbucks’ bathroom and my dream of crying in a Del Taco bathroom after.” Never forget, the stars are just like us!\\n\\nBest Musical Number\\n\\nKristen Bell just sang a \"Frozen\" parody while a montage of every SAG Award nominee\\'s first acting gig appeared on screen pic.twitter.com/comi21lnOu — Spencer Althouse (@SpencerAlthouse) February 24, 2025\\n\\nIn her opening monologue, Bell sang a parody of the Frozen hit “Do You Want to Build a Snowman?” asking instead, “Do you want to be an actor?” while showcasing some of the very early roles of the stars in attendance. That included Kieran Culkin in Home Alone, Jodie Foster in a Coppertone ad, Timothée Chalamet as a patient in an ICU, Jason Segel eating watermelon, and more.\\n\\nBest First Responders Shout-Out\\n\\nAccording to Bell, the most attractive table at the star-spangled affair was the one filled with members of the Los Angeles Fire Department who helped battle the wildfires that recently ravaged large swaths of the city.\\n\\nBest Non-Speech\\n\\nKieran Culkin at the 31st Screen Actors Guild Awards Michael Buckner/Variety via Getty Images\\n\\nWhen Kieran Culkin took the stage to accept the award for Male Actor in a Supporting Role for his work in A Real Pain, it was clear he hadn’t prepared a speech. “Thank you SAG-AFTRA for this very heavy award,” he said, putting it down quickly because “no one can hold it for 45 seconds.” “That’s the allotted time, Adrien Brody,” he said, nodding at the nominated star of The Brutalist. As he counted down the clock, Culkin remarked: “Believe it or not this actually means a lot to me.\" With five seconds on the clock, he finally mentioned his co-star and the film\\'s writer-director, Jesse Eisenberg, but only because he wanted to thank Eisenberg’s sister who told him to cast Culkin in the film. When time was up, Culkin spit-fired the rest of his thank yous before leaving the stage.\\n\\nMost Honest Tears\\n\\nIn a room full of actors acting, Shogun star Anna Sawai appeared to genuinely cry on stage as she accepted her award for Female Actor in a Drama Series. Because while she was really happy, she was also really sad, as it was probably the last time she would be celebrating with her cast following their wins at the Emmys and Golden Globes, among other ceremonies.\\n\\nRead more: The 10 Best Movies of 2024\\n\\nBest Crossover\\n\\nKristen Bell reunited with her The Good Place co-stars Ted Danson and William Jackson Harper, but as their fake argument about who was her favorite co-star heated up, they ended up trying to recreate the kissing scene from Challengers. Sadly, the camera cut away too soon.\\n\\nBiggest Laughs\\n\\nAndrew Scott and Quinta Brunson present at the 31st Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images\\n\\n“We believe that men can be good actors, too,” said Quinta Brunson, before she and Ripley\\'s Andrew Scott presented the award for Male Actor in a Drama Series to Hiroyuki Sanada from Shogun.\\n\\nTightest Competition\\n\\nThe race for female actor in a comedy series pitted host Kristen Bell vs. presenter Quinta Brunson vs. almost-host Jean Smart vs. two co-workers (Liza Colón-Zayas and Ayo Edebiri) from The Bear. The category was anyone’s for the taking, but Smart ultimately took the prize for Hacks.\\n\\nBest Timesaver\\n\\nNeither Hacks star Jean Smart nor Only Murders in the Building actor Martin Short were on hand to collect their respective awards, which kept the show moving along at a quick clip. It’s unfortunate, though, as it was Short’s first SAG Award and both of these comedy icons would undoubtedly have delivered memorable speeches.\\n\\nBiggest Upset by a Newcomer\\n\\nThe Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Limited Series category was packed with Oscar winners, including Kathy Bates, Cate Blanchett, Jodie Foster, and Lily Gladstone. However, it was Jessica Gunning in her first major role in Baby Reindeer who took the prize.\\n\\nBest Reason to Scream\\n\\nJamie Lee Curtis honors scream queens at the SAG Awards Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images\\n\\nThe ceremony took a moment to pay homage to Hollywood’s Scream Queens. In addition to a scream-filled montage, there were brief interviews with Scream stars Neve Campbell and Jenna Ortega, and Halloween’s Jamie Lee Curtis, who announced, “I’ve been screaming myself hoarse since the Carter administration.”\\n\\nGreatest Introduction\\n\\nWhile introducing the nominees for Male Actor in a Limited Series, Jamie Lee Curtis opened the card and quickly announced the winner as “the man who gave me COVID at the Golden Globes.” That would be Colin Farrell, who took the mic and immediately blamed actor Brendan Gleeson for giving him COVID in the first place.\\n\\nJust the Greatest, Period\\n\\nJane Fonda accepts the Life Achievement Award Michael Buckner/Variety via Getty Images\\n\\nJane Fonda has spent six decades acting in Hollywood and protesting in the streets and is a very deserving recipient of SAG’s Life Achievement Award. Fonda was introduced by Julia Louis-Dreyfus who had one question: “Who else could start a beauty revolution with her mug shot?” While Fonda has won many, many awards for her acting, including two Oscars, an Emmy, and seven Golden Globes, it was winding up on Richard Nixon’s enemies list that Louis-Dreyfus considers the real prize. At 87, Fonda dubbed herself a late bloomer, cracking, “I retired for 15 years and came back at 65, which is not usual. I made one of my most successful movies in my 80s and probably in my 90s, I’ll be doing my own stunts in an action movie.”\\n\\nShe explained that she grew up in the ’40s and ’50s when “women weren’t supposed to have opinions and get angry.” She loved the screen because “acting gave me a chance to play angry women with opinions, which, you know, is a bit of a stretch for me.” The longtime activist urged her fellow actors to fight back during these times with empathy. “What we, actors, create is empathy. Our job is to understand another human being so profoundly that we can touch their souls,” she said.\\n\\nRead more: Jane Fonda Champions Climate Action for Every Generation\\n\\nBest Flashback, Take One\\n\\nMariska Hargitay presents \"Law & Order: Guest Stars\" during the SAG Awards pic.twitter.com/5nevGJo7KE — the chris meloni project (@MeloniProject) February 24, 2025\\n\\nLongtime Law & Order star Mariska Hargitay swung by the award show to help highlight the series, which has become a seemingly mandatory stepping stone for young stars. That includes The Bear’s Liza Colón-Zayas, who played five different roles on the show (now that is acting) and Arrested Development star Tony Hale who didn’t even remember doing two separate turns on the set. Other actors who passed some time on Law & Order include Mahershala Ali, Pedro Pascal, Timothée Chalamet, Allison Janney, Adam Driver, Leighton Meester, and many more.\\n\\nBest French\\n\\nThe X-Files co-stars Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny teamed up to present the award for Outstanding Performance in an Ensemble. “‘Ensemble’, I believe that’s a French word for thank god, I only have to work three days a week,” explained Duchovny, before announcing that the award went to Only Murders in the Building.\\n\\nMost Honest Reaction\\n\\nRichard Kind, Selena Gomez, Michael Cyril Creighton, Molly Shannon accept Best Ensemble for Only Murders in the Building Michael Buckner/Variety via Getty Images\\n\\n“Wait we never win!” exclaimed Selena Gomez, the only star from the series who made it on stage to accept that award, explaining: “Marty and Steve aren’t here because they don’t really care.”\\n\\nGreatest Gossipers\\n\\nIn case you forgot, Kristen Bell voiced the titular Gossip Girl, but when it came to dishing out gossip about the folks at the SAG Awards, all she got was food talk. She complained to her source, Gossip Girl co-star Leighton Meester, that “The popes in Conclave were better at gossip than us”—Meester blamed it on just being really hungry—before introducing the cast of Conclave a.k.a. The next Gossip Girls.\\n\\nGreatest Verisimilitude\\n\\nJohn Lithgow, Ralph Fiennes, Sergio Castellitto, and Isabella Rossellini accept the Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture award for Conclave Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images\\n\\nThe cast of Conclave, a film about Cardinals choosing a new Pope, took a moment to pray for the health of Pope Francis, who remains in critical condition in the hospital. Later, the crew took home the final prize of the evening.\\n\\nRead more: Conclave Author Robert Harris on the Origin of His Best-Selling Vatican Thriller and Its Stunning Twist\\n\\nBiggest Union Booster\\n\\nZoe Saldaña continued her awards-season sweep by picking up the SAG Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the now embattled Netflix-distributed film, Emilia Pérez. She used her platform to give Jane Fonda a run for her money, politically speaking. “I am proud to be a part of a union that allows me to be who I am. I’ve never been questioned where I come from or judged for how I speak or what my pronouns are,” she said. “Everyone has the right to be who they are. Emilia Perez is about truth and love and us actors really have to tell stories that are thought-provoking and beautiful and live within the spectrum of artistic freedom.”\\n\\nRead more: How Emilia Pérez Became a Divisive Oscar Frontrunner\\n\\nRealest Reaction\\n\\nhow does it feel timmy nation pic.twitter.com/2C1I7WIfYy — lo (@timchals) February 24, 2025\\n\\nIn another somewhat surprising upset, Timothée Chalamet took the top acting prize for his work as Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown, triumphing over Golden Globe winner Adrien Brody. The young star shouted out his mother, who accompanied him to the award show and has “been working at Actors’ Equity for 30 years.” He then did the unthinkable: admitting that it was a really challenging part and confessing that he wanted to be one of the greats. “I know the classiest thing would be to downplay the effort that went into this role,” he said. “The truth is, this was five and a half years of my life. I poured everything I had into playing this incomparable artist.” He then added, “The truth is, I’m really in pursuit of greatness.”\\n\\nBest Flashback, Take Two\\n\\nDemi Moore at the 31st Screen Actors Guild Awards on Febr. 23, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. Michael Buckner/Variety via Getty Images\\n\\nDemi Moore continued her winning streak, taking the top acting prize for her work in The Substance. She took the chance to look back to when she got her SAG card when she was 15. “It changed my life because it gave me meaning, it gave me purpose, and it gave me direction because I was a kid on my own who had no blueprint for life,” she said. \"That little girl who didn\\'t believe in herself. I just... the words are kind of beyond me, so I’m going to have to just say \\'thank you.\\'\"\\n\\nBiggest Omen\\n\\nConclave took the night’s big prize for Ensemble in a Motion Picture. Could this be a sign of an upset at an increasingly cloudy Oscars Best Picture race?\\n\\nconclave best picture at the oscars i can feel it pic.twitter.com/V4kvRmDZZ8 — leah (@evenstqrs) February 24, 2025\\n\\nBiggest Shut-Outs\\n\\nBoth perennial awards favorite The Bear and Oscar Best Picture frontrunner Anora were shut out of the awards entirely.\\n\\nBest Sloth Shout-out\\n\\nOver the course of the awards show, Bell had little run-ins with some of her many, many past colleagues, who were all vying for the title of her favorite co-star. Of course, anyone who has seen the viral video of Bell losing her mind over a certain animal already knew who that title would go to in the end: the sloth. “That sloth is the closest thing I’ll ever have to a sex tape,” Bell said, before showing a photo of her one true love and closing out the evening.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'For months, the actor Karla Sofía Gascón had been reaping the rewards of leading a prestigious film. She plays the title character in Emilia Pérez, about a Mexican cartel boss who transitions into a woman and seeks to build a more virtuous life. The Spanish-language musical has faced waves of backlash since its release last year—but it has also found a devoted fan base among awards bodies.\\n\\nGascón was one of its anchors: She delivered an impassioned speech dedicated to the trans community at the Cannes Film Festival, where she shared the Best Actress prize with her castmates. When Emilia Pérez won the Golden Globe for Best Musical or Comedy last month, Gascón movingly addressed the audience. She made history shortly thereafter, becoming the first openly trans performer to earn an Oscar nomination. A relative unknown in the United States, the Spanish actor personified a message of tolerance and acceptance; Emilia Pérez, despite all of the criticism surrounding it, looked to have elevated a star who matched the heroism of Emilia Pérez herself.\\n\\nBut her momentum soon came to a halt. A journalist discovered an array of Gascón’s tweets dating back to 2016 that contained racist language and crude jokes about a range of marginalized communities. In response, the actor stopped following the typical awards-season playbook: She posted defensive updates on Instagram, sent a long-winded statement without the assistance of a public-relations team to The Hollywood Reporter, and personally scheduled a lengthy, tearful interview on CNN en Español. Gascón became Hollywood’s persona non grata, just under a month before the Academy Awards ceremony.\\n\\nRead: A film impossible to have mild feelings about\\n\\nThe actor’s trajectory represents one of the most dramatic implosions of an awards run in Oscars history. Twists and gaffes happening at the tail end of a race—for which this year’s voting round ended on Tuesday—are nothing new. (Gascón’s fellow Best Actress nominee Fernanda Torres weathered her own controversy this season; a clip of her wearing blackface in a comedy sketch resurfaced last month. The I’m Still Here star responded by releasing a measured apology.) But the nature of Gascón’s fall is unusual. Rarely has a nominee’s curated image—that of a righteous up-and-comer, applauded by an industry eager to demonstrate its tolerance—so thoroughly differed from the one conjured by her personal online accounts. Her case is a fascinating look at how industry status can collide with the social-media era: In spite of the awards season’s purported aims to celebrate cinema, a performer’s off-screen narrative can matter just as much as their work.\\n\\nGascón’s diminished chances of winning a trophy arguably resulted not so much from the resurfacing of her bigoted tweets, but mainly from the way she diverged from established public-relations guidelines. Oscar campaigns tend to be carefully controlled endeavors, and Netflix, Emilia Pérez’s distributor in the United States, has one of the most experienced awards-strategy teams in Hollywood. The streamer had helped turn Gascón from an unknown in the U.S. into a contender—and on the same day that her old posts garnered attention, Netflix circulated her official apology. “As someone in a marginalized community,” read the standard-issue statement, “I know this suffering all too well and I am deeply sorry to those I have caused pain.”\\n\\nBut soon afterward—and reportedly without clearing her plans with Netflix—Gascón went rogue. She sent The Hollywood Reporter an additional statement claiming that her tweets were misunderstood, at times even by herself. (“Sometimes I, myself, am not even aware of having written something negative,” she wrote.) She shared thoughts on Instagram about her words being taken out of context. And she scheduled the CNN en Español interview, during which she argued that she’d done nothing wrong. She also claimed that her co-stars—including Zoe Saldaña, the Supporting Actress Oscar front-runner—supported her “200 percent,” despite no public evidence that they shared her sentiments. “I have not committed any crime, nor have I harmed anyone,” she said. “I am not a racist, nor am I anything that all these people have taken it upon themselves to try to make others believe I am.”\\n\\nThe more Gascón tried to salvage her reputation by herself, the more those associated with the film pulled away from her. Shortly after Emilia Pérez nabbed 13 Oscar nominations—the most of any movie this year—Netflix began removing billboards in Los Angeles that singled her out; the company has reportedly restricted her access to the team’s travel funds, making it harder for her to attend more precursor award ceremonies. Gascón responded to comments from the film’s director, Jacques Audiard, about her “self-destructive approach” by pledging on Instagram to stay silent going forward. Earlier this month, Netflix’s chief content officer, Bela Bajaria, addressed the scandal, calling the controversy “a bummer.” (The company is also “reevaluating” its strategy for vetting actors’ social-media accounts, she said.)\\n\\nRead: The Oscars have left the mainstream moviegoer behind\\n\\nGascón’s attempt to control her image is singular in its audacity. None of her fellow awards contenders this season has made such bold, unfiltered moves while trying to convince Academy voters that they’re worthy of a trophy. Even before her tweets resurfaced, the Emilia Pérez star had begun deviating from the film’s standard promotional press campaign by chiding Torres’s social-media strategy. Criticizing another nominee’s tactics is an inadvisable step for someone on the Oscar track; the act can come off as combative, and the Academy can penalize attacks against fellow contenders. “There are people working with Fernanda Torres tearing me and Emilia Pérez down,” she claimed in an interview. “That speaks more about their movie than mine.” Gascón later retracted the remarks and explained that she wasn’t targeting her competitor, but merely trying to admonish “toxicity and violent hate speech on social media.” And then, when her past social-media posts came up, she completely ignored the rules of how to face a blowback. She could have followed in Torres’s footsteps—the I’m Still Here actor had just demonstrated how effective sticking with a standard mea culpa can be—yet once again, Gascón diverged from the norm.\\n\\nNot everyone follows the Oscars playbook, of course. But the other most unconventional campaign this year is notable because it’s so thoroughly unlike what Gascón is doing. Timothée Chalamet, who’s up for his performance as Bob Dylan in the musical biopic A Complete Unknown, certainly seems to be defying the rules of typical press tours, surprising his look-alikes at a contest in New York City and riding a Lime bike onto the red carpet at a premiere, among other antics. Chalamet’s efforts have worked in part because he is an established, controversy-free celebrity, a household name with movie-star appeal. If anything, his well-received run so far, even if he doesn’t win the Oscar, underlines what made Gascón’s Hail Mary fail: Chalamet’s calculated, personality-driven stunts evoke the youthful renegade appeal of the cultural icon he played, courting chatter but not criticism.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Gascón’s defensive behavior, by turns rebellious and inflammatory, undid the storyline she and Netflix had cultivated for months: that the actor intimately understood why Emilia Pérez succeeded with so many awards-season voters, many of whom are Gascón’s peers. Gascón’s character in the film is supposed to epitomize the human capacity for good, and for overcoming flaws with grace. After the actor’s tweets resurfaced, she emphasized that “light will always triumph over darkness” in her Netflix-approved apology; the statement repositioned Gascón as remorseful about her past, just like Emilia had been. But if Gascón appeared to exemplify the film’s message early in its journey toward Oscar glory, she has come to embody a different narrative—that of a shocking, largely self-inflicted public collapse. It’s not the kind that tends to win someone an Oscar.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'joined the Vox video team as a video producer in 2021. His coverage focuses on all things cinema, from the intricacies of film history to the nuts and bolts of filmmaking.\\n\\nIn 2025, Tom Hanks is 67 years old. Yet, in his latest film Here (directed by Robert Zemeckis), he’s convincingly transformed to appear as young as 18, and aged even beyond his current years. And the effect actually looks … good!\\n\\nBut de-aging effects haven’t always looked this good. Attempts at de-aging can be seen as early as 2006 — and since then filmmakers have experimented with tools and had … varying degrees of success. While 2D blurring and enhancement was the first iteration, realistic de-aging in motion required 3D methods — but no matter which way you sliced it, the process remained labor-intensive and results were often somewhere between okay and the uncanny valley.\\n\\nHere’s VFX supervisor Kevin Baillie told me that the current versions of these tools weren’t going to work on the movie. There were too many shots, and the results were too inconsistent for the quality level they were striving toward. So the filmmaking team looked elsewhere, to the bleeding edge of AI tools, to see what was possible. By feeding it a wealth of images featuring Tom Hanks and co-stars Robin Wright, Paul Bettany, and Kelly Reilly, they found they could create images that were remarkably realistic, streamlining the once arduous process.\\n\\nBut the true game changer was optimizing the speed of this tool to enable a real-time feed on set. This empowered actors, costume designers, makeup artists, hairstylists, and other crew members to ensure that every version of the characters, at any age, felt authentic and believable.\\n\\nIf you want to learn more about how all this was pulled off, check out Vox Video’s latest!'},\n",

       "   'content': '“Thirty years ago, I had a producer tell me that I was a ‘popcorn actress,’ ” Demi Moore said in her Jan. 5 speech accepting a Best Actress Golden Globe for playing over-the-hill aerobics star Elisabeth Sparkle in Coralie Fargeat’s body-horror epic The Substance. “I made that mean that this wasn’t something I was allowed to have. That I could do movies that were successful, that made a lot of money, but that I couldn’t be acknowledged.”\\n\\nRarely has an actress gotten so much mileage out of an early acceptance speech. Even though it’s been weeks since she won that Globe; even though The Substance is quite the tough hang, reportedly putting off some academy voters; even though Anora has gathered new momentum for Best Picture and its star Mikey Madison won a surprise Best Actress BAFTA last weekend—despite all of this, Demi Moore is still considered a pretty sure thing to triumph on Oscar night. As of late this week, the betting website Polymarket had Moore with a higher chance of winning than all the other nominees in the category combined, and the lion’s share of the prognosticators on Gold Derby have picked Moore to take home the trophy. All winter, everyone from Vulture to the New York Times has pronounced her to be the front-runner, with both outlets citing “her masterful Globes acceptance speech, an A-plus bit of awards campaigning” that cemented the fact that she has the best “narrative” of any Best Actress contender.\\n\\nThere’s just one problem with this: Demi Moore should not win a Best Actress Oscar for The Substance! After first seeing this movie in the theater, I was so overwhelmed by the volume of latex, fake blood, and barfed-up boobs, and so confused trying to puzzle through the story’s internal logic and parse its over-the-top third act, that I didn’t really register Moore’s performance at all. Watching the movie again, better prepared for Fargeat’s bombast, I realized that Slate’s Dana Stevens was (as per usual) correct in her early pan: The Substance is a mess, full of sound and fury, signifying little, with Moore given scant else to do besides “react with horror to her latest mutation.” Indeed, Moore is, well, just fine in it. If you were to strip away all the prosthetics—and all the extratextual weight we bring to seeing this real-life sex symbol grapple with the fact of her own aging—I don’t believe there would be all that much left underneath.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nYes, Moore has one moving scene, which happens to make for a perfect Oscar clip: She misses out on a date with an old high school classmate because she can’t bring herself to believe she looks good enough to leave the house, and gazes into the mirror, rubbing her makeup off again and again, with escalating rage and frustration. But she mostly does a lot of gasping, gurgling, and griping from inside piles of the movie’s prodigious (and genuinely Oscar-worthy!) hair and makeup. That’s what this movie, being the opposite of subtle, needed from its lead actress, but it’s not clear to me that the actress needed to be Demi Moore, rather than any other sex symbol over the age of 50. Can you imagine it being a lesser performance if it were Sharon Stone? Kim Basinger? Julia Roberts?! Meanwhile, Margaret Qualley, who plays Sue, the younger version of Elisabeth Sparkle, got no Oscar nomination, despite having her own share of Grand Guignol “My teeth fell out right before I had to go onstage!” moments, moments in which she’s arguably more persuasive. (The actor inside the suit to play “Monstro Elisasue”? That’s Qualley.) Not to be on Sue’s side, because she’s already got youth and beauty going for her, but why?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDemi Moore’s performance in The Substance isn’t even the most courageous, most convincing, or most nuanced performance that we got this year from a 1990s sex symbol playing a middle-aged woman struggling to come to terms with her own age. Even setting aside Pamela Anderson’s comeback role in The Last Showgirl, which earned her nominations from the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards but left her empty-handed on Oscar-nominations day, 2024 also gave us Nicole Kidman in Babygirl, delivering a turn that had quite a bit of its own awards momentum before Moore upstaged it from the Globes podium.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdmittedly, much of the difference between Kidman’s performance in Babygirl and Moore’s in The Substance has to do with the movies that they’re in, with Babygirl having the sense to step back and give the space for its lead to do her thing. Babygirl may have no spinal births or weird yellow fluids flowing through tubing, but it still has plenty to say about being in an older female body, and rather than smothering Kidman in makeup and extreme close-ups, it lets her performance speak loud and clear. Babygirl is about sex: A married CEO has the life-changing revelation that she wants to be a sub to someone’s dom, and has to handle the fact that the guy she figured that out with is her intern. But much of the pathos of the situation arises from Kidman’s character coming to understand what her body wants so late in her body’s life, and Kidman’s face shows us every emotion, making it all believable, even when she’s doing something as silly as crawling across the floor to lap milk from a saucer.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSome of the trappings are similar. Director Halina Reijn’s camera gently, but mercilessly, shows the contrast between 57-year-old Nicole Kidman’s artificially tightened and filled-up face and her normal fiftysomething hands, just as Moore lets Fargeat pull right into the big pores on her face. And if we’re judging bravery based on which elder actress showed her butt, I will admit that they both did this. (Also, let’s be real: They both look amazing! Moore looks so amazing at 62 that they aged her character down 12 years, to 50. More damning than any Hollywood satire in The Substance is the fact that Moore is considered brave for playing 12 years younger than she actually is.) But aside from that one makeup scene, The Substance leaves little room for the subtleties of feeling that Kidman conveys in flickers of shame and delight and excitement and defiance in every scene.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI know. It’s not very Oscars-savvy of me to presume that it’s the performance that should make the Oscar. It’s Moore’s story, which she presented in capsule version on the Golden Globes stage, and which she recently told in a well-received 2019 memoir written with journalist Ariel Levy, that’s moving people here. Coming out of a tough childhood, Moore became an actress as a teenager, a Brat Pack icon as a twentysomething, and a big-earning box-office star in her late 20s and 30s, putting up a string of hits (Ghost in 1990, A Few Good Men in 1992, Indecent Proposal in 1993, Disclosure in 1994). Then there was her marriage to Bruce Willis, her wilderness period, doing TV and being part of ensemble casts, her marriage to much-younger actor Ashton Kutcher, and her drug-use issues over the years.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe redemption arc an Oscar for her would offer is pretty unparalleled, at least among this awards season’s contenders. Kidman has also done her share of “popcorn acting,” but has worked too much lately, and gotten too many awards in the past, which I’m told makes for a bad narrative. Fernanda Torres, 59 years old, who’s nominated for I’m Still Here, is only the second Brazilian nominee for an acting Oscar; the first, back in 1999, was her own mother, Fernanda Montenegro, who also appears in the movie, playing Torres’ older self. But Torres, despite herself having a long, illustrious career (she’s been described as “the Nicole Kidman of Brazil”) with no academy recognition, has this little problem where she’s unfamiliar, not American. Bad narrative!\\n\\nAnd yes, Moore’s history is pretty intense, and we love to see an older person suddenly find themself on the verge of achieving a long-desired goal. But when you take a closer look at the moral of this story, it kind of falls apart. Quoting an unnamed “woman” in her Globes speech, Moore said that one message of The Substance is: “Just know, you will never be enough. But you can know the value of your worth if you just put down the measuring stick.” But wait! Isn’t the Oscar Hollywood’s most famous measuring stick? And it’s not as if Moore has never gotten any reward for her work: Besides the multiple People’s Choice awards, Moore became, in the mid-1990s, the highest-paid actress in the world.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhich is not even to mention the worthiness of Moore’s competitors for this award. As Wicked’s green-skinned and purportedly monstrous Elphaba, Cynthia Erivo delivers all the self-loathing that Moore does, except (to paraphrase the old line about Ginger Rogers) backwards, in bejeweled slippers, and while belting out songs in her three-octave range atop a broom. And Moore’s closest rival is Anora’s Mikey Madison, who, in one career-making performance, proves she could be a popcorn star and just about anything she wants, conveying the title character’s stormy emotional arc, from hope to angry desperation to alienation to sadness, all in a pitch-perfect Brooklyn accent with a side of Russian. (Emilia Pérez’s Karla Sofía Gascón, meanwhile, is a whole other story.)\\n\\nPeople in the industry seem to enjoy feeling as if Hollywood is more politically aware and savvy than it was when Moore was at her most powerful, when she was (as she’s said) “extremely shamed” for her huge paycheck for doing Striptease, and the academy can prove this by voting for Moore’s performance in this particular movie—supposedly showing itself to finally be on the right side of history. The academy might like how much Moore wants it, and be flattered by her excitement. And maybe it’s nice, if you’re an older academy voter, to believe that you, too, could still have a chance to do the things you longed to do when you were in your prime. “The universe told me that ‘you’re not done,’ ” Moore said in her speech, describing how she felt when the script for The Substance came to her. Looking at Moore’s year, you could make yourself believe that the same could be true for you. She’ll probably win! We’ll know more after the SAG Awards this weekend. But she shouldn’t.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Parker Posey has a story she likes to tell. In interviews for over a decade now, the actress has been recounting a conversation with her agent in which she would ask why she kept missing out on roles in major Hollywood productions—say, playing “Matt’s Damon’s ex-wife in two or three scenes of an action movie,” she quipped by way of example to Vogue in 2023. “Finally, I asked my agent again, ‘Just tell me what’s going on. What is the feedback? I don’t quite understand,’ ” Posey had told the New Yorker a year prior. “Then they go, ‘Well, the studio says you’re too much of an indie queen.’ ”\\n\\nHeavy lies the head that wears the indie crown, evidently.\\n\\nYet perhaps Posey’s reign may finally be coming to an end. The latest season of The White Lotus, HBO’s megahit mystery satirizing the lives of the well-to-do, is likely to be among the most mainstream and widely watched productions Posey has ever been part of. In it, she plays Victoria Ratliff, a pill-popping matriarch with a broad North Carolina drawl who is vacationing with her family at a luxury wellness retreat in Thailand. As her lorazepam runs dry, and the rug is slowly pulled out from beneath the Ratliffs for reasons entirely of their own doing, Victoria is forced to finally contend with a harsh reality bearing down on her like a tsunami.\\n\\nRelated From Slate The Problem With The White Lotus Read More\\n\\nIt’s only natural that critics and viewers are positioning Posey’s spoiled, over-the-top character as the natural heir to Jennifer Coolidge’s Tanya McQuoid, the self-centered fan favorite who appeared in the show’s first two seasons before (spoiler) meeting her end in the waters off Sicily. Just like Coolidge, Posey relies on her extensive background in comedy to deliver all the show’s best and campiest lines, like when Victoria questions the company she’ll have to share on board a luxury yacht by asking, “Are they decent people? Just because people are rich doesn’t mean they’re not trashy.” Or when she defends her queries into the behavior of local Buddhist monks by stating, “Look at the Catholics! Organized religion and deviant sexual behavior go hand in hand.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAs Coolidge basks in a career renaissance thanks to her two-time-Emmy-winning work in The White Lotus, all eyes are now on Posey, who was coincidentally Coolidge’s comedienne co-star in the Christopher Guest mockumentaries Best in Show (2000) and For Your Consideration (2006). Might this role finally earn Posey the plaudits, awards, and career stability she too has long deserved?\\n\\nPractically every story written about Posey appears to be legally required to refer to her as “Queen of the Indies,” a moniker first bestowed in 1997 by Richard Corliss in Time magazine. By that year, she’d already appeared in a dozen indie films like Dazed and Confused (1993), Clockwatchers (1997), and Party Girl (1995), which was her first leading role. For The House of Yes (1997), in which she played a mentally troubled woman obsessed with Jackie Kennedy and her own brother, she even won a special award at Sundance, a festival with which she would eventually become nearly synonymous. Yet mainstream fame and success still eluded her. She’d lost out on major parts to Sandra Bullock (1994’s Speed), Janeane Garofalo (1994’s Reality Bites), and Renée Zellweger (1996’s Jerry Maguire). (Such ignominy followed decades later when she was replaced with Marisa Tomei in the play The Realistic Joneses just when it transferred to Broadway in 2014.) “How can someone who has It—the looks, the presence, the acting chops—not have it all? Because the major studios have yet to fall in love with her,” Corliss wrote in Time. “She is too indie for the majors, too pert to get the serioso parts that win critics’ awards.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAside from her lead work in little-seen indie films like Broken English (2007) and Price Check (2012), Posey has built a career largely playing supporting roles (sometimes villainous, sometimes ditzy, but often beloved by fans) in movies like You’ve Got Mail (1998), Scream 3 (2000), Josie and the Pussycats (2001), Blade: Trinity (2004), and Superman Returns (2006). On television, she’s had recurring guest spots on shows like Will & Grace, Boston Legal, The Good Wife, and Search Party, but her biggest project, Netflix’s Lost in Space reboot, had little cultural impact and was not renewed after three seasons. She bears the unfortunate stain of working with two prominent Hollywood men shortly before they were blacklisted in the industry—Woody Allen (2015’s Irrational Man and 2016’s Café Society) and Louis C.K. (a four-episode turn playing his girlfriend on Louie in 2012)—and has openly bristled when asked about them. In 2015, she also appeared in eight episodes of a show I’ve never heard of, Granite Flats, which was created for a network I’ve never heard of, BYUtv, which is owned and operated by Brigham Young University. (“I’m not saying ‘no’ to anything if it comes along and is gonna pay me and keep me working!’” she joked in 2012.)\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThroughout her career, Posey has been refreshingly honest with the press about just how tough she’s found working in entertainment, wondering openly whether she had been forgotten about or if she even had a place in the industry. Perhaps her most astute assessment of her career was one she gave to the New York Times in 2015: “Hollywood just doesn’t know what to do with me,” she said. “And it’s not for lack of trying.”\\n\\nOne reason Posey has bewildered the industry is obvious, if depressing. Although she is undeniably beautiful, she doesn’t necessarily look like Hollywood’s traditional idea of a leading lady. With her pale skin, sharp features, large mouth, and dark-brown hair, she’s always felt more New York than L.A. (Indeed, she’s lived in Manhattan almost consistently since the 1990s.) She’s too boho, too artsy, too weird to fit within the conventional heroine mold.\\n\\nBut, more importantly, her beauty also belies what kind of performer she is: a character actor. Posey is just so good at playing characters that are much, much bigger than her birdlike frame. It’s not that she’s been pigeonholed into playing one specific archetype, like a villain or best friend, but that she’s at her best when playing a certain type of person. They’re quirky. They’re loud. They demand your attention. And they seem as if only the larger-than-life Posey could ever have played them. “I’m always happy when I can fit into something that it seems like only I can fit into,” she told Variety in 2022.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn You’ve Got Mail, for example, Posey’s supporting turn as Tom Hanks’ self-absorbed book-editor girlfriend who “makes coffee nervous” was originally positioned as a villain, but later reassessments were more generous to the character. Decider’s Meghan O’Keefe declared her the film’s most misunderstood character and one whose life feels so much bigger than the scope of the movie, largely due to Posey’s zany aggression. “Posey fills each moment up with a tornado of personality,” O’Keefe wrote.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nPosey’s actor character, Jennifer Jolie, is also the standout in the highly meta Scream 3 thanks to her perfect balance of comedy and terror. Picture the fear in her eyes when she whispers to Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) that she, and by extension Jolie (who is playing Weathers in a movie), is likely to be the killer’s next victim—before jumping into the arms of her bodyguard in an homage to the 1992 Kevin Costner/Whitney Houston film. “These memorable lines only land because of Posey’s exaggerated delivery,” Gaby Shedwick wrote in a revisitation of the character for Collider last year. “Posey is purposefully over-the-top. She is the constant reminder in Scream 3 that the franchise does not take itself too seriously.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOf course, chief among this repertoire of classic Posey characters are those she played in the mockumentaries by Christopher Guest. His comedies encourage the kind of deranged improvisation that brings out his actors’ most outlandish performances, like Posey’s turns as the peppy Dairy Queen employee turned community theater actor in Waiting for Guffman (1996) or the braces-wearing and highly strung yuppie owner of a Weimaraner in Best in Show. Guest encourages Posey and his other troupe members to act for the people at the back of the movie theater, yet they’re never overacting—they’re just playing big characters. In her memoir, Posey declared that the best compliment she ever received on her work was when a man in a Lowe’s parking lot pointed her out to his 5-year-old son as the “crazy dog lady” from Best in Show, sending the boy into a fit of laughter. “Nothing makes me happier than a 5-year-old boy laughing at a grown woman acting like a 5-year-old,” she wrote.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBut not only are such roles few and far between, the small-to-mid-budget movies in which they tend to appear have themselves become rarer in today’s Hollywood. The need for true character actors like Posey has diminished. While some actors known for eccentric roles in indie fare have successfully made the jump to mainstream stardom (Posey has quite rightly identified Toni Collette as an actor with whom she shares a lot of career DNA, but the Australian has done better in playing straighter, more serious characters), other character actors who had been floundering in Hollywood eventually gravitated to television roles that finally thrust them onto the A-list. This group includes Coolidge, of course, but also Catherine O’Hara, who most recently leveraged her Emmy-winning work on Schitt’s Creek into a Super Bowl commercial. It’s no coincidence that these three women have all been so celebrated for the work they’ve done together in the Christopher Guest Cinematic Universe, where they perfected the art of painting big characters with broad strokes. (It’s probably a safe bet that O’Hara will eventually appear in a season of The White Lotus.)\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nRelated From Slate The White Lotus Season 2 Left Us With a Bigger Mystery Than the One It Started With Read More\\n\\nIf The White Lotus creator Mike White does for Posey what he did for Coolidge, then the universe will have restored to it some measure of karma (a key theme itself for this season of the show). But the truth is that things had already started to pick up in recent years for Posey. She played her first biographical character, prosecutor Freda Black, in a scene-stealing role in the HBO Max miniseries The Staircase (2022), and turned in another performance that was small but quite literally killer in Ari Aster’s Beau Is Afraid (2023). Last year, she even earned the first Emmy nomination in her three-decade career for her murderous guest spot in Amazon’s reboot of Mr. & Mrs. Smith.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn The White Lotus, Posey’s penchant for chewing the scenery is again on full, delicious display, even during the moments when her character Victoria is suffering from extensive jet lag. Her accent—which actually isn’t too far from Posey’s native Louisiana and Mississippi roots—is the biggest on the show, and hearing Posey’s sprawling vowel sounds feels somehow even wilder than listening to British actor Jason Isaacs, who plays her husband, do the same. Her mouth is perpetually twisted into an exaggerated frown shape, as if the Thai humidity were weighing on it. She self-medicates, she says, because of anxiety—a trait that’s on full display whenever she’s forced to interact with anyone outside her family unit. Among them, she can be both catty and blithely ignorant, but also blunt, like when she goes toe-to-toe with one of her children because of life decisions they are making. Perhaps her biggest moment of realization in the six screener episodes I’ve seen so far is one shown in the show’s trailer, when Victoria, wearing a silk kaftan and rubbing lotion into her hands, decides she’d rather be dead than poor. “I just don’t have it in me,” she muses. “I don’t think I ever did.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn the limited glimpses audiences have had so far of this season, Posey’s portrayal has already proven divisive. For every person adamant she deserved an Emmy the moment she uttered her first line (“We flew over the North Pole!”), there is another who believes her accent is too extravagant, her portrayal is too comical, that she’s doing too much. And while I will say that Posey’s character, like all of them on the series, gets to show more range as the season progresses, what’s undeniable is that Posey is doing what she does best: absolutely going for it.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIf Posey does finally find herself standing on stage at the Emmys for The White Lotus, she would do well to remember advice she once shared. In 2012, she appeared in a pretaped bit at the awards show portraying an acting teacher running a class on how to deliver an acceptance speech. If the sketch’s central gag rested on the idea that Posey ever having to give such a speech was fanciful, she never seemed to care. In the three-minute scene, Posey is as committed to the crazed character as if it were Lady Macbeth. Naturally, you can’t take your eyes off her. “Look at you! Prove them wrong!” she shouts to her students. “Hold it like you own it, like you’ve already owned it.”'}],\n",

       "   'time': '2024-09-11T11:00:25',\n",
       "   'content': 'British comedian Jamali Maddix is well known around these parts for his acclaimed VICELAND show on zealots, racists, and other angry people, Hate Thy Neighbor. Lately, Jamali’s been back on the extremist beat, hanging out with pedophile hunters and a gun cult led by a man named ‘King Bullethead’ for a new TV docuseries.\\n\\nWe called him up to get a read on Follow The Leader, set to air from September 17th in the UK.\\n\\nVideos by VICE\\n\\nVICE: Hey Jamali. Obviously this beat is a familiar one for you. But how have extreme ways of thinking, cults, etc. all developed and changed in recent years?\\n\\nJamali Maddix: I think the internet changed everything when it comes to those communities. If there was a small group in a small town in America, it stayed within that small town in America. But things spread more now, so you’ve got movements or ideas that can spread easily. And the cost of making content has dropped dramatically. So you’ve got men and women making their content, of whatever their ideas are, at a high quality—and they can push it out on the biggest channel in the world, which is the internet, you know? So I think these ideas are more easily accessible than ever.\\n\\nYeah, it’s also interesting how everyone’s nan now seems to have quite a fringe view of the world.\\n\\nWhen it comes to certain views—maybe political or low-end conspiratorial views—it’s also because there’s so much information. I think it’s difficult for certain generations to decipher what is and isn’t real, because there’s a generation of people who grew up when newspapers were just… I mean, obviously, there’s always been lies in newspapers, but journalists investigated a story and then they presented the story, maybe with a twinge of political bias, but they presented pretty much the story—and now it’s just, “I can make a website and say whatever I want,” and it’s considered fact. So I don’t think everyone’s got a ‘fringe’ view. It’s just some people can’t decipher between what is the real and the fake thing on the internet.\\n\\nAI images are going to change things a lot as well, because they will actually trick people’s eyes into thinking real images—things that have never happened—actually happened. It’s gonna be a weird future.\\n\\nWhat role has COVID played in all this?\\n\\nI think people during COVID had a lot of time to think. It’s not my line, but a comedian once said to me: “Some people have too much time to think, and they have arguments with themselves that they always win.” I think people had so much time on their hands, and they reflected on their life and made more brash decisions.\\n\\nIn terms of the new series, Rod of Iron [a militant pro-gun offshoot of the Moonies religious movement, led by brothers Yung Jin Moon and Kook-jin Moon] used a lot of people’s apprehension [of the vaccine] to draw more people towards their ideas.\\n\\nJamali shares a moment wtih an interviewee in ‘follow the leader’ (credit: uktv)\\n\\nSo what’s some of the exciting new stuff that you unearthed while shooting this series?\\n\\nI enjoyed doing the predator hunter one; I enjoyed doing the passport bro one. I don’t know what mad things I uncovered. I don’t think there was like a mad…\\n\\nPredator hunter as in like…?\\n\\nIt’s people who they’ve alleged to have spoken to underaged children, and then they go and confront them.\\n\\nI think there’s something a bit off about that.\\n\\nYeah. In the film, it’s that complication. That’s what the film’s about, is the complicated nature of it, because we all agree that’s a bad crime, but it’s like, should they be… you know what I mean? All those questions get thrown up, and there isn’t really a definitive answer to it. That’s how I wanted to make it. I wanted it to be as if the audience member decides for themselves, where their morality lies within it, you know?\\n\\nHas anything in your films made you feel like “we’re fucked”?\\n\\nI felt that going in.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nI think that’s just apparent with the state of the world. I don’t think my docs are going to be the change of that; I’m not the canary in the coal mine. Human beings, we just adjust. If you would have said pre-COVID, there’ll be a time when you can’t go out for two years. You would have gone, “Nah, fucking I’ll go mad.” But you did it. You know what I mean? If you went to prison in fucking, the world’s worst prison, the first few days [would be tough], but after a couple months, you’d adjust. That’s just how human beings are. We just adjust, or we don’t and we don’t survive. And I think human beings just survive. So I think wherever the world goes, whether it’s the internet or whether it’s this, we just adjust, or we don’t. That’s the two options we have. The films are just exploring what’s going on and the people behind it.\\n\\nJamali Maddix: Follow The Leader airs on U&Dave at 10PM each Tuesday from 17th September, with the box-set available to stream free on U from Tuesday 17th September.\\n\\nFollow Nick Thompson on X at @niche_t_'},\n",

       "   'title': 'Percival Everett Is Challenging the American Literary Canon',\n",
       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': \"Percival Everett claims he is not as brilliant as his fans know him to be. He deeply researches the worlds in which his novels are set, yet swears that everything he learns falls out of his head as soon as each book is published. “So I’m no smarter at the end than I was at the beginning,” he says, shrugging his shoulders. Years ago, sick of his writing students asking him if they were good enough to be published, he took a class to a bookstore in Middlebury, Vt., to prove he was not unique. “Look around,” he told them. “Anyone can be published. ‘Are you good enough to make a difference?’ is the question.”\\n\\nWith his latest, James, a reimagining of Huckleberry Finn told from the perspective of the escaped slave Jim—who drops his nickname for the more noble-sounding James—Everett has jump-started a conversation about the great American novel, how issues of race interplay with the so-called American canon, and how we talk to our children about America’s past. But just a few hours before he wins the National Book Award for fiction, he demurs when pressed on the book’s impact. “If a reader is coming to me for any kind of message or answer about anything in the world,” he says, “they’re already in deep trouble.”\\n\\nFor many, however, James has become an important companion piece to Mark Twain’s work, the book “all American literature comes from,” to quote Ernest Hemingway. “I’ve been getting lots of mail from former and current English teachers thanking me that they can now teach Huck Finn again because they can do it alongside James,” he admits, “which is great news for me and certainly flattering, but doesn’t come as a great surprise. It’s a problematic text.”\\n\\nEverett, 68, would do away with the canon altogether if he could. But at the very least he hopes that writers, readers, and educators can acknowledge the inherent issues with putting certain books on a pedestal. “My joke is, ‘The canon is loaded,’” says Everett. “Canon formation is necessarily skewed. It’s necessarily racist and sexist. As soon as you’re saying there are these texts that must be read, someone has to choose. Who chooses?”\\n\\nWhile Jim is little more than a sidekick on Huck’s journey down the Mississippi in the original, in Everett’s version he is at the center of the story. James and other Black characters code switch when white characters are present; on his own, James interrogates philosophers like Voltaire for his repugnant views on slavery. “Enslaved people, it had occurred to me, are always depicted as simple-minded and superstitious, and of course, they weren’t,” Everett says. “So I embarked on this.”\\n\\nEverett gives James the gift of language, and James writes his account of his travels with a stolen pencil stub—one which comes at great human cost. “Whoever controls language, controls everything. If someone has no voice, they cannot get what they want or what they need,” says Everett.\\n\\nEverett, who has published two dozen novels, including the Pulitzer Prize finalist Telephone, has historically bristled at being categorized in the genre of African American fiction, especially considering he has written everything from propulsive westerns to a novella styled like a Lifetime movie. “Any work of art that comes out of this American culture is about race. If there is no race in it, that is a statement about race,” he says.\\n\\nThis frustration is at the heart of Erasure, one of Everett’s early and best-known novels, which was adapted into the Oscar-winning 2023 film American Fiction. The story centers on Thelonious “Monk” Ellison, the author of experimental novels that don’t sell particularly well. Monk becomes so exasperated with the publishing industry bolstering Black fiction that depicts only stereotypes that he pens a novel as an illiterate thug to prove a point. The book is a hit, much to the author’s chagrin. James, too, will get the Hollywood treatment, with Steven Spielberg producing and Taika Waititi in talks to direct, though Everett insists this attention is “fleeting.” “I'll write some experimental novel next that no one will understand,” he says. “You would have to be crazy to get into literary fiction to get famous or to get rich.”\"},\n",

       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': 'How \"Beyond The Gates\" ushers in a new era for daytime drama\\n\\nNot long ago, soap operas ruled daytime TV. The casts of shows like \"General Hospital,\" \"All My Children\" and \"Days of Our Lives\" became part of daily life in the United States.\\n\\nFor the first time in more than 25 years, a new daytime soap opera will debut and it is already making history.\\n\\n\"Beyond the Gates\" focuses on the Dupree family, a prominent Black family living in a gated community outside Washington, D.C. Leading the cast are actors Clifton Davis and Tamara Tunie with Daphnée Duplaix and Karla Mosley portraying their daughters.\\n\\n\"It\\'s fresh, it\\'s innovative, it\\'s exciting,\" Duplaix said during production in December.\\n\\n\"This is 2025,\" added Tunie. \"The writers came out swinging. The first episode is just like \\'Pfooom!\\'\"\\n\\nThose writers are making their own history with the show.\\n\\n\"It appears to be that we\\'re the first Black female executive producers in all of daytime drama,\" said Sheila Ducksworth, an executive producer and president of this CBS/NAACP production.\\n\\nDucksworth partnered with Michele Val Jean, who serves as executive producer, head writer and showrunner.\\n\\n\"I\\'d say it\\'s been a couple of decades in the making that I\\'ve wanted to actually produce and make a soap opera,\" Ducksworth said. \"But what I felt was missing was one that centered on the Black experience.\"\\n\\nVal Jean shared a similar vision: \"I just wanted to see people that looked like me. I didn\\'t want downtrodden Black people. I wanted rich, messy Black people that carry the stories.\"\\n\\nThat inclusive approach extends behind the camera.\\n\\n\"I look around, and I see African American cameramen. I see the costumers, and lighting, and crew,\" Davis said.\\n\\n\"The writers, the makeup, the hair,\" Duplaix added.\\n\\nDuring a December filming, a crew of more than 200 people worked around the clock to bring the show to life. Hair designer Wankaya Hinkson emphasized the importance of representation in the production.\\n\\n\"Bringing the culture to daytime television was very important to me,\" Hinkson said. \"I want everyone to be able to identify themselves on daytime television.\"\\n\\nHistorically, hair and makeup departments often lacked people who knew how to work with actors of color, but \"Beyond the Gates\" has prioritized expertise in this area.\\n\\n\"We wear our hair many, many different ways,\" Hinkson explained. \"It\\'s a part of our Black girl magic. I wanted to make sure that I had different textures.\"\\n\\nThe creators, cast and crew aim to deliver the dramatic storytelling that soap operas are known for while making content that resonates with everyone.\\n\\nWhen asked how she hopes audiences will react, Tunie said, \"I hope they fall in love. I hope they fall head over heels in love with everybody in the show, with all of the perfection, flaws, humanness, and all of it.\"'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-24T16:45:02',\n",
       "   'content': \"This article mentions allegations of sexual assault and rape.\\n\\nLast week, Usher sat down with Keke Palmer for a candid chat on her podcast. The pair discussed everything from their viral moment at his 2023 Las Vegas residency to his new Audible special, “The Last Showman” — but now, one particular clip about Usher’s “first kiss” is gaining traction online.\\n\\nDenise Truscello / Getty Images for Live Nation\\n\\nFor some quick but necessary context, Usher was just a teenager when he shot to fame following the release of his self-titled debut album in 1994. When he was 13, he spent a year living at Sean “Diddy” Combs’s house, in what he called “Puffy Flavor Camp.”\\n\\nKmazur / WireImage\\n\\nAs you’re likely aware, Diddy was charged with sex trafficking, racketeering, and transportation to engage in prostitution last year. He has been accused of rape, sexual misconduct, and extortion dating back to the 1990s across more than 30 civil cases. He has denied all of these allegations.\\n\\nIn 2016, Usher recalled seeing some “wild” and “curious” things while living with Diddy as a teenager. He said on “The Howard Stern Show,” “I got the chance to see some things. I went there to see the lifestyle — and I saw it. But I don’t know if I could indulge and understand what I was even looking at. It was pretty wild. It was crazy.”\\n\\nThe Howard Stern Show / SiriusXM / Via youtube.com\\n\\nStern’s cohost, Robin Quivers, then asked Usher, “So nobody tried to, you know, some woman didn’t come along and…” The singer interjected and said, “I ain’t say that. I ain’t say that. What I did say is that there were very curious things taking place, and I didn’t necessarily understand it.”\\n\\nThe Howard Stern Show / SiriusXM / Via youtube.com\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nUsher also revealed that his parents knew “nothing” about him living with Diddy. When asked if he’d ever let his own child spend time at “Puffy Flavor Camp,” he firmly replied, “Hell no.”\\n\\nWith this in mind, fans are sharing their thoughts on Usher’s recent response to Palmer asking him about his first kiss during a round of quick-fire-style questions on her podcast.\\n\\nTaylor Hill via Getty Images\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“How old were you when you had your first kiss, and who was it?” she said.\\n\\nBaby, This is Keke Palmer / Via youtube.com\\n\\n“How old was I when I had my first kiss?” Usher repeated before adding, “Ummmm, that I actually intended to have?”\\n\\nBaby, This is Keke Palmer / Via youtube.com\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nPalmer jumped in, “Now wait a minute.”\\n\\nUsher went on, “You know, I had, there was a couple...you know.” Palmer then seemingly picked up on Usher’s apparent discomfort and redirected the conversation entirely.\\n\\nBaby, This is Keke Palmer / Via youtube.com\\n\\n“OK, well you know what? That one’s stupid, it’s out. Your favorite song ever, that you’ve done,” she asked instead.\\n\\nBaby, This is Keke Palmer / Via youtube.com\\n\\nThis interaction between Usher and Palmer has since sparked a heap of discourse online. One viral tweet branded Usher’s response “sad” and “telling,” while several users praised Palmer for redirecting the conversation so swiftly.\\n\\nBaby, This is Keke Palmer / Via youtube.com\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“This clip is….hm. Very sad and telling. But Keke is very sharp and social/emotionally intelligent. I see why she has gone so far in this industry. Very good interview,” one tweet read.\\n\\n“And that’s how you pick up on people’s discomforts, while subtly signaling to them that you genuinely see them. Then redirecting to make the space safer for them to feel comfortable,” someone wrote.\\n\\n“She is so exceptionally sharp and in tune with the space and emotions of others it’s amazing,” one person said of Palmer, while another user commended her for “knowing how to read the room.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“I really love them both. Keke, the amazing woman that she is, recognized and pivoted because she knew what it was. So many interviewers would have grabbed that moment for ratings,” one more post read.\\n\\nIf you or someone you know has experienced sexual assault, you can call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673), which routes the caller to their nearest sexual assault service provider. You can also search for your local center here.\\n\\nGo Ad-Free — And Protect The Free Press The next four years will change America forever.

In collaboration with the Upshot, we sent a survey to hundreds of literary luminaries, asking them to name the 10 best books published since Jan. 1, 2000.\\n\\nStephen King took part. So did Bonnie Garmus, Claudia Rankine, James Patterson, Sarah Jessica Parker, Karl Ove Knausgaard, Elin Hilderbrand, Thomas Chatterton Williams, Roxane Gay, Marlon James, Sarah MacLean, Min Jin Lee, Jonathan Lethem and Jenna Bush Hager, to name just a few. And you can also take part! Vote here and let us know what your top 10 books of the century are.\\n\\nWe hope you’ll discover a book you’ve always meant to read, or encounter a beloved favorite you’d like to pick up again. Above all, we hope you’re as inspired and dazzled as we are by the breadth of subjects, voices, opinions, experiences and imagination represented here.\\n\\nMy Tally I haven’t read any of these books yet ...

       "   'content': 'I think there are two options here that will allow ourselves to continue our lives without collapsing into total despair. The first is that a secret cell of revolutionary communists has successfully infiltrated the commissioning corridors of the Discovery channel and created its new reality show The Baldwins as a weapon to bring down western capitalism. It stars Alec and Hilaria Baldwin, their seven children and eight pets as they negotiate their chaotic family life split between their Manhattan apartment and East Hampton summer home, with two nannies and a lot of talk about love and “choosing to grow” through problems. Within 20 minutes or so I expect most of us will be prepared to man the barricades.\\n\\nThe second is that The Baldwins is actually a covert addition to the Tina Fey universe. Perhaps The Baldwins (“I have one overriding concern and that is letting seven children know that I love them”) is beyond parody because it is a parody. Maybe, still not over Alec’s consummate performance as the arrogantly oblivious TV exec Jack Donaghy in her masterwork 30 Rock, Tina Fey has made him a gift of this. Otherwise we are left with a third option; The Baldwins is just a reality show designed and timed to ease the actor’s way back into public life and affection in the wake of his trial (ultimately dismissed on procedural grounds after three days) for the involuntary manslaughter of Halyna Hutchins, the cinematographer killed in 2021 when a prop gun went off while Baldwin was rehearsing a scene. And that really would be a rare thing – a new low for television.\\n\\nCarefully curated authenticity blares from every scene. Look at the rambunctious children who do not take a telling from Hilaria in English or Spanish! Listen as she explains the truth behind the accent and her origins that recently caused the internet to accuse her of faking the way she speaks! What’s that? You’re saying she doesn’t actually explain anything but just says it with an earnest face? Get along with you, we’ve more authenticity to see! This time it’s Alec’s OCD habits! See him tidying toys and rearranging the Hamptons refrigerator! People use the term casually, says Hilaria, but look how much difficulty it causes him and their family! What’s that? The tiny glimpses we are offered of his condition shore up the myth rather than demonstrate the accuracy of what she says? Get along with you, I said! Listen to Alec likening his four sons to munchkins instead!\\n\\nWatch rapt as a laughing Hilaria confesses that Alec is a curmudgeon and set in his ways but you know what? He is also funny, kind, handsome, “extraordinarily smart” and generous. “I understand Alec because I’ve gotten to understand Alec. And I feel like the world very much misunderstands Alec. He’s a tender soul. Very raw, especially now.”\\n\\n“Now” – let’s pause for a tiny reminder – refers to that involuntary manslaughter business. During the first few episodes they are awaiting the trial. Baldwin is clearly deeply distressed by it all – Hilaria says he has been diagnosed with PTSD. At one point he mentions that he is happier asleep than awake and doesn’t know how he would have got through it without his family. In the opening episode, Hilaria makes two mentions of Hutchins, the son her death left motherless, and notes that the Baldwins’ pain cannot compare to that of the deceased’s loved ones. Which does beg the question: will this entirely unnecessary show help or further hurt the bereaved family? If Alec Baldwin truly needs the money after a wildly successful 45-year career on both the big and small screen, may I gently suggest that we no longer let actors command their own finances, but automatically appoint a board of trustees as soon as anyone makes more than six figures a year on set? Because this way really isn’t working out for anyone.\\n\\nWhatever the underlying, distasteful motives the Baldwins’ participation in this may be, the programme may simply backfire on its own terms. Baldwin – an actor cast predominantly in parts that require an unassailable presence and suavity – is so much diminished in and by it. At times he is virtually shambling round, seeming bewildered, often in a grey polo shirt that looks stained, and muttering about his kids too much like any tired, older father. That adds to the authenticity, perhaps, but loses them much more than it gains.\\n\\nThe Baldwins is dreadful, and makes the couple look likewise.'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-24T00:00:00',\n",
       "   'content': 'Today sees the debut of The Baldwins, a reality TV show about Alec and Hilaria Baldwin and their seven children. According to TLC, the show will demonstrate “what life is really like for the Baldwins – chaotic, funny, exhausting and filled with love. Alec and Hilaria’s dynamic as a couple will also take centre stage, with moments that showcase their deep partnership as they navigate challenges hand in hand.” Which, given that it is still not long since Alec Baldwin fatally shot Halyna Hutchins on the set of Rust, is quite a lot of challenges.\\n\\nBut however you view The Baldwins – either as a moneymaking necessity for a family in trouble, or something less edifying – they now join a long line of other reality show families that have opened themselves up for the public to gawp at. Here are 10 of the most notorious.\\n\\n10. Til Death Do Us Part: Carmen and Dave\\n\\nSuch was the rush for celebrity reality shows in the early 00s that they would give anyone a series. Witness 2004’s seven-episode Til Death Do Us Part, in which Baywatch star Carmen Electra prepared for her marriage to Jane’s Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro. And it was just that. Seating arrangements, location scouting, cake buying; nothing was too mundane for these hellcats. Spoiler alert: the couple filed for divorce less than three years after filming wrapped.\\n\\n9. Being Bobby Brown\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Made you wish for an intervention … Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston. Photograph: Stéphane Cardinale/Corbis/Sygma/Getty Images\\n\\nIt’s important to note that nobody wanted a reality show about Bobby Brown. But he was married to Whitney Houston, and by 2005 she was in such freefall that she had nobody to advise her against it. The resulting show was almost gratuitously unedifying. Watching any of it made you feel grubby. Watching the episode where Brown explains how he helps Houston relieve her constipation, you found yourself actively wishing for an intervention.\\n\\n8. Keeping Up With the Kardashians\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Bizarre … Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian and Khloe Kardashian in Keeping Up With the Kardashians. Photograph: Entertainment/Rex/Shutterstock\\n\\nThe Kardashians have reached such a point of cultural saturation that it is easy to overlook just how weird it is. It’s a reality show about a bunch of identical-looking Stepford Wives – trapped inside a loop of only being famous because they’ve got a show – strutting around a warehouse-sized mansion saying absolutely nothing of note. The patriarch is, retrospectively very clearly, transitioning. Kanye West drifts in and out. There is no identifiable content whatsoever. It’s bizarre.\\n\\n7. 19 Kids and Counting\\n\\nIn the US, the channel TLC carved out its own genre of competitive breeding, where your chances of landing a show directly correlated with the number of children you had. Jon and Kate Plus 8 was a good start, but they were soon eclipsed by the Duggar family, who inexplicably had 19 children. That was exploitative enough. The fact that the show was eventually hauled off-air after sexual molestation allegations against the oldest son were revealed just makes it worse.\\n\\n6. Gene Simmons Family Jewels\\n\\nFor a while there, there was no reality TV show Gene Simmons wouldn’t enthusiastically consent to. He was on Rock School. He was on Criss Angel Mindfreak. He was on the child trauma psychology show Shrink Rap. And yet his greatest contribution to the medium was Family Jewels, which ran for six years until 2012. A reality show that followed Simmons, his wife, Shannon Tweed, and his two children, it was standard enough reality fare, save for the episodes where Simmons had to take a lie detector test to see if he’d been sleeping around or not.\\n\\n5. Meet the Rees-Moggs\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Scrambling for work … Jacob and Helena Rees-Mogg with their children. Photograph: Discovery+/PA\\n\\nWhenever there is a change in government, it is inevitable that recently unelected ministers will find themselves scrambling for work. But none have been quite as desperate as Jacob Rees-Mogg, who signed his family up for a reality show the instant he saw the writing on the wall. Meet the Rees-Moggs was an attempt to show Jacob and his clan as a normal family, which is especially hard to do when you live in a mansion full of portraits of yourself and local people keep spray painting the phrase “Posh Twat” around town.\\n\\n4. Hogan Knows Best\\n\\nSometimes reality shows are deliberately structured to make their subjects look more exciting. In retrospect, Hogan Knows Best – a VH1 series about Hulk Hogan and his family – did the exact opposite. Onscreen they came across as a cartoonishly oversized and bright orange sitcom family, wayward but ultimately protective. Offscreen, Hogan’s marriage was deteriorating due to his infidelities (his wife would soon shack up with a 19-year-old) and their son crashed his car while drunk, causing his friend to be in a vegetative state.\\n\\n3. Wahlburgers\\n\\nView image in fullscreen A shameless commercial … Mark, Paul, Alma and Donnie from Wahlburgers. Photograph: A&E Network Production\\n\\nArguably a family born for reality TV, the Wahlbergs are a clan of intensely high-frequency roughneck Bostonians, comprising one Hollywood actor, one member of New Kids on the Block and an array of peripheral biological and honorary Wahlbergs including Jenny McCarthy and the guy they based Drama from Entourage on. Together, of course, they decide to start a burger franchise. The whole thing is really a shameless commercial, but an entertaining one nonetheless.\\n\\n2. Totally Scott-Lee\\n\\nFuture historians will one day write books about Totally Scott-Lee, a one-off 2005 reality series about the attempts of former Steps member Lisa Scott-Lee to launch a solo career. This was a show with real stakes, since Scott-Lee – flanked by her brother and husband – made the early wrongheaded decision to announce that she would quit the business if her first single didn’t go Top 10. Spoiler: it did not go Top 10. The moment she discovered this remains one of the most compelling of the entire genre.\\n\\n1. The Osbournes\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Every reality show since owes it a great debt … Jack Osbourne, Sharon Osbourne, Ozzy Osbourne and Kelly Osbourne. Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy\\n\\nHow could it be anything but? Aside from Anna Nicole Smith’s show, which was altogether more ugly and exploitative, The Osbournes is the original and best reality TV show. Essentially a live-action Simpsons, if Homer had also been a world-renowned rockstar, it was a full-tilt bananas show about a dysfunctional (but unquestionably loving) family. The show made stars of every member, and every reality show that followed owes it a great debt.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Netflix has plenty of movies to watch. Maybe too many. Sometimes finding the right film at the right time can seem like an impossible task. Let us help you.

Attempting to seek justice herself, aided only by outsider and nunchaku aficionado Tony (a brilliantly against-type Elijah Wood), Ruth\\'s decision descends into a disastrous experiment with vigilante justice. A wry but grim look at modern life, Ruth\\'s ultimate goal is best summed up by her answer to “what do you want?” being a blunt “for people to not be assholes.” A treatise on apathy, Macon Blair\\'s 2017 directorial debut was one of Netflix\\'s earlier forays into producing exclusive content, but it remains one of the smartest dark comedies on the platform today.\\n\\nThe Two Popes\\n\\nAt first glance, The Two Popes is not a gripping proposition: a film where two very old men in dresses talk a lot, walk around a little bit, and then talk some more. But two top-notch performances from Jonathan Pryce and Anthony Hopkins and a stellar script from Anthony McCarten turn this prosaic premise into a film worth watching. Set in the wake of the Vatican leaks scandal and loosely inspired by true events, it follows Cardinal Bergoglio as he tries to convince Pope Benedict XVI to accept his resignation. The two men couldn\\'t be more different—Benedict is an archconservative desperate to cling to tradition while Bergoglio is seen as a dangerous liberalizer who might erode the Church\\'s authority. While the two men battle out their differences, the future of Catholicism hangs in the balance. If you enjoyed the recent Conclave, this is worth your time too.\\n\\nY Tu Mamá También\\n\\nIt\\'s uncommon to find much in the way of classic films on Netflix—the algorithm must ever be fed by the churn of the new—so the availability of Alfonso Cuarón\\'s brilliant 2001 coming-of-age movie is a real delight. Set in Mexico in 1999, Y Tu Mamá También (“And your mother, too”) follows rich kid Tenoch (Diego Luna) and his working-class friend Julio (Gael García Bernal) on a road trip with Luisa (Maribel Verdú), the wife of Tenoch’s cousin. It\\'s a journey that sees the young men—still boys, really—competing for attention from the beautiful older woman, trapping themselves in lies and trying to get by on unearned confidence, all while claiming to be heading to a picture-perfect beach that they made up. As for why the much more mature and experienced Luisa would go along with them in the first place? Pack tissues. While the film courted controversy for its frank depiction of sex and drugs (it\\'s not one for family film night), it remains a masterpiece; a raucous and all-too-real examination of young friendships and fragile masculinity.\\n\\nParasite\\n\\nDirector Bong Joon-ho\\'s searing 2019 thriller is the first non-English film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, and it\\'s abundantly clear why. Its bleak exploration of economic disparity and condemnation of capitalistic excess is focused on its South Korea setting, but it resonates with global audiences. Parasite follows the struggling Kim family as they each infiltrate the lives of the wealthy Parks, posing as household servants to live a life of proximate luxury before their deception spirals wildly out of control. Somehow, it\\'s also darkly comedic, mocking the obliviousness of the rich classes, both to their own privileges and to the desperation of the poor. Throughout, it\\'s exquisitely shot and expertly paced, with Bong deftly increasing the tension with every scene until everything approaches a seemingly inevitable conclusion—and then still manages to twist and subvert audience expectations. A spectacular piece of filmmaking that deserves the hype, this examination of class and inequality feels more relevant than ever.\\n\\nThe Babadook\\n\\nThis Australian horror achieved cult status almost immediately after its release in 2014, largely due to the \"Babadiscourse\" over the LGBTQ+ status of its central supernatural figure. But writer and director Jennifer Kent\\'s chilling tale of widowed single mother Amelia (Essie Davis) trying to protect her young son from a twisted creature from a storybook is far more than the memes that enveloped it. It\\'s a tense and captivating slice of terror, tapping into fears of parenthood and the weight of grief, and it more than holds up a decade later.\\n\\nMononoke the Movie: Phantom in the Rain\\n\\nIn Edo Japan, two young women, Asa and Kame, aim to better their lives by entering the Inner Chambers of the Imperial Palace, where dozens if not hundreds of women exchange comfort for trying to bear a male heir. Yet as they enter, they find themselves trapped in something more like a cult, with a dark and unnatural presence lurking in the heart of the castle. Their only hope is a wandering man known only as the Medicine Seller, possessing the skills and knowledge to exorcise the terrifying force—but men aren’t allowed in. A follow-up to the 2007 TV anime Mononoke (also available on Netflix), this stand-alone outing is not only a masterclass in tension and supernatural horror, but thanks to its stunning visual approach evoking watercolors on parchment, it’s one of the most sumptuous and visually striking pieces of animation you’ll ever see. The first of three planned Mononoke movies, Phantom in the Rain gets this trilogy off to a sensational start.\\n\\nCarry-On\\n\\nIs a movie set at Christmas in itself a Christmas movie? That debate has surged around Die Hard for decades. Now Carry-On asks the same question. A zippy thriller from House of Wax and Black Adam director Jaume Collet-Serra, this sees TSA agent Ethan Kopek (Taron Egerton) caught in the Christmas Eve shift from hell when he’s blackmailed by a mercenary known only as the Traveler (Jason Bateman) into allowing a deadly package through security. Cue a lethal game of cat-and-mouse as Ethan tries to stop the Traveler—all with the life of Ethan’s girlfriend Nora (Sofia Carson) in the balance. It’s pulpy and schlocky in places, but this throwback action outing can’t help but entertain.\\n\\nJoy\\n\\nIn vitro fertilization may seem like a relatively mundane medical procedure nowadays, one that\\'s brought hope and family to countless people struggling to conceive, but when the procedure was developed by a trio of British scientists and medics in the 1960s and \\'70s, it was hugely controversial. That makes for powerful material for this dramatization, charting the work of nurse and embryologist Jean Purdy (Thomasin McKenzie), scientist Robert Edwards (James Norton), and surgeon Patrick Steptoe (Bill Nighy), even as they\\'re demonized by the public, the UK government, and even—perhaps especially—the church. McKenzie in particular is brilliant as Purdy, torn by her own conflict of faith at being involved in the life-changing work, which also involved providing safe abortion care to women who needed it, and struggling to deal with the ostracizing she faces from her family and community as a result. A powerful and provocative drama, even now.\\n\\nEmilia Pérez\\n\\nSaying you’ve never seen anything like Emilia Pérez is a wild understatement. Truly, how could anything described as a “trans cartel musical” be anything but arresting to watch? At the onset, Rita (Zoe Saldaña) is an exhausted lawyer in Mexico City doing work her boss takes credit for. Everything changes when she’s contacted by a cartel boss who needs her help to receive gender-affirming care. Rita obliges, launching a partnership between the two that eventually includes launching an organization to help families who have lost members to cartel violence and a (perhaps misguided) effort to reunite the mob boss, the Emilia of the film’s title (played by Spanish actress Karla Sofía Gascón), with the wife and children who believe she’s dead. Full of changes in plot and tone that are all but impossible to see coming, director Jacques Audiard’s latest remains engaging until the final moment.\\n\\nThe Karate Kid\\n\\nIf you\\'re hooked on the melee melodrama of Cobra Kai, you owe it to yourself to see where it all began. When Daniel LaRusso\\'s mother moves the family from New Jersey to California, the teenager has to face the greatest threats of 1980s teen cinema: a new school, a daunting crush, and meathead bullies. Outclassed in a brawl with rival Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka), Daniel (Ralph Macchio) convinces neighbor Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) to teach him karate. Can Mr. Miyagi\\'s teaching methods—doing chores and learning to “wax on, wax off”—really help Daniel even the odds? Spoiler: yes. Cheesy and incredibly \\'80s, The Karate Kid remains a fun watch, four decades on.\\n\\nWoman of the Hour\\n\\nA serial killer is cast as a bachelor on a dating game show, allowing him to size up his next potential victim right in front of the audience watching at home. That\\'d be a twisted setup for a slasher flick—but what\\'s horrifying about Woman of the Hour is that it\\'s based on the real-life case of Rodney Alcala, who was a contestant on The Dating Game in 1978 while in the midst of a string of murders. This dramatization isn\\'t centered on the killer, though. In her directorial debut, Anna Kendrick focuses instead on Sheryl (played by Kendrick, based on the real life Cheryl Bradshaw), the one unfortunate enough to be matched with Alcala (Daniel Zovatto), and the women who reported or suspected the killer, only to be routinely ignored by authorities. A taut thriller that makes clear the real horror lies in how easily Acala eluded attention for so long.\\n\\nDon\\'t Move\\n\\nSingle-handedly reopening the \"man or bear\" debate, Don\\'t Move follows a grieving young mother named Iris (Kelsey Asbille, Yellowstone) who is hunted through the wilderness after being injected with a paralytic agent by a stranger. With her body slowly shutting down, Iris has 20 minutes to escape or find help, all as her assailant, Richard (Finn Wittrock), coldly, implacably tracks her down. Directed by Adam Schindler and Brian Netto, and produced by Sam Raimi, this expertly paced game of cat-and-mouse rarely lets up, and Asbille gives an incredible performance as the increasingly immobile Iris. If you go down to the woods today … choose the bear.\\n\\nIt’s What’s Inside\\n\\nNine college friends reunite for a bachelor party—what could go wrong? Plenty, when one of the party games involves an experimental mind-swapping device. As the attendees play the ultimate game of Mafia, trying to guess who’s inhabiting whose body, relationships fray and their very sense of self is eroded. As the bodies start falling, you might start feeling like a player yourself, unsure if anyone can be trusted. With a talented young cast that master one another’s layered performances as they hop bodies, this fresh indie thriller from writer-director Greg Jardin masterfully balances dark humor with even darker plot twists.\\n\\nWill & Harper\\n\\nWill Ferrell likely needs no introduction, but as former head writer of Saturday Night Live, Harper Steele is more accustomed to life behind the camera. Joining the hit show in the same week back in 1995, the pair struck up a decades-long friendship—so when Harper wrote to tell Ferrell she was transitioning to live as a woman, it was a big change for them both. It also formed the basis for this beautiful, heartwarming, and often laugh-out-loud funny road trip documentary following the duo as they cross the US in an old Jeep Grand Wagoneer, reconnecting and learning what their friendship looks like now. It\\'s awkward viewing at times—some of Ferrell\\'s questions blur the line between bawdy and simply rude—but it\\'s a raw and authentic journey for them both. Beyond the personal touches, Will & Harper is a timely view of what America looks like for a trans person right now, making it possibly one of the most important documentaries Netflix has produced.\\n\\nHis Three Daughters\\n\\nAs their father approaches the end of his life, sisters Rachel (Natasha Lyonne), Katie (Carrie Coon), and Christina (Elizabeth Olsen) are forced to reconnect while waiting for the inevitable. Bleak stuff, but also grounds for masterful performances from the lead trio, with Rachel having taken on the bulk of care for months, Katie casting imperious demands despite avoiding the situation, and new-agey Christina trying to keep the peace—despite being at a breaking point herself. This is almost a locked-room piece, the apartment trapping the women, forcing them to come to terms with not only their father\\'s death but their own relationships with each other, all while Vincent (Jay O. Sanders) haunts them even before his passing. Death may loom over director Azazel Jacobs’ drama, but His Three Daughters ultimately proves oddly life-affirming.\\n\\nGrave of the Fireflies\\n\\nWhen Seita and his young sister Setsuko are orphaned in the wake of the fire-bombing of Kobe during the final days of World War II, the siblings are forced into terrible circumstances to survive. Stuck between abusive extended family and the sheer desperation of scavenging around the ruins of their destroyed hometown, it\\'s a bleak existence—and also the basis for one of Studio Ghibli\\'s finest works. Directed by Isao Takahata and based on a short story by Akiyuki Nosaka, Grave of the Fireflies is unapologetically harrowing in its exploration of how war and nationalism chew up the most vulnerable, yet peppered with moments of unwavering love as Seita attempts to protect Setsuko\\'s innocence. This searing wartime drama is sobering but essential viewing, a film that\\'s more than earned its ranking in the upper echelons of the Best Studio Ghibli films.\\n\\nRebel Ridge\\n\\nWhen corrupt cops run ex-Marine Terry Richmond (Aaron Pierre) off the road for cycling while Black, they also seize the money he had been planning to use to post his cousin’s bail. Despite the injustice, Terry tries to do everything by the book but finds almost every aspect of the legal system against him. Out of patience, and fueled by immensely justified anger, he sets about tearing out the rot from the small town, aided only by court clerk Summer (AnnaSophia Robb). Writer-director Jeremy Saulnier could have made Rebel Ridge merely a modern day First Blood, but while there’s plenty of visceral, bone-breaking fight scenes, it’s the film’s righteously angry look at the baked-in failings of the American legal system that gives this its bite—all while cementing Pierre as an action star to watch.\\n\\nWicked Little Letters\\n\\nBased on real events, Wicked Little Letters is set in 1920, in the quaint English town of Littlehampton. When the well-to-do family of Edith Swan starts receiving abusive mail, Irish immigrant Rose Gooding—who has a reputation as a foul-mouthed troublemaker, and who recently fell out with Edith—is suspect number one. Yet as the plague of \"poison pen\" notes spreads, becoming a national scandal, only overlooked police officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) believes that Rose is being set up. Oscar-winner Olivia Colman is on top form as Edith, while Jessie Buckley delights with a fiery performance as Rose in this surprisingly uproarious comedy.\\n\\nLumberjack the Monster\\n\\nFirst up: This is absolutely, positively, unquestionably not for younger viewers—but that\\'s to be expected from director Takashi Miike (Ichi the Killer). Despite veering into more family-friendly fare with the video game and manga adaptations Ace Attorney and JoJo\\'s Bizarre Adventure, Miike returns to his shock-horror slasher roots with Lumberjack the Monster. It follows Akira Ninomiya (Kazuya Kamenashi), a lawyer willing to kill to get ahead, and the city-spanning grudge match that follows when a masked serial killer—the titular Lumberjack—takes a stab at him. As gory and over-the-top as Miike has ever been, and with added edges of surreality, this isn\\'t for the squeamish, but it\\'s a captivating return to form for the infamous creator.\\n\\nThe Long Game\\n\\nBased on the true story of the San Felipe Mustangs, The Long Game follows WWII vet turned high school superintendent J.B. Peña (Jay Hernandez) in the 1950s as he forges a group of Mexican-American teenagers with natural golfing talent—but nowhere to play, thanks to the racist and exclusionary practices of the official club in their Texan town—into a championship winning team. While the film has all the hallmarks of an underdog sports movie (and maybe a few too many golfing-as-life metaphors), director Julio Quintana dodges the genre\\'s most cloying clichés, instead focusing on the frustrations and ambitions of the young players—particularly Joe Treviño (Julian Works), the de facto leader of the team who subverts expectations by rejecting even wanting to play at a club that doesn\\'t respect him. With its fantastic cast bolstered by the likes of Cheech Marin, Dennis Quaid, and Jaina Lee Ortiz, The Long Game is a beautiful tale of shattering barriers, on and off the golf course.\\n\\nUnder Paris\\n\\nThis so-serious-it\\'s-ludicrous French creature feature sees Bérénice Bejo as marine specialist Sophia Assalas, who is hunting down a mako shark that has not only spontaneously mutated to survive in the freshwater Seine but is also about to give birth to a host of baby man-eating sharks. Worse still? Paris is about to hold a triathlon, with the swim portion set to become an all-you-can-eat buffet! Look, not everything on this list needs to be high art—sometimes, you just need to see a mutant shark straight up chomping on people while increasingly desperate humans start blowing stuff up. Press Play, turn brain off, enjoy.\\n\\nHit Man\\n\\nGary Johnson (Glen Powell) is a mild-mannered professor of philosophy—and a contract killer. Well, not quite. He just poses as one, working with the New Orleans Police Department to trap people looking to hire a hit man. It\\'s a role he\\'s surprisingly good at, but when Madison (Adria Arjona) looks to have her abusive husband “dealt” with, Gary begins to fall for her—and the consequences could be fatal for real. In another creator’s hands, Hit Man might have been either overly grim or simply insubstantial (it\\'s loosely based on a true story), but director Richard Linklater leverages his signature uses of sparkling dialog and brilliantly realized characters to deliver a smart action-comedy that explores the roles people play in society as much as it serves up mistaken-identity hijinks.\\n\\nGodzilla Minus One\\n\\nDespite the presence of the eponymous kaiju, Godzilla Minus One is a film rooted in the humanity of its protagonists, deserter kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) and Noriko Ōishi (Minami Hamabe), a survivor of the bombings of Tokyo. Thrown together as an ersatz family as they raise an orphaned baby, their attempts to build a new life turn chaotic when the irradiated reptile descends on the city just as it\\'s beginning to recover. Director Takashi Yamazaki\\'s reimagining of Japan\\'s premier kaiju netted the King of Monsters its first-ever Oscar, picking up a statue for Best Visual Effects at the 2024 Academy Awards, but this is a film that exceeds mere spectacle—it\\'s a searing examination of life after war, and how a nation grapples with being on the losing side.\\n\\nSuzume\\n\\nSuzume Iwato (voiced by Nanoka Hara in Japanese, Nichole Sakura in English) lives with her aunt on Japan\\'s southern island, having lost her mother in the Tōhoku earthquake of 2011. When a handsome young stranger named Souta (Hokuto Matsumura, Josh Keaton) asks her for directions to some local ruins, she follows him out of curiosity but disturbs a living keystone, accidentally unleashing an ancient power that threatens to destroy the entire country. Drawn into Souta\\'s world, the pair chase the keystone, now in the form of a cat, across Japan in a desperate bid to reseal the destructive entity—a quest that would be easier if Souta hadn\\'t been transformed into a child\\'s wooden chair. The latest film from Makoto Shinkai (Your Name, Weathering with You), Suzume is a breathtakingly animated slice of magical realism with a surrealist edge—but beyond the spectacle, it\\'s a heart-warming tale of community and humanity, each stop on the unlikely pair\\'s journey a snapshot of people and families coming together in the wake of tragedy.\\n\\nMaboroshi\\n\\nBy any measure, Masamune lives a normal teenage existence in his rural Japanese hometown—until the local steel works erupts, mysteriously sealing the entire town in an inexplicable time bubble where no one ages. As the small community struggles to adapt, a culture that fears change emerges, initially from the presumption that residents would need to rejoin the outside world as they left it, and eventually forbids even new relationships. Yet when Masamune\\'s strange classmate Mutsumi lures him to the ill-fated factory and introduces him to a feral young girl who should not exist, the bizarre reality they all inhabit begins to collapse. A fantasy twist on notions of youthful rebellion, the prison of familiarity, and fears of change, Maboroshi—meaning \"illusion\"—is a dazzling sophomore feature from director Mari Okada—whose 2018 debut Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms won accolades around the globe—and one that firmly establishes her as one of the most exciting creators working in animation today.\\n\\nAlways Be My Maybe\\n\\nWritten by and starring Ali Wong and Randall Park, Always Be My Maybe tells the story of two inseparable childhood friends whose lives veer dramatically apart after a grief-stricken rendezvous in their teenage years. Wong plays Sasha Tran, a superstar chef whose stratospheric career barely papers over the cracks in her faltering relationship. Park, meanwhile, plays Marcus Kim, whose ambitions have taken him no further than the local dive bar and his father\\'s air conditioning firm. Fate—and a bizarre cameo from Keanu Reeves—conspire to bring the two leads back together in a thoughtful and hilarious romantic comedy.\\n\\nRustin\\n\\nDirected by George C. Wolfe (Ma Rainey\\'s Black Bottom), this biopic explores the life of civil rights activist Bayard Rustin. While perhaps best known as one of the chief organizers of 1963\\'s March on Washington, Rustin was also openly, unapologetically gay at a time when that was phenomenally rare—and the film doesn\\'t shy away from how that alienated many of the people he worked with, his sexuality often seen as a threat to the movement. A much-needed spotlight on an overlooked but pivotal figure in the Civil Rights Movement, elevated by a central performance from a spectacularly well-cast Colman Domingo as Rustin himself.\\n\\nHis House\\n\\nFleeing war-torn South Sudan, Bol (Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù) and Rial (Wunmi Mosaku) are now living in a run-down house at the edge of London, harassed by their neighbors even as they try to fit in. The couple are also haunted by the lives they left behind—both figuratively and (possibly) literally, with visions of their late daughter Nyagak, who did not survive the journey, fading in and out of the walls of their dismal new home. The real horror of His House isn\\'t the strange visions, haunted house, or potential ghosts, though—it’s the bleakness of the lives Bol and Rial are forced into, the hostility and dehumanization of the UK asylum process, the racism both overt and casual, all coupled with the enormous sense of loss they carry with them. Blending the macabre with the mundane, director Remi Weekes delivers a tense, challenging film that will haunt viewers as much as its characters.\\n\\nThe Black Book\\n\\nPaul Edima (Richard Mofe-Damijo) lives a peaceful life as a church deacon, trying to atone for—or at least forget—his former deeds as a highly trained special agent. Plans to leave his violent and bloody past behind fall apart when his son is framed for a murder and then killed by corrupt police, forcing him to fall back on old skills as he seeks vengeance. Shades of Taken, yes, but it\\'s director Editi Effiong\\'s raw energy and fresh takes on familiar action movie formulas that—backed by one of the highest budgets in \"Nollywood\" history—have this gritty outing topping the most-watched lists as far afield as South Korea. Expand your cinematic horizons and see what the fuss is about.\\n\\nThe Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar\\n\\nIgnore its 41-minute runtime and set aside any arguments over whether its brevity \"counts\" as a movie—this fantastic outing sees Wes Anderson adapt a Roald Dahl work for the first time since 2009\\'s Fantastic Mr. Fox, and the result is just as brilliant. Rather than stop-motion, as with Mr. Fox, this is a live-action affair headlined by a top tier performance from Benedict Cumberbatch as the eponymous Henry Sugar, a bored rich man who gains a strange power and ultimately uses it to better the world. With a broader cast including Dev Patel, Ralph Fiennes, and Ben Kingsley, and shot with all of Anderson\\'s trademark aesthetic sensibilities, this really is a wonderful story. And, if you\\'re still bothered by the short run time, take solace in the fact that this forms a tetraptych with The Rat Catcher, The Swan, and Poison; 15-minute shorts with same cast, directed by Anderson, and all adapting other Dahl tales in his signature style.\\n\\nEldorado: Everything the Nazis Hate\\n\\nCentered on the eponymous Berlin nightclub, this documentary explores the lives of LGBTQ+ people during the interwar years, from the roaring 1920s through the rise of the Nazis and into the horrors of World War II. With a blend of archival footage, recreations, and first-person accounts, director Benjamin Cantu paints a picture of gleeful decadence, the Eldorado as an almost hallowed ground where performers and patrons alike experimented with gender expression and were free to openly display their sexuality. It\\'s an ode to what was lost, but with an eye on the bizarre contradictions of the age, where openly gay club-goers would wear their own Nazi uniforms as the years went by. Everything the Nazis Hate is emotionally challenging viewing in places, but it serves up an important slice of queer history that many will be completely unaware of.\\n\\nMarry My Dead Body\\n\\nWu Ming-han (Greg Hsu) is not a great guy. A homophobic police officer, his life—and prejudices—are changed when he picks up an unassuming red envelope while investigating a case. Now bound under “ghost marriage” customs to Mao Mao (Austin Lin), a gay man who died under mysterious circumstances, Wu has to solve his “husband\\'s” death before he can get on with his life. Directed by Cheng Wei-hao, better known for his thrillers and horror movies, Marry My Dead Body sees the Taiwanese director bring his supernatural stylings to this ghostly absurdist comedy for a film that transcends borders.\\n\\nThey Cloned Tyrone\\n\\nDrug dealer Fontaine (John Boyega) got shot to death last night. So why has he just woken up in bed as if nothing happened? That existential question leads Fontaine and two unlikely allies—prostitute Yo-Yo (Teyonah Parris) and pimp Slick Charles (Jamie Foxx)—to uncovering a vast conspiracy centered on a Black-majority town called The Glen, where people are kept mollified by hypnotic rap music, dumbed down with drug-laced fried chicken and grape juice, and preached into obedience at church. But who’s using the town as a petri dish, and why is there a cloning lab buried underground? This lethally sharp satire from writer and debut director Juel Taylor masterfully blends genres, from the use of visual motifs and dated clichés from 1970s Blaxploitation cinema to its frequent steps into sci-fi territory and laugh-out-loud comedy. But it’s the powerhouse performances from its central cast that mark this as one to watch.\\n\\nNimona\\n\\nShapeshifter Nimona can become anything she wants, a gift that causes people to fear and shun her. If society is going to treat her like a villain, she\\'s going to be one, so she decides to become the sidekick of the hated black knight, Ballister Blackheart. Unfortunately for the aspiring menace, Blackheart isn\\'t quite the monster he\\'s made out to be, and he instead tries to rein in Nimona\\'s more murderous tendencies as he seeks to clear his name of a crime he didn\\'t commit—and face down his old friend Ambrosius Goldenloin in the process. Adapted from N. D. Stevenson\\'s groundbreaking graphic novel, Nimona is more than just another fanciful fantasy—it\\'s a tale of outsiders and exiles, people trying to do right even when their community rejects them, and the joy of finding their own little band along the way. After an almost decade-long journey to the screen, this dazzlingly animated movie has become an instant classic.\\n\\nThe Boys in the Band\\n\\nSet in New York City in 1968, The Boys in the Band is a snapshot of gay life a year before Stonewall brought LGBTQ+ rights to mainstream attention. When Michael (Jim Parsons, fresh from The Big Bang Theory) hosts a birthday party for his best frenemy Harold (Zachary Quinto), he’s expecting a night of drinks, dancing, and gossip with their inner circle—until Alan, Michael’s straight friend from college, turns up, desperate to share something. As the night wears on, personalities clash, tempers fray, and secrets threaten to come to the surface in director Joe Mantello’s tense character study. Adapted for the screen by Mart Crowley, author of the original stage play, this period piece manages to be as poignant an exploration of queer relationships and identities as ever.\\n\\nCargo\\n\\nIn a world already ravaged by a zombie-like plague, Andy Rose (Martin Freeman) only wants to keep his family safe, sticking to Australia’s rural back roads to avoid infection. After his wife is tragically bitten, and infects him in turn, Andy is desperate to find a safe haven for his infant daughter, Rosie. With a mere 48 hours until he succumbs himself, Andy finds an ally in Thoomi (Simone Landers), an Aboriginal girl looking to protect her own rabid father. But with threats from paranoid survivalists and Aboriginal communities hunting the infected, it may already be too late. A unique twist on the zombie apocalypse, Cargo abandons the familiar urban landscapes of the genre for the breathtaking wilds of Australia and offers a slower, character-led approach to the end of the world.\\n\\nGuillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio\\n\\nThe modern master of the macabre brings the wooden would-be boy to life like never before in this exquisitely animated take on Pinocchio. In a stop-motion masterpiece that hews closer to the original 1880s tale by Carlo Collodi than the sanitized Disney version, Guillermo del Toro adds his own signature touch and compelling twists to the classic story that make it darkly enchanting—expect a Blue Fairy closer to a biblically accurate many-eyed angel and a Terrible Dogfish more like a kaiju. It’s the decision to transplant the tale to World War II that’s most affecting though. Cast against the rise of fascism, with Gepetto mourning the loss of his son, the film is packed with complex themes of mortality and morality that will haunt audiences long after the credits roll. If that doesn\\'t sell you, perhaps the fact that it won Best Animated Feature at the 2023 Academy Awards will.\\n\\nCall Me Chihiro\\n\\nAn idyllic slice-of-life movie with a twist, Call Me Chihiro follows a former sex worker—the eponymous Chihiro, played by Kasumi Arimura—after she moves to a seaside town to work in a bento restaurant. This isn’t a tale of a woman on the run or trying to escape her past—Chihiro is refreshingly forthright and unapologetic, and her warmth and openness soon begin to change the lives of her neighbors. Directed by Rikiya Imaizumi, this is an intimate, heartfelt character drama that alternates between moments of aching loneliness and sheer joy, packed with emotional beats that remind viewers of the importance of even the smallest connections.\\n\\nThe Sea Beast\\n\\nIt\\'s easy to imagine that the elevator pitch for The Sea Beast was “Moby Dick meets How to Train Your Dragon”—and who wouldn’t be compelled by that? Set in a fantasy world where oceanic leviathans terrorize humanity, those who hunt down the giant monsters are lauded as heroes. Jacob Holland (voiced by Karl Urban) is one such hero, adopted son of the legendary Captain Crowe and well on the way to building his own legacy as a monster hunter—a journey disrupted by stowaway Maisie Brumble (Zaris-Angel Hator), who has her own ambitions to take on the sea beasts. However, after an attempt to destroy the colossal Red Bluster goes disastrously wrong, Jacob and Maisie are stranded on an island filled with the creatures, and they find that the monsters may not be quite so monstrous after all. A rollicking sea-bound adventure directed by Chris Williams—of Big Hero 6 and Moana fame—it secured its standing as one of Netflix’s finest movies with a nomination for Best Animated Feature at this year\\'s Oscars.\\n\\nGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\\n\\nDaniel Craig reprises his role as detective Benoit Blanc in this brilliant follow-up to 2019’s phenomenal whodunnit, Knives Out. Writer-director Rian Johnson crafts a fiendishly sharp new case for “the Last of the Gentlemen Sleuths,” taking Blanc to a Greek island getaway for a reclusive tech billionaire and his collection of friends and hangers-on, where a planned murder mystery weekend takes a deadly turn. While totally accessible for newcomers, fans of the first film will also be rewarded with some deeper character development for Blanc, a role that’s shaping up to be as iconic for Craig as 007. As cleverly written and meticulously constructed as its predecessor, and featuring the kind of all-star cast—Edward Norton! Janelle Monáe! Kathryn Hahn! Leslie Odom Jr.! Jessica Henwick! Madelyn Cline! Kate Hudson! Dave Bautista!—that cinema dreams are made of, Glass Onion might be the best thing Netflix has dropped all year.\\n\\nThe Wonder\\n\\nFlorence Pugh dazzles in this not-quite-horror film from Oscar-winning director Sebastián Lelio. Set in 1862, English nurse Lib Wright (Pugh) is sent to Ireland to observe Anna O’Donnell, a girl who claims to have not eaten in four months, subsisting instead on “manna from heaven.” Still grieving the loss of her own child, Lib is torn between investigating the medical impossibility and growing concern for Anna herself. Amid obstacles in the form of Anna’s deeply religious family and a local community that distrusts her, Lib’s watch descends into a tense, terrifying experience. Based on a book of the same name by Emma Donoghue, The Wonder is a beautiful yet bleakly shot period piece that explores the all-too-mortal horrors that unquestioning religious fervor and family secrets can wreak.\\n\\nRRR\\n\\nOne of India’s biggest films of all time, RRR (or Rise, Roar, Revolt) redefines the notion of cinematic spectacle. Set in 1920, the historical epic follows real-life Indian revolutionaries Alluri Sitrama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (N. T. Rama Rao Jr.) but fictionalizes their lives and actions. Although they come from very different walks of life, their similarities draw them together as they face down sadistic governor Scott Buxton (Ray Stevenson) and his cruel wife, Catherine (Alison Doody). No mere period fluff, RRR is a bold, exciting, and often explosive piece of filmmaking that elevates its heroes to near-mythological status. Director S. S. Rajamouli deploys brilliantly shot action scenes—and an exquisitely choreographed dance number—that grab viewers’ attention and refuse to let go. Whether you’re a longtime fan of Indian cinema or just looking for an action flick beyond the Hollywood norm, RRR is not to be missed.\\n\\nI Lost My Body\\n\\nAn award winner at Cannes in 2019, this tale of burgeoning young love, obsession, and autonomous body parts is every bit as weird as you might expect for a French adult animated film. Director Jérémy Clapin charts the life of Naoufel, a Moroccan immigrant in modern-day France who falls for the distant Gabrielle, and Naoufel’s severed hand, which makes its way across the city to try to reconnect. With intersecting timelines and complex discussions about fate, I Lost My Body is often mind-bending yet always captivating, and Clapin employs brilliantly detailed animation and phenomenal color choices throughout. Worth watching in both the original French and the solid English dub featuring Dev Patel and Alia Shawkat, this one dares you to make sense of it all.\\n\\nDon’t Look Up\\n\\nFrustrated by the world’s collective inaction on existential threats like climate change? Maybe don’t watch Don’t Look Up, director Adam McKay’s satirical black comedy. When two low-level astronomers discover a planet-killing comet on a collision course with Earth, they try to warn the authorities—only to be met with a collective “meh.” Matters only get worse when they attempt to leak the news themselves and have to navigate vapid TV hosts, celebrities looking for a signature cause, and an indifferent public. A bleakly funny indictment of our times, bolstered by a star-studded cast fronted by Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence, Don’t Look Up is, somewhat depressingly, one of the best portraits of humanity since Idiocracy.'},\n",

He doesn\\'t disappoint with his performance as former US president George Mullen—pulled out of retirement to oversee a commission investigating a colossal cyberattack that left thousands of Americans dead and the terrifying warning that \"this will happen again\"—commanding the screen with his trademark gravitas. Director Lesli Linka Glatter wrings great drama from the whodunit of it all (Russians? hackers? hedge fund bros?), but with Mullen handed unprecedented powers to track down the culprits, the real nail-biting moments come from its suddenly timely explorations of abuses of power. With a powerhouse cast that includes Angela Bassett, Lizzy Caplan, and Jesse Plemons, Zero Day is an engaging political thriller, and at six episodes it makes for a great binge-watch.\\n\\nApple Cider Vinegar\\n\\nInfluencers have been known to hawk nonsense diets and spurious “wellness” regimens, but few have ever done it like Belle Gibson, the real-life Australian influencer who went as far as faking brain cancer for attention. And while she hailed alternative diets and whole foods for keeping her nonexistent illness at bay—launching an app and cookbook in the process—actual cancer sufferers paid the price for her extreme narcissism and greed. This dramatized limited series—“a true-ish story … based on a lie,” as Netflix puts it—makes for uncomfortably gripping viewing as it charts the rise and fall of Gibson (Kaitlyn Dever, with a flawless Aussie accent) and her rivalry with Milla Blake (Alycia Debnam-Cary), a fellow influencer and actual cancer patient. Better than doomscrolling reels on Instagram or TikTok, and a reminder that everyone should be a lot more skeptical of anything influencers are shilling on social media.\\n\\nThe Night Agent\\n\\nSpecial agent Peter Sutherland (Gabriel Basso) is back, and the stakes have never been higher. While the first season of The Night Agent wove a compelling spy drama out of the idea of a mole at the heart of America\\'s intelligence services, the newly arrived second season takes a more global approach—Sutherland hunts down a stolen chemical weapon project, drawing him back into the orbit of tech savant and sometime love interest Rose Larkin (Luciane Buchanan), while Iranian diplomatic aide Noor Taheri (Arienne Mandi) offers secrets to the CIA in return for asylum, and a deposed Eastern European dictator aims to manipulate everything from behind bars. Sure, the show’s mix of politics and spook work won’t surprise genre diehards, but it weaves together its many influences—and many more plot threads—into a supremely entertaining thriller.\\n\\nAsura\\n\\nThe four Takezawa sisters are close but have little in common. Eldest Tsunako (Rie Miyazawa) is already a widow; repressed Takiko (Yû Aoi) and rebellious Sakiko (Suzu Hirose) are always at each other\\'s throats; and second-born Makiko (Machiko Ono) tries to balance keeping the peace with being a housewife and mother to her own two children. Yet when Takiko learns that their father Kotaro (Jun Kunimura) may have a second, secret, family, the sisters’ bonds are put to the test as they struggle to uncover the truth. Asura is far more than a turgid family drama—it\\'s equal parts heartwarming and hilarious, capturing the complexities of the relationships between its quartet of protagonists. Keeping the 1970s setting of Kuniko Mukōda’s original novel allows Palme d’Or– winning director Hirokazu Kore-eda (Shoplifters) to craft a gorgeously shot period piece that still feels incredibly timely and modern.\\n\\nCastlevania: Nocturne\\n\\nIn the midst of the French Revolution, citizens rise up against a parasitic ruling class—but vampire hunter Richter Belmont and his magic-wielding allies Maria and Annette are more concerned with what\\'s literally bleeding the people dry. The first season of this grisly adult animated series saw the team coming together to face the rise of a \"Vampire Messiah\" prophesied to devour the sun, but the new second season ratchets up the action as the heroes team with Alucard, son of Dracula, to try to restore light to the world. Let\\'s just say the stakes (sorry) have never been higher. While Nocturne\\'s second season has some closer links to the previous Castlevania animated series, it still works perfectly well on its own, delivering high quality animation, brilliant action, and a fantastic cast of characters to sink your teeth into (sorry, again).\\n\\nSakamoto Days\\n\\nTaro Sakamoto used to be the worst of the worst, a hit man par excellence, his lethal skills making him a legendary figure in the criminal underworld. Then he fell in love, got married, and retired to run a convenience store with his wife Aoi and their daughter Hana. Unfortunately, he didn\\'t exactly leave his old job on the best of terms, and now a cadre of killers are out for the billion yen bounty on his head. Luckily, Sakamoto\\'s lost none of his skills—even though he has let himself go in other areas—but can he protect his family without breaking Aoi\\'s strict “no killing” rule? Based on the manga by Yuto Suzuki, this comedy-action anime is a blast, and with a new episode each Saturday rather than Netflix\\'s usual drop-it-all-at-once model, it\\'s appointment viewing you won\\'t want to miss.\\n\\nJentry Chau vs the Underworld\\n\\nYou know the drill—everyday teenager learns she has superpowers and is destined to fight the forces of darkness. Except Jentry Chau (voiced by Ali Wong) is not like any other teenage girl—she’s known about the supernatural her whole life (her uncontrollable fire powers were a giveaway) and spent a lifetime avoiding it. Sent to study in Korea for her own safety, Jentry is drawn back into the mystic world after being attacked in Seoul by a jiangshi named Ed (Bowen Yang). Brought back to her home in Texas by her great-aunt, Jentry has to survive not only the formidable mogui Mr. Cheng, who intends to drain her soul and powers, but the horrors of high school, culture shock, and the pain of her own past. Taking the “high school is hell” metaphor of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, adding a dash of Gravity Falls’ mystery, and rooting it all in Asian mythology, Jentry Chau vs the Underworld is one of Netflix’s freshest animated shows in years.\\n\\nMissing You\\n\\nNetflix’s latest adaptation of a Harlan Coben novel sees British police detective Kat Donovan (Rosalind Eleazar) drawn into a web of betrayal and conspiracy when she finds her former fiancé, Josh (Ashley Walters), on a dating app—11 years after his disappearance. It’s far more than a brutal ghosting though, as a missing woman was last seen with him, and Josh’s vanishing may have connections to the murder of Kat’s own father. Missing You may feel slightly padded at times—annoying when it’s only five episodes to begin with—but this twisty crime thriller is perfect viewing for the cold winter months.\\n\\nSquid Game\\n\\nProduced in Korea, Squid Game blends Hunger Games and Parasite with a battle-royal-style contest. Hundreds of desperate, broke people are recruited to a contest where they can win enough money to never need to worry about their debts again. All they have to do to win the ₩45.6 billion ($35.8 million) jackpot is complete six children’s games. But it’s not that simple: All the games have a twist, and very few people make it out alive. Squid Game is intense, brutal, and often very graphic, but it is also completely gripping. After the show became a cultural phenomenon in 2021, fans waited what felt like an eternity for another season. That second season finally dropped on December 26.\\n\\nQueer Eye\\n\\nA reformatted Fab Five return, ready to change the lives of 10 new heroes. Relocating to Las Vegas, the ninth season of Queer Eye sees Karamo, Tan, Antoni, Jonathan, and new host Jeremiah Brent—taking Bobby Berk\\'s seat as the design whiz—helping a retired showgirl regain her sparkle, organizing a dream wedding for new parents, and, in possibly their strangest case yet, teaching a magic dragon to shed his scaly exterior. No, really. Netflix\\'s most feel-good show.\\n\\nNo Good Deed\\n\\nTake Selling Sunset and add a grisly tragicomic twist and you just about have No Good Deed. A dark comedy from Liz Feldman, creator of Dead to Me, this eight-part series starts with Lydia and Paul Morgan (Lisa Kudrow and Ray Romano) putting their gorgeous home on the market, and descends into darker territory as prospective buyers go to ever more desperate attempts to get their hands on the house, nosy neighbors interfere, and the grisly history of the house itself threatens to come to light. Buoyed by a stellar cast including Teyonah Parris, Abbi Jacobson, Luke Wilson, and Denis Leary, this is a glossy, witty, and possibly only slightly exaggerated take on the brutality of the Los Angeles property market.\\n\\nA Man on the Inside\\n\\nThe latest show from comedy mastermind Michael Schur (The Good Place, Parks and Recreation, Brooklyn Nine-Nine), A Man on the Inside features Ted Danson as Charles Nieuwendyk, a retired engineering professor who\\'s lost all direction since his wife passed. But when private investigator Julie Kovalenko (Lilah Richcreek Estrada) needs a man of his demographic to go undercover in a retirement community to investigate allegations of resident abuse, Charles may find an unlikely new lease on life—if he can figure out how to use his smartphone, that is. Reflecting on end-of-life realities as much as it plays up Charles\\' fish-out-of-water situation, it\\'s a show that\\'s equal parts poignant, melancholic, and achingly funny—and it\\'s based on a true story, to boot.\\n\\nBlack Doves\\n\\nHelen Webb (Keira Knightley) is wife to the UK defense secretary, mother to two children, and bored with her picture-perfect life. Spectacular cover then, since she\\'s actually a spy for the mercenary organization Black Doves, selling state secrets to the highest bidder. But when her real love Jason (Andrew Koji) is killed, Helen is determined to find out who killed him and why—and her pursuit of the truth threatens both her public and private lives. Paired with assassin and old friend Sam (Ben Whishaw, in a very different spy role to his turn in the James Bond films) at the behest of stern operator Mrs. Reed (Sarah Lancashire), Helen\\'s obsession could have led to a dour, gritty thriller, but Black Doves bucks the grim-dark trend to serve up a pulpy, colorful outing with enough heart to balance its violence. At only six episodes (with a second season already confirmed), it\\'s a brisk watch too.\\n\\nArcane\\n\\nAnimated series based on video games can run the gamut from cheap cash-ins to half-decent if forgettable tie-ins, inaccessible to anyone but hardcore devotees. Yet Arcane stood out by making its connections to Riot Games\\' League of Legends almost optional. While its central figures, orphaned sisters Vi and Jinx, are playable characters in the game, this steampunk saga of class war, civil uprising, and the people caught in between is entirely accessible. The second and final season, released in a trio of movie-length blocks of three episodes apiece, escalates the conflict between the warring factions but never loses its central focus on the fractured relationship between sisters. With a gorgeous painterly art style, strong characters, and frequently shocking story beats, Arcane is one of the best animated series in years—and it has racked up plenty of awards, including a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program, to prove it.\\n\\nCobra Kai\\n\\nPicking up decades after Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence’s iconic fight at the end of the first Karate Kid movie, Cobra Kai initially follows a washed-up Johnny as he reopens the Cobra Kai karate dojo, finding new purpose after defending his young neighbor Miguel (Xolo Maridueña, Blue Beetle) in a fight. Over the course of six seasons, the stakes get higher—and frankly, increasingly, gloriously, ludicrous—as rival martial arts schools start cropping up all over California. Alliances are forged and broken with alarming regularity, and everything gears toward a global battle for karate supremacy. It’s all a little bit tongue-in-cheek, and with Ralph Macchio and William Zabka reprising their 1980s roles, the show is an unabashed love letter to the classic action flicks, but thanks to some seriously impressive fights and stunt work, it’s a retro-styled delight.\\n\\nHellbound\\n\\nImagine a supernatural figure appeared and told you precisely when you were going to die—what would you do? Now, imagine if this wasn\\'t a one-off personal experience, and society as a whole was aware of such warnings from beyond. Forget the giant smoke demons dragging foretold victims to hell, the societal shifts are the real hook of this striking South Korean horror series from Train to Busan director Yeon Sang-ho. The first season delved into complex theological issues such as the nature of sin and justice, while the newly arrived second season takes things further with a series of very public resurrections, further shaking a world already on the brink of existential chaos. Hellbound remains one of the most innovative horror shows in years.\\n\\nThe Diplomat\\n\\nIf there\\'s a West Wing-shaped hole in your life, look no further than The Diplomat—a tense geopolitical thriller elevated by a superb central performance by The Americans\\' Keri Russell as Kate Wyler, newly appointed US ambassador to the UK. Far from being an easy assignment in a friendly country, Kate\\'s role coincides with an attack on a British aircraft carrier, leaving her to defuse an international crisis while also navigating her fraying \"special relationship\" with husband Hal (Rufus Sewell). The second season picks up from a literally explosive cliffhanger and propels Kate into a political conspiracy—and a potential promotion to vice president. Some of the twists along the way are faintly ridiculous, but The Diplomat has become one of Netflix\\'s biggest hits in recent years, and a third season is already in the works.\\n\\nNobody Wants This\\n\\nStop us if you\\'ve heard this one before: An agnostic sex podcaster and a Rabbi walk into a party … OK, it\\'s not quite a setup for a joke, but rather for a sharp romcom—one based, in exaggerated form, on creator Erin Foster\\'s own experiences. Joanne (Kristen Bell, The Good Place) is cynical and burned out on modern dating, even as it provides her material for the increasingly successful podcast she hosts with her sister Morgan (Justine Lupe). When she meets young, handsome Noah (Adam Brody, The OC), the attraction is instant and mutual—except he\\'s just broken up with the stereotypical Nice Jewish Girl™ his family expected him to settle down with. Yet as the pair swirl through each other\\'s lives, the show proves it\\'s less about culture clash than it is exploring what the seemingly mismatched pair are willing to change and sacrifice to make their burgeoning relationship work. With sizzling chemistry between its leads, Nobody Wants This is a romcom with an emphasis on the romance.\\n\\nHeartstopper\\n\\nOne of the most joyful shows on Netflix returns for another school year of teen drama and heartfelt queer romance. In the long-awaited third season, things heat up between the central couple, with Charlie (Joe Locke) preparing to say three little words to Nick (Kit Connor) for the first time, while Elle (Yasmin Finney) and Tao (William Gao) try to have the perfect romantic summer before Elle starts art college. Heartstopper\\'s return also sheds some of its earlier cloying tendencies, growing up alongside its talented young cast and giving them more serious material to work with, tackling more mature themes of sex, eating disorders, and gender dysphoria—all without losing the warmth and charm that made audiences fall in love with the show in the first place. The show younger LGBTQ+ viewers need now, older ones needed years ago, and one that everyone needs to watch, whatever their sexuality.\\n\\nTerminator Zero\\n\\nWatch the above trailer for Terminator Zero and you might think it\\'s merely an animated repeat of the highlights from James Cameron\\'s first two Terminator films—and to an extent, you\\'d be right. But look beyond the familiar imagery of cyborg cops hunting down innocent humans and plucky resistance fighters pushing back against AI-driven extinction, and you\\'ll find one of the sharpest entries in the Terminator franchise in years. The first half of this eight-episode series treads that familiar ground, with computer engineer Malcolm Lee (voiced by André Holland, English language; Yuuya Uchida, Japanese) and his children in 1997 Tokyo targeted by Skynet\\'s murder-bots from the future for his work developing Kokoro (Rosario Dawson/Atsumi Tanezaki), an intelligence system to rival Skynet, which he somehow knows is set to bring about Judgment Day. With only human resistance soldier Eiko (Sonoya Mizuno/Toa Yukinari) able to protect them, there\\'s plenty of the kinetic, visceral action that Terminator is known for. The back half, though, brings considerably more depth, tapping into the often overlooked hard sci-fi elements of the universe, exploring time travel and paradoxes alongside existentialist discussions on the nature of consciousness. The best balance of brains and brawn since Terminator II.\\n\\nBaby Reindeer\\n\\nStalking is no laughing matter, which makes this dramatized—and highly controversial—retelling of Scottish comedian Richard Gadd\\'s own real-life experiences more than a little uncomfortable. Adapted from Gadd\\'s one-man stage show of the same name, Baby Reindeer follows Donny (Gadd, playing a fictionalized version of himself) after he meets Martha (Jessica Gunning) at the pub he works at. Despite claiming to be a lawyer, Martha can\\'t afford a drink—and a sympathetic gesture on Donny\\'s part opens the door to increasingly obsessive and dangerous behavior as she proceeds to infiltrate his life. It\\'s shockingly honest and self-aware in places—does Donny, and by extension Gadd, on some level relish the attention of his stalker? Are his occasional moments of kindness and warmth toward Martha inviting her further in? Is he using her, finding her a strange source of material for his stand-up career? A fiercely paced seven episodes, shot more like a horror movie, this Emmy-winning miniseries explores trauma and intimacy, shame and masculinity, and how society often silences the victims of abuse.\\n\\nThe Boyfriend\\n\\n\"Anyone can fall in love with anyone\" is the opening narration to The Boyfriend, Japan\\'s first same-sex dating show—a bold and progressive statement that reflects the shifting tide of opinion in the country. Throwing nine single men together in an idyllic beach house for a summer and charging them with running a coffee truck, the over-arching concept is to see who\\'ll pair up, but the series is as interested in exploring the friendships that emerge between the cast as it is the romantic relationships. Unlike Western dating shows, there are no scandals, no dramatic twists, no betrayals, and the “challenges” are adorably focused on confessing feelings. The gentleness of it all adds an almost relaxing quality, with the men discussing their emotions—and the nature of being queer in Japan—earnestly. An absolutely joyful example of reality TV.\\n\\nKleo\\n\\nIf you’re pining for more Killing Eve, then this German thriller may be the next best thing. Set in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the series follows the eponymous Kleo (Jella Haase), a Stasi assassin imprisoned by her agency on false treason charges. Released after the fall of the Berlin Wall, she seeks revenge on her former handlers—but West German detective Sven (Dimitrij Schaad), the only witness to her last kill, may have something to say about that. As dark and violent as you\\'d expect given the period and the themes of betrayal and vengeance, Kleo is lightened by its oft-deranged sense of humor and a charismatic lead duo who brilliantly bounce off one another—chemistry that\\'s only heightened in the second season as Kleo\\'s pursuit of her old allies intensifies, attracting attention from international spy agencies in the aftermath of the Cold War.\\n\\nSweet Home\\n\\nBased on the Korean webcomic by Kim Carnby and Hwang Young-chan, Sweet Home offers a very different vision of apocalyptic end times—rather than pandemics, disasters, or even zombies, this posits an end of the world brought about by people\\'s transformation into grotesque monsters, each unique and seemingly based on their deepest desires when they were human. The first season is a masterclass in claustrophobic horror, as the residents of an isolated, run-down apartment building—chiefly suicidal teen Cha Hyun-su (Song Kang), former firefighter Seo Yi-kyung (Lee Si-young), and Pyeon Sang-wook (Lee Jin-wook), who may be a brutal gangster—battle for survival. The second and third seasons explore what remains of the wider world, delving into the true nature of both monster and man—and if there\\'s any hope for what remains of humanity. With phenomenal effects work blending prosthetics, CGI, and even stop-motion animation for some disturbingly juddering creatures, this stands apart from the horror crowd.\\n\\nStar Trek Prodigy\\n\\nParamount+\\'s loss remains Netflix\\'s gain, as the streamer\\'s license rescue of this great Star Trek spin-off warps into its second season. After escaping a distant prison planet and becoming Starfleet cadets under the watchful eye of Star Trek Voyager\\'s Admiral Janeway (voiced by the venerable Kate Mulgrew), the ragtag crew—led by aspiring captain Dal R\\'El and bolstered by astrolinguist Gwyndala, engineer Jankom Pog, energy being Zero, scientist Rok-Tahk, and indestructible, gelatinous Murf—find themselves cast through time on the most dangerous mission of their young lives. While aimed at younger audiences and intended as an intro to the wider Trek universe and its ethics, Prodigy packs in plenty for older Trekkers to appreciate, particularly with a slate of returning Star Trek legends voiced by their original actors. Prodigy is something of a sleeper hit, but one of the best Trek shows in years.\\n\\nSupacell\\n\\nOne by one, five Black Londoners awaken to strange superpowers. Struggling father Andre (Eric Kofi-Abrefa) develops superstrength, nurse Sabrina (Nadine Mills) unleashes phenomenal telekinetic might, drug dealer Rodney (Calvin Demba) races at superspeed, and wannabe gang leader Tazer (Josh Tedeku) turns invisible. But it\\'s Michael (Tosin Cole, Doctor Who) who may be the most pivotal, realizing he can leap through time and space and learning he only has three months to save his fiancée\\'s life. Created by Andrew “Rapman” Onwubolu, Supacell is a show about superpowers, but not necessarily superheroes, with its fantastic cast offering up a far more realistic and human exploration of now-familiar ideas than anything you\\'ll find in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And the mystery of why—and how—only Black people seem to be gaining powers builds up to a more powerful punch than an Asgardian god of thunder. A smart, modern, and refreshing take on the genre.\\n\\nThe Good Place\\n\\nAfter suffering an improbable and humiliating death, Eleanor (Kristen Bell) finds herself in “The Good Place,” a perfect neighborhood inhabited by the world\\'s worthiest people. The only problem? She\\'s not meant to be there. Desperate to not be sent to “The Bad Place,” she tries to correct her behavior in the afterlife, with the help of her assigned soulmate, philosophy professor Chidi (William Jackson Harper). A twist at the end of the first season remains one of the best ever, while the show\\'s ability to sprinkle ethical and philosophical precepts into a sitcom format is frankly astounding. With a sensational cast rounded out by Manny Jacinto, Jameela Jamil, D\\'Arcy Carden, and Ted Danson, The Good Place more than earns its place in the good place of TV history.\\n\\nBridgerton\\n\\nStill ranking as one of Netflix’s most-watched series ever, Bridgerton is set during the Regency period in England and follows the powerful Bridgerton family as they navigate love, marriage, and scandal—with most of the latter stirred up by the gossip columns penned by the anonymous Lady Whistledown. Created for screen by Chris Van Dusen and executive produced by Shonda Rhimes, this incredibly bingeable and shockingly entertaining show is based on a series of novels by Julia Quinn, with each season focusing on a different branch of the Bridgerton tree. The third and latest season sees the spotlight fall on the long-simmering relationship between wallflower Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) and Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton), a pairing that threatens to reveal powerful secrets that have been bubbling away since the very first episode.\\n\\nBodkin\\n\\nWhen American podcaster Gilbert Power (Will Forte) and his enthusiastic assistant Emmy Sizergh (Robyn Cara) descend on the sleepy Irish town of Bodkin—reluctantly aided by investigative journalist Dove Maloney (a brilliantly acerbic Siobhán Cullen, cussing out everyone who glances her way)—he thinks he\\'s going to crack a decades-old missing-persons cold case. What he finds is a community with absolutely zero interest in his investigation, and even less in his attempts to “connect” with his Irish roots. But before long, the villagers\\' quirky behavior starts to feel stereotypical, performative even—and Power realizes the cold case may not be quite so chilly. Bodkin suffers from a slow start—give it at least two episodes before writing it off as not for you—but once this darkly comedic mystery gets going, you\\'ll likely be just as invested as in your favorite true crime podcast. (Just don\\'t take inspiration and try sleuthing any cold cases yourself.)\\n\\n3 Body Problem\\n\\nIn 1960s China, at the height of the Cultural Revolution, gifted scholar Wenjie Ye witnesses her physicist father being beaten to death for his research, only for her to be recruited to a secret project relying on that same knowledge. Fast-forward to the present day, and physics is broken: Particle accelerators around the world are delivering impossible data, while scientists are being plagued by countdowns only they can see. Meanwhile, strange VR headsets appear to be transporting players to an entirely different world—and humanity’s continued existence may rely on there being no “game over.” Game of Thrones’ creators D. B. Weiss and David Benioff and True Blood executive producer Alexander Woo reimagine Chinese author Cixin Liu’s acclaimed hard sci-fi trilogy of first contact and looming interplanetary conflict as a more global affair. Wildly ambitious, and boasting an international cast featuring the likes of Benedict Wong, Rosalind Chao, Eiza González, and GOT alum John Bradley, Netflix\\'s 3 Body Problem serves up the opening salvo in a richly detailed and staggeringly complex saga.\\n\\nRipley\\n\\nPerhaps best known nowadays from 1999’s The Talented Mr. Ripley starring Matt Damon, novelist Patricia Highsmith’s inveterate criminal Tom Ripley has a longer, darker legacy in print and on the screen. For this limited series, creator Steven Zaillian goes back to Highsmith\\'s original text, presenting Ridley (a never-more-sinister Andrew Scott of All of Us Strangers) as a down-on-his-luck con man in 1950s New York who is recruited by a wealthy shipbuilder to travel to Italy and persuade the businessman’s spoiled son Dickie Greenleaf (Johnny Flynn) to return home. But once in Italy, Ripley finds himself enamored with Dickie\\'s lavish lifestyle—and will do anything to take it for himself. Shot in black and white to really sell its noir credentials, this is an instant contender for the finest interpretation of Highsmith\\'s works to date.\\n\\nGirls5eva\\n\\nSaving it from Peacock after two seasons, Netflix has gotten the band back together for this sharp comedy from creator Meredith Scardino. Twenty years after they split up, girl group Girls5Eva—Dawn (Sara Bareilles), Gloria (Paula Pell), Summer (Busy Philipps), and Wickie (Renée Elise Goldsberry)—find themselves back in demand after their one big hit is sampled by popular rapper Li\\'l Stinker (Jeremiah Craft). Turning their renewed popularity into an opportunity to reunite, the women try to gain the stardom, respect, and musical integrity they never had in their youth, even as life has taken them in very different directions. Poking fun at the absurdity of the late ’90s/early ’00s pop scene—and how little has changed since—and heightened by an almost surrealist edge in places, Girls5eva is a comedy that deserves its time in the spotlight.\\n\\nAvatar: The Last Airbender\\n\\nA talented young cast bring to life the tale of Aang (Gordon Cormier), the latest in a long line of avatars who can control all four cardinal elements, but is frozen in time for a century when his world needed him most. Awakened by new friends Katara (Kiawentiio) and Sokka (Ian Ousley), he sets about continuing his training as the Avatar in an attempt to restore balance, all the while pursued by the relentless Prince Zuko (Dallas Liu), heir to the imperialist Fire Nation that has conquered the world. Consider this a cautious recommendation—the original animated version, also on Netflix, remains superior—but Netflix\\'s live action Avatar remake serves up scale and spectacle, without betraying the heart of the classic show. It\\'s also already confirmed for two more seasons, so viewers can look forward to the complete saga without the now-familiar Netflix cancellation worries.\\n\\nThe Legend of Korra\\n\\nIf you\\'re still not sold on the live-action Avatar, this sequel to the original series is well worth your time. Set 70 years after the animated Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Legend of Korra explores how Aang\\'s world has progressed after decades of relative peace. When Korra, the new Avatar, moves to Republic City to complete her training under the tutelage of Tenzin—Aang\\'s son, now with a family of his own—she finds herself and new friends Mako and Bolin caught in the growing tensions between element benders and the Equalist movement, who claim the unpowered are an oppressed class. As the series progresses over its four seasons, The Legend of Korra proves itself a very different beast than its predecessor, exploring political themes and social prejudices in deeper—and often darker—detail, while also expanding the more fantastic elements of the universe and revealing the origins of the first Avatar. Even more brilliantly animated, and with a unique 1920s inspired aesthetic, Korra is a show that grew up alongside its audience, and is all the stronger for it.\\n\\nBeef\\n\\nEver been cut off in traffic? Ever had it happen when you’re having a really bad day? Ever just wanted to take the low road, chase the person down and make them pay?! Then—after a few deep breaths—Beef is the show for you. It\\'s a pressure valve for every petty grievance you’ve ever suffered, following rich Amy (Ali Wong) and struggling Danny (Steven Yeun) as they escalate a road rage encounter into a vengeance-fueled quest to destroy the other. Yet Beef is more than a city-wide revenge thriller—it\\'s a biting look at how crushing modern life can be, particularly in its LA setting, where extravagant wealth brushes up against inescapable poverty and seemingly no one is truly happy. Part dramedy, part therapy, Beef is a bad example of conflict resolution but a cathartic binge watch that clearly resonates—as evidenced by its growing clutch of awards, including the Golden Globe for Best Limited Series.\\n\\nLoudermilk\\n\\nSomething of a sleeper hit for years—its first two seasons debuted on AT&T\\'s now-defunct pay TV channel Audience in 2017, before its third season appeared over on Amazon—all three seasons of this bleak comedy are now available on Netflix. Ron Livingston stars as Sam Loudermilk, a vitriolic former music critic and recovering alcoholic who proves almost pathologically incapable of holding his tongue when faced with life\\'s small frustrations—a personality type possibly ill-suited to leading others through addiction support groups. It\\'s dark in places, and its central character is deliberately unlikeable, but smart writing and smarter performances shape this into something of an acerbic anti-Frasier.\\n\\nScott Pilgrim Takes Off\\n\\nAdapted from the beloved graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O\\'Malley, animated by one of the most exciting and dynamic studios in Japan, and voiced by the entire returning cast of director Edgar Wright\\'s 2010 live-action adaption, Scott Pilgrim Takes Off would have been cult gold even if it was a straight retelling of its eponymous slacker\\'s battles against lover Ramona Flowers\\' seven evil exes. Yet somehow, in a world devoid of surprises, this packs in killer twists from the very first episode, making for a show that\\'s as fresh and exciting as ever. Saying anything else would ruin it—just watch.\\n\\nPluto\\n\\nThink you know Astro Boy? Think again. In 2003, Naoki Urasawa (Monster, 20th Century Boys) updated original creator Osamu Tezuka\\'s hugely influential \"The Greatest Robot on Earth\" story arc for his manga Pluto, opting for a more adult approach. The focus shifts from the heroic boy robot to grizzled cybernetic detective Gesicht as he investigates a series of murders of both humans and robots, each victim left with makeshift horns crammed into their heads. Meanwhile, Atom (Astro\\'s Japanese name) is recast as a former peace ambassador, effectively a propaganda tool rolled out at the end of the 39th Central Asian War, still dealing with trauma from the experience. This adaptation is not only a faithful recreation of Urasawa\\'s retelling, but is stunningly animated to a standard rarely seen in Netflix\\'s original anime productions. With eight episodes, each around an hour long, this is as prestigious as any live-action thriller the streamer has produced, and a testament to both Tezuka and Urasawa\\'s respective geniuses.\\n\\nBlue Eye Samurai\\n\\nIn the 17th Century, Japan enforced its \"sakoku\" isolationist foreign policy, effectively closing itself off from the world. Foreigners were few and far between—so when Mizu (voiced by Maya Erskine) is born with blue eyes, nine months after her mother was assaulted by one of the four white men in the country, it marks her as an outsider, regarded as less than human. Years later, after being trained by a blind sword master and now masquerading as a man, Mizu hunts down those four men, knowing that killing them all is the only way to guarantee her vengeance. Exquisitely animated—which makes its unabashed violence all the more graphic—and with a phenomenal voice cast bolstered by the likes of George Takei, Brenda Song, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, and Kenneth Branagh, Blue Eye Samurai is one of the best adults-only animated series on Netflix.\\n\\nPending Train\\n\\nNetflix: License one of Japan’s best SF dramas in years. Also Netflix: Do nothing, literally nothing, to promote it, not even create an English subbed trailer. Which is where WIRED comes in—Pending Train is a show you (and Netflix) shouldn’t sleep on. When a train carriage is mysteriously transported into a post-apocalyptic future, the disparate passengers’ first concern is simply survival. Between exploring their new surroundings and clashing with people from another stranded train car over scarce resources, one group—including hairdresser Naoya, firefighter Yuto, and teacher Sae—begins to realize that there may be a reason they’ve been catapulted through time: a chance to go back and avert the disaster that ruined the world. A tense, 10-episode journey, Pending Train offers a Japanese twist on Lost, but one with tighter pacing and showrunners who actually have a clue where they want the story to go.\\n\\nOne Piece\\n\\nMark one up for persistence: After numerous anime adaptations ranging from “awful” to “not too bad,” Netflix finally strikes gold with its live-action take on the global phenomenon One Piece. Despite fans’ fears, this spectacularly captures the charm, optimism, and glorious weirdness of Eiichiro Oda’s beloved manga, manifesting a fantasy world where people brandish outlandish powers and hunt for a legendary treasure in an Age of Piracy almost verbatim from the page. The perfectly cast Iñaki Godoy stars as Monkey D. Luffy, would-be King of the Pirates, bringing an almost elastic innate physicality to the role that brilliantly matches the characters rubber-based stretching powers, while the crew Luffy gathers over this first season—including swordsmaster Roronoa Zoro (Mackenyu), navigator and skilled thief Nami (Emily Rudd), sharpshooter Usopp (Jacob Romero Gibson), and martial artist chef Sanji (Taz Skylar)—all brilliantly embody their characters. A lot could have gone wrong bringing One Piece to life, but this is a voyage well worth taking.\\n\\nThe Chosen One\\n\\nBased on the comic American Jesus by writer Mark Millar (Kick-Ass, Kingsman) and artist Peter Gross (Lucifer), The Chosen One follows 12-year-old Jodie (Bobby Luhnow), raised in Mexico by his mother Sarah (Dianna Agron). While the young boy would rather hang out with his friends, his life—and potentially the world—changes forever when he starts exhibiting miraculous powers, attracting dangerous attention from sinister forces. While this could have been yet another formulaic entry in Netflix\\'s expansive library of supernatural teen dramas (the Stranger Things vibe is particularly strong), the decision to shoot on film and in a 4:3 aspect ratio make this a visual delight, unlike almost anything else on the streamer at present. There\\'s an English dub, but stick to the original Spanish with English subs for a better viewing experience. (Confusingly, there\\'s another show with the exact same title on Netflix, a 2019 Brazilian series following a trio of relief doctors in a village dominated by a cult leader—also worth a watch, but don\\'t get them confused!)\\n\\nAlice in Borderland\\n\\nWhen slacker Ryohei Arisu (Kento Yamazaki) is mysteriously transported to a deserted Tokyo, his keen gaming skills give him an edge navigating a series of lethal games that test intellect as much as physical prowess. Yet after barely scraping through several rounds, Arisu is no closer to uncovering the secrets of this strange borderland, or to finding a way home—and the stakes are about to get even higher. Not only are Arisu and his allies Usagi (Tao Tsuchiya), Kuina (Aya Asahina), and Chishiya (Nijiro Murakami) faced with another gauntlet of sadistic games, but they find themselves caught between rival card suit “courts” vying for power—and not everyone can be trusted.\\n\\nWith its willingness to kill off main characters at a moment’s notice, the first season of this gripping adaptation of Haro Aso’s manga kept viewers on tenterhooks throughout. As the long-awaited second season leans further into its twisted Alice in Wonderland imagery, expect more shocking developments in this taut thriller.\\n\\nRussian Doll\\n\\nIn Russian Doll, Nadia has one very big problem: Time keeps breaking around her. Season one finds Nadia—played by Natasha Lyonne, who is also a cocreator on the show—dying at her own birthday party, only to wake up there over and over again, trapped in a Groundhog Day-style loop until she can unravel her personalized knot in the space-time continuum. Things only get stranger in season two, where Nadia finds herself traveling back in time to 1982 and inhabiting the body of her own mother—currently heavily pregnant with Nadia herself. Both seasons are funny and thought-provoking, reflecting on personal and generational trauma, all without overegging the potential for philosophical musing.\\n\\nLupin\\n\\nArsène Lupin, the belle epoque burglar created by French novelist Maurice Leblanc in the early 1900s, is reinvented as Assane Diop, a first-generation Frenchman with a mania for Lupin books and a grudge against the powerful forces who decades ago framed his father for a theft he didn’t commit—and led him to die in prison. Pairing drones, social media bots, and hacking skills with traditional tools of the trade like fake beards, picklocks, and quick wits, Diop hunts down his adversaries as he searches for the truth about his father’s fate. In his spare time, Diop also tries to patch together a crumbling marriage and build a better rapport with his son. Worth watching in the French original, this five-episode series’ strength lies in the dialog, the character development, and the charismatic performance of Omar Sy as Assane. The actual escapades and daring heists are beautifully choreographed, but a lot of the mechanics—how a certain piece of legerdemain worked, when an impenetrable building was infiltrated—are left to the viewer\\'s imagination.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'The first time that MBox ever went speeding around Times Square in New York City, he didn’t know it was going to change his life.\\n\\nHe had slipped into the car of his friend, a driver known online as Squeeze or Squeeze.benz, who MBox says was 21 years old—and set off for a drive in the early hours of the morning. The duo was armed with nothing but a camera, Squeeze’s BMW, and the shared desire to “go viral.”\\n\\nThe video they ended up filming that night shows them running red lights, narrowly avoiding scrapes with other cars, doing doughnuts at intersections, and even driving backward up a one-way street, all at high speeds. After being posted to YouTube last year, the footage was viewed more than 11 million times. It seemed their brand was on the rise—at least until the New York Police Department got involved.\\n\\nOn May 21, the department\\'s deputy commissioner of operations, Kaz Daughtry, proudly posted on X that the NYPD had “Squeeze.benz” in custody. Authorities cited his reckless driving, including outracing police. But when the NYPD charged Antonio Ginestri, 19 at the time and linked to the social media account in a New York Post report, the offense was third-degree assault, which law enforcement said stemmed from an unrelated incident several months prior. \"One of the most prolific street racers in NYC can no longer treat the Big Apple like the Indy 500,\" Daughtry claimed.\\n\\nThere’s just one problem: MBox swears that the NYPD implicated the wrong guy as Squeeze.\\n\\n“I don’t even want to get too much into that, but that was somebody else. They don’t have the real Squeeze,” MBox, an up-and-coming rapper in his mid-twenties who claims to be Squeeze’s “best friend” and interpreter, alleges to me via a Discord voice call. (MBox, like other YouTubers WIRED interviewed for this story, declined to give any identifying details.) “The real Squeeze is right next to me—he hasn’t been publicly identified.”\\n\\nIt would be easy to write this all off as bravado from a bunch of high-speed clout chasers, except for one thing: In September, more than three months after Ginestri’s arrest, while he was still in custody, a new video appeared on the Squeeze.Benz YouTube channel. It showed footage of several vehicles—one purportedly being driven by Squeeze—drifting and doing doughnuts in the center of Columbus Circle and Times Square, surrounded by pedestrians they narrowly missed hitting with their convoy of cars.\\n\\nIt is one of a barrage of clips uploaded to the channel, which has more than 735,000 subscribers and features video after video of high-speed, palm-sweat-inducing jaunts around New York City. Together, MBox and Squeeze have amassed an enormous fan base of car enthusiasts and adrenaline junkies—and set the scene for YouTube’s riskiest new niche: “swimmers” who weave through traffic at breakneck speeds.\\n\\nThe trend, partly driven by the lure of internet clout and social media fame, has become a focal point for the NYPD, who seem determined to stamp out the practice. Now, the drivers swear they have plans to go legit—before they get arrested, or worse.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\\n\\nCalculus is a powerful mathematical tool. But for hundreds of years after its invention in the 17th century, it stood on a shaky foundation. Its core concepts were rooted in intuition and informal arguments, rather than precise, formal definitions.\\n\\nTwo schools of thought emerged in response, according to Michael Barany, a historian of math and science at the University of Edinburgh. French mathematicians were by and large content to keep going. They were more concerned with applying calculus to problems in physics—using it to compute the trajectories of planets, for instance, or to study the behavior of electric currents. But by the 19th century, German mathematicians had begun to tear things down. They set out to find counterexamples that would undermine long-held assumptions, and eventually used those counterexamples to put calculus on more stable and durable footing.\\n\\nOne of these mathematicians was Karl Weierstrass. Though he showed an early aptitude for math, his father pressured him to study public finance and administration, with an eye toward joining the Prussian civil service. Bored with his university coursework, Weierstrass is said to have spent most of his time drinking and fencing; in the late 1830s, after failing to get his degree, he became a secondary school teacher, giving lessons in everything from math and physics to penmanship and gymnastics.\\n\\nWeierstrass didn’t begin his career as a professional mathematician until he was nearly 40. But he would go on to transform the field by introducing a mathematical monster.\\n\\nThe Pillars of Calculus\\n\\nIn 1872, Weierstrass published a function that threatened everything mathematicians thought they understood about calculus. He was met with indifference, anger, and fear, particularly from the mathematical giants of the French school of thought. Henri Poincaré condemned Weierstrass’ function as “an outrage against common sense.” Charles Hermite called it a “deplorable evil.”\\n\\nTo understand why Weierstrass’ result was so unnerving, it helps to first understand two of the most fundamental concepts in calculus: continuity and differentiability.\\n\\nA continuous function is exactly what it sounds like—a function that has no gaps or jumps. You can trace a path from any point on such a function to any other without lifting your pencil.\\n\\nCalculus is in large part about determining how quickly such continuous functions change. It works, loosely speaking, by approximating a given function with straight, nonvertical lines.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Listen and subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Pocket Casts\\n\\nThis episode, from our fourth season, called How to Talk to People, features host Julie Beck in conversation with hairstylists and self-described socially anxious people about how they overcome the barriers to starting conversations.\\n\\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\\n\\n[Music]\\n\\nMegan Garber: Hey, it’s Megan Garber, one of the co-hosts of How to Know What’s Real. We’re excited to share with you a special series drawn from past seasons of the How To series. For the last six weeks, we’ve been revisiting episodes around the theme of winding down. This episode is our last in this series and one of my personal favorites. It’s from season four, How to Talk to People, and is called “How to Make Small Talk.” Take a listen as former host Julie Beck and producer Becca Rashid talk with experts, from hairstylists to self-described socially anxious people, about how they work on letting go of social anxiety.\\n\\n[Music]\\n\\nMimi Craft: Okay, so we’ll sit here; we’ll start like usual and talk about what you want to do with your hair … because you need a haircut. (Laughs.)\\n\\nJulie Beck: Does this moment feel awkward to you?\\n\\nTy Tashiro: It doesn’t. So I don’t know if it should.\\n\\nBeck: Great news, great news.\\n\\nErin Derosa: If I’m in a five-minute conversation, I’m like, What am I gonna say next? What’s the next thing that I should … Did I already talk about the weather? I get real panicked.\\n\\nBeck: I feel like I can chat with anybody for, like, five minutes. Right? And then if I run out of things to say in the middle, that’s my fear—because we are trapped here for the duration of this haircut. I can’t just do it, like, “Well, it was so great to see you—got to run!” while you’re holding my hair.\\n\\nCraft: We could stop talking, and I will try to put out a comfortable, chill vibe.\\n\\nTashiro: It’s, you know, pretty common. Someone might say something like: “Oh, there’s a really good vibe here.” And to me that is totally bewildering, how they discern that vibe within a few seconds.\\n\\n[Music]\\n\\nBeck: Hi. I’m Julie Beck, a senior editor at The Atlantic.\\n\\nRebecca Rashid: And I’m Rebecca Rashid, producer of the How To series.\\n\\nBeck: This is How to Talk to People.\\n\\nBeck: Here at The Atlantic, I oversee the Family section, and I’ve also been reporting on friendship for many years now. So I think a lot about relationships and community.\\n\\nAnd I do see often that people struggle to find and form the close relationships that they really want. And I think one of the barriers to that is the dreaded small talk.\\n\\nRashid: So I think in this first episode, we have to figure out: How does one even make small talk? And what explains that tendency so many of us have to look down at our phones and avoid conversation, or hide in the corner at a party and only talk to the people we know? So where better to do some research on this than to talk to the ultimate small-talk experts: at the hair salon.\\n\\n[Music]\\n\\nBeck: I feel like, okay, the main thing that I need to ask you is: When I’m sitting in this chair, do you even want to talk to me?\\n\\nCraft: Oh, yeah.\\n\\nBeck: You can be honest. It wouldn’t hurt my feelings if you didn’t want to.\\n\\nCraft: I have to be here all day, so I do need some entertainment.\\n\\nBeck: Okay.\\n\\nCraft: So, I like talking to people. I like getting the hot goss.\\n\\nBeck: Okay.\\n\\nCraft: Yeah. Classic hairdresser situation.\\n\\nBeck: I mean, it feels rude, but in my mind I’ve also wondered: Would you actually be relieved if I was just on my phone the whole time, and then you could have a break from being “on” all the time?\\n\\nCraft: That is totally fine with me. Like, if you want to be on your phone, I do think of it that way. Okay, great, I’ll have a break. I’ll just, like, think about my own things that are going on, organize my brain. I’m just glad that you’re here. Most hairdressers are very much prepared to talk all day, I think. I don’t know. No?\\n\\nRashid: Julie, I can’t stop thinking about how much fun we had with Erin Derosa and Mimi Craft at Sense Salon in Washington, D.C.\\n\\nBeck: Yeah, I mean, they are the women who actually do my hair. And it was very fun to get, like, a peek behind the scenes of what they’re thinking the whole time.\\n\\nDerosa: I feel like if you want to talk, that’s amazing. It is really entertaining and fun to have a conversation and to have good conversation. But if you don’t want to talk, don’t try to talk. [Julie laughs.] Because then it’s really hard to have a conversation, and then it’s even more work to, like, keep it going and try to, like, fill the silence or whatever. And I’m very comfortable with silence and very comfortable just doing my thing and, you know, someone else doing their thing. But if you do want to have a conversation, that’s also always welcome.\\n\\n[Hair-dryer sound]\\n\\nRashid: I’m curious; what is it about small talk that makes you so nervous?\\n\\nBeck: Okay—to clarify, I don’t know that it makes me nervous all the time. I think what’s interesting about it is, it’s like you can’t really get around it. Like, any relationship that you’re going to have has to start with a conversation.\\n\\nSo it’s more a situation where I am trapped on the train with an acquaintance I don’t know that well, and we have 20 minutes to fill, and I’ve got five minutes of material … If I’m getting my hair cut or anywhere where you’re just trapped with either an acquaintance or a stranger for a long time and you have to kind of navigate: How much are we going to talk to each other? What are we going to talk about? Would they rather I just left them alone, but we’re both too polite to say so?\\n\\nI do get in my head a lot about that, and I find it very hard to relax sometimes if I am receiving a service. And probably if I was just normal and relaxed and enjoyed the situation, it would make them more comfortable. Like, I’m probably putting off a vibe.\\n\\nRashid: It can be extra challenging when the terms of that relationship are not really established in any way; like, just having a conversation with that person doesn’t necessarily mean you’re moving toward friendship.\\n\\nBeck: Yeah, you’re right. Like, the kind of people that are in your life, but that relationship is not necessarily going to grow from what it already is, but you still need to interact with them and perhaps semi-regularly. And just, like, how do you approach that—like, the barista you see every day? And you know that she knows that you always get the iced vanilla latte and she knows that you know that she knows, but you still just order it freshly every time.\\n\\nRashid: Yes. Yes.\\n\\nBeck: And you don’t ever acknowledge anything.\\n\\nBeck: Do you both consider yourself extroverts?\\n\\nDerosa/Craft: No. Oh, no, no, no. Hard no. Extreme no.\\n\\nBeck: Well, then, how do you sit here and make small talk all day, every day? Does it exhaust you?\\n\\nCraft: I once heard that introverts like to have a one-on-one, deeper conversations, whereas extroverts are more comfortable with typical small talk. I am not interested in small talk. I want to get right into the real talk immediately. And I definitely don’t want to go to, like, a party, honestly, basically ever, or be in a crowd where I have to make small talk with a lot of people, because that is exhausting to me. But having deep connections and one-on-one, deeper conversations with people is—I like that, and I’m good at it.\\n\\nBeck: Well, how do you define small talk, then?\\n\\nCraft: For me, small talk is like: “Oh, it’s cold out.” “Yeah, it’s cold out.” “Oh, do you like cold?” “No?” “Oh, yeah; me too.” And that’s really boring. “Oh, how was your weekend?” “Good.” “Oh, cool.” I want to know what happened.\\n\\nBeck: Well, are you coming in hot with your clients? Like, “Do you believe in God?”\\n\\nCraft: I mean, sometimes I’m coming in hot. Sometimes if I’m like, “Oh, how was your weekend?” “Great.” I will be like, “Did anything crazy happen? Did anybody go to the hospital?” Like, I want to get straight into it. If somebody was at a party, you can tell when somebody comes in on a Saturday morning and they were at a party the night before. And you really are like, “What happened last night? What went down?” I do like getting straight into the details.\\n\\nDerosa: I guess I’ll also say, like, I don’t come in: “Hey, how’s your hair? Do you believe in God?” It’s more like, somehow it’ll come up somewhere in the conversation. You know, you’ll be talking about their family or like their parents or whatever. And then it’s like, “Oh, how were you raised? Were you raised religiously?” It sort of evolves. And then I will say: “Well, do you believe in God?” (Laughter.)\\n\\nBeck: So that’s a real example that has happened?\\n\\nDerosa: Oh, yeah; for sure. For sure. But I like to have conversations like that with people. And that’s one of my favorite things about this job, is having real conversations like that.\\n\\nCraft: She gets the very most out of people because she is so genuinely curious that even if somebody maybe was not going into a conversation thinking they were going to reveal a detail, she will get it out of them because of her genuine curiosity.\\n\\nDerosa: Yeah, ’cause a lot of people are sort of in denial about what is happening in their situation. And because we’ve heard so many stories that are similar, and we are like: “No, like, this is what’s really happening.”\\n\\nCraft: We’re like, “Girl, no, this is what’s happening.” And then, like, come to find out maybe their next visit or their visit after that, they’re like, “That is what’s happening.” Because that is the value in good small talk and conversation; it’s that you learn from other people’s experiences. Everything repeats itself. Like, nothing’s really a new thing. So somebody comes in, and you’re like: I know what’s happening there.\\n\\n—\\n\\nBeck: I think small talk gets a lot of hate, but even if it’s a little boring, it serves a purpose. So those basic, neutral topics that people love to hate on, like “How’s the weather?” Like “Sure is a hot one out there”—those serve a purpose of being something neutral that can smooth the path of our interactions.\\n\\nRashid: But I think sometimes my producer brain wants to cut to the story, and I’m not always as delicate in the way I phrase my questions. And my intent is not to be offensive, but maybe just to connect with the person in the way I know best, or maybe be respectfully personal and try to bridge that gap.\\n\\nBeck: So your approach to small talk is to try to get personal as quickly as possible.\\n\\nRashid: Not uncomfortably so. But I struggle with the repeated “How’s the weather?” with someone I see every day. It’s like, Let’s move this conversation along. We’ve seen each other. We have some basic context of who each other is.\\n\\nBeck: I feel like I thrive on that surface level. Just the sort of Seinfeldian, observational comedy of, like, these are things that are happening around us that I can remark upon and do a little bit with you and then, like, tip my hat and walk away. Once we transition to something that is a little more personal, that is where I feel like a little bumpy. In our conversation with Erin and Mimi, it really wasn’t that awkward, surface-level kind of small talk that I think people fear.\\n\\nRashid: Right, and it seems like they were really naturally cognizant of people’s different comfort levels and what would be an appropriate story to share, and they were sort of able to read the room and read the space of the conversation and, you know, they’re experts at this. They do this every day.\\n\\nBeck: Yeah, reading the room is a skill for sure, and I think for those of us who aren’t quite so practiced as they are, I want to understand more so what can cause a seemingly innocuous conversation to take a turn for the awkward, and how we navigate it when that happens and what the barriers are to getting out of our own heads and just chatting.\\n\\n[Music]\\n\\nRashid: Ty Tashiro is a social scientist who writes about awkwardness, and his book called Awkward: The Science of Why We’re Socially Awkward and Why That’s Awesome explores a lot of these social and behavioral trends specific to adults in the United States. And he helps people think through how to be in social spaces and be in social spaces and feel just a bit more confident.\\n\\n[Music]\\n\\nTy Tashiro: One of the great things about studying awkwardness is that everybody has had an awkward moment. For example, you’re giving a presentation, and you have an undone zipper. That’s super awkward, super embarrassing, but it’s actually not that big of a deal. It’s just an uncomfortable deviation from actually a small social expectation. If you had spinach in your teeth during a first date, same thing. It’s actually a really small kind of social expectation, but we have this really powerful emotional reaction to it.\\n\\nSome of my close friends had moved to new cities and I would go visit them, and we’d go out to parties or go to a bar or something. And some of these friends were awkward. And, you know, I’d watch them in these social interactions meeting new people, and it was just heartbreaking. Because they would be their regular awkward self. And you could see the other folks losing interest and saying “I gotta go get another drink” or something.\\n\\nJust that sad sort of excusing themselves for no good reason. And I thought to myself, like, Well, this is heartbreaking for my friend who’s trying to make new acquaintances or new friends in the city, but I thought, It’s also too bad for the other person because here’s this awkward person who has tremendous moral character, who’s super interesting, who’s been an amazing friend to me, but they ruled out any chance of future social interaction based on three or four minutes of chitchat. And so I had this thought, like, If the awkward person could skip the first five minutes of a social interaction, I actually think they’d be all right.\\n\\nBeck: What exactly was it that your friend was doing that made people want to leave and go get another drink? What was so awkward about it?\\n\\nTashiro: This friend was, is, still, a space invader. So, in the U. S., the typical amount of space you give someone is about 18 inches.\\n\\nBeck: Oh, I thought you meant like the video game. Okay.\\n\\nTashiro: Oh, no. Yeah, yeah. No, not that old-school. But he’s a space invader. So he’s probably about 10 inches, which is way too close. And that makes people feel uncomfortable. He also has trouble with voice modulation, which can certainly happen with awkward people. Speaks a little bit too loud, probably, for other people’s comfort. You know, I guess when you take a step back from it, my thought is, you know, Who cares? Like, if you can get past those little clumsy moments at the start, you find this really wonderful person.\\n\\nSo I wanted to see—are there ways that the awkward person can navigate those awkward moments a little bit more smoothly? On the other hand, for people who aren’t awkward, can they have a little more empathy for the awkward person’s situation?\\n\\nBeck: So in your book you write that some people are more prone to awkwardness than others. Where do you think you fall?\\n\\nTashiro: Oh, boy. I’m pretty awkward. When I was a kid, I was very awkward. And I think in adulthood, I can pass for socially fluent in most situations. But I certainly still have my moments.\\n\\nBeck: You’re doing great. I’m curious, can you just walk me through what goes through your mind when you, say, enter a party where you only know one or two people? What is the strategy that runs through your mind at that time?\\n\\nTashiro: So, you know, before the social event occurs, I do get some social anxiety. I think maybe the difference for someone who’s awkward is that these feelings of anxiety aren’t irrational. So I’ll give more thought to small details, like, What am I going to wear? What would be an appropriate thing to bring? What time am I gonna get there?\\n\\nAnd so I just have a little self-talk before I go into these situations. I call it my mental preparation, and I’ll just say, Hey, you don’t know anybody; you’re nervous about that. And that’s okay. You’ve been in these situations before, and you can do it. But I need to have a more assertive attitude than would be natural for me. When I get there, there’s kind of this funny thing that happens.\\n\\nSo let’s say we walk into the party, and it’s in full swing. It’s pretty common; someone might say something like, “Oh, there’s a really good vibe here.” And to me, that is totally bewildering how they discern that vibe within a few seconds.\\n\\nSo awkward people, when they enter a social situation, they’re not all at once kind of evaluating what’s going on. Instead, what they’re doing is looking at individual pieces of information and then kind of putting it together, almost like a puzzle, to figure out what the situation is like, and how they should behave.\\n\\nSo it takes longer for me to read the room, I guess, and then feel comfortable enough to get in there and interact smoothly with other people. And then when I get into it, I just try to be honest, actually. And so I would approach people—if you had the uncomfortable situation where you’ve talked to somebody and they’ve moved on to something else, and you’re standing there by yourself—I’ll just approach a group, and I’ll say, “Hey, I’m Ty. I’m new here. Do you mind if I join you?” And that might sound a little daunting to some folks, but I always find that people are really receptive to that. It took a little bit of boldness, maybe, to say something like that, and I think people appreciate that.\\n\\nBeck: So why do people feel awkward in that awkward moment where they’ve broken one minor expectation? Is it the same thing as social anxiety, or is it a unique feeling?\\n\\nTashiro: So, social anxiety is more of a forward-looking kind of emotion. So when we feel social anxiety, the core of that is we have some irrational fear that we’re going to mess up, or we’re going to make a fool of ourselves in a social situation.\\n\\nWith awkwardness, it’s more of this just in-the-moment, very present kind of feeling. And it even comes along with things like a racing heart, or your muscles might tense. Of course, one of the hallmarks is that you might blush, right? And people usually feel horrible about that. They think, I’ve just made this awkward moment worse by blushing.\\n\\nSo blushing actually sends a signal: Hey, I just did something awkward. I feel bad about that, and I’m blushing. I’m sending you this social signal. And people actually really appreciate that. And actually just being honest about the awkward moment that just took place can actually be beneficial for building some trust with another person.\\n\\nBeck: So do you think that you’ve gotten more comfortable with socializing over time, or do you just feel like you’ve learned strategies?\\n\\nTashiro: I think it’s that I’ve learned strategies first, and then the social comfort came after that. So let me give you a quick example, maybe from childhood, about some of these strategies I had to learn.\\n\\nSo when we would go to Wendy’s to get a hamburger, my parents would park the car. And they would turn around, and they’d say, “Ty, it’s time to mentally prepare.” And I would shake my head: Yes. I knew exactly what this meant.\\n\\nAnd what it was was this kind of Socratic dialogue where they would ask me a series of questions. And it would help me prepare for what the expectations would be in the social situation, and also help me think about what I needed to do with my social behaviors to handle it well and appropriately.\\n\\nSo they’d say things like, “Well, where are we?” And I’d say, “Well, we’re at Wendy’s!” And “What’s the first thing you need to look for when you step inside the door?”\\n\\nAnd I would say, “Well, I need to look and see if there’s a line.” And that’s because sometimes I would go in and just shoot straight to the front, and not because I was trying to cut or cheat.\\n\\nAnd this is hard for some non-awkward people to believe, but because I didn’t see the line, or it didn’t register with me. I was so narrowly focused on the hamburger and the fries that I would just not see all of the social information off to the side.\\n\\nSo once I was in line, you know, I need to figure out what to order; I need to look the cashier in the eye, say please, say thank you, not whip around on my tray and spill my drink all over the people behind me like I had done a couple times previously.\\n\\nSo this would happen not just once. This would happen dozens of times for various kinds of social situations. And my folks would need me to get into the habit of thinking about, Hey, what’s the goal in this situation? What are the small expectations you’re going to encounter? And then, what are the behaviors that you need to execute to be socially fluent in the situation?\\n\\nSo I think with, you know, most kids you could say, “Hey, make sure you’re polite when you’re ordering” or something like that, and they would think of all the little behaviors that go into that. But for the awkward kid, that’s not intuitive. And so you just need to break it down into component parts. I mean, if you walked with me into a Wendy’s now, I’m pretty smooth. (Julie laughs.)\\n\\n[Music]\\n\\nCraft: Like, I didn’t always know how to get into a conversation and connect with somebody. I just learned it when I started doing hair. And for people who don’t really know how to do it, I kind of was thinking, Is there a go-to question, or something? But it really depends on the setting.\\n\\nBeck: So do you actually want to or feel comfortable talking about yourself with clients? Or do you actively, like, keep the focus on them in their stories, because you maybe don’t want to share?\\n\\nCraft: I feel comfortable. I will share anything. Sometimes I feel like I don’t have anything that interesting to share, and so then I don’t want to talk about myself, because, like, “Oh, are you taking vacations?” “No.” “Okay, cool.” A lot of people, really—that is their No. 1 personal question: “Do you have any trips planned?”\\n\\nBeck: Oh, I’m very guilty of that. Because it’s like, it’s not too personal. But maybe it gives us something to talk about.\\n\\nDerosa: That is my conversation filler when I have pretty much nothing left. I say, “Do you have any trips planned?” Because we gotta, like, drum something up here.\\n\\nCraft: It could really go somewhere, where you’re talking about a trip and like fun things, but the potential for a dead end is high.\\n\\nBeck: That’s how you know you’re scraping the bottom of the barrel, I guess.\\n\\nCraft: Sort of like talking about the weather, you know?\\n\\nBeck: I’m going to be self-conscious about that question from now on.\\n\\nCraft: Sorry, I did not mean to make you feel that way.\\n\\nBeck: No, no, no, it’s good. But that does remind me of something I wanted to ask too, because I feel like a lot of what we’ve been talking about is, like, ways that the small talk manifests very uniquely to your job. And so, how much do you feel like the skills that y’all have here translate into the real world versus what is pretty specific to, like, this interaction and this relationship?\\n\\nCraft: I feel like it translates exactly the same, like, immediately.\\n\\nDerosa: I think you’re really good at that. I struggle with that. Because sometimes being in the hair salon, I’m really in my comfort zone in this weird way, and I’ll see the same person at the coffee shop or something and I sort of stumble on my words and I get sort of stumped. I get a little awkward and I think that’s more of my—I get some social anxiety going on if it’s people I don’t know. And this goes back to your introvert-versus-extrovert question. If it’s people I don’t know, I can do that small-talk thing to an extent, but then I can’t go all the way ’cause it’s a bigger setting. There’s more people. I’m really good in that sort of one-on-one moment.\\n\\nCraft: Like, even the hair salon, it really is, I think, a safe space in the community, because who am I going to tell? I’m not so invested that telling me is going to have, like any major impact in their personal life. So they can get things off their chest and feel safe; that it’s not, like, a risk.\\n\\nDerosa: And I do agree, if you’re not having those relationships in your community, you are missing out on just, like, It’s personal, but it’s casual.\\n\\nBeck: Yeah. I don’t know how we get to a place where we just accept that feeling awkward won’t kill us. But I’m not there yet.\\n\\n[Music]\\n\\nRashid: I’m curious if part of the stress, too, is that once you start a conversation with someone—and if you do start to feel awkward, and maybe you’re not comfortable being honest right away about the fact that you’re feeling awkward—and you want to dip out of the conversation, it can be hard to do that.\\n\\nBeck: For me, a situation that can cause some anxiety is if I am trapped with, say, like, an acquaintance on a train, and maybe that train ride is half an hour long, and what are we going to do? And I would love to tell you about a man that I once knew, an acquaintance of mine from college, who I truly would not remember at all were it not for this moment.\\n\\nHe was a friend of a friend. And one day we were both on the same train going down to Chicago together. I went to school outside of Chicago, and so this was like a good 40-, 45-minute train ride. And he pulled the most, like, amazing Uno-reverse ninja trick I’ve ever seen in conversation.\\n\\nAnd so we did the very classic, like: “Hey, how’s it going? How’s the one thing that I know about you?” “It’s still good. How’s the one thing that I know about you?” “It’s fine.” And then we ran out of material. And he just said: “It’s been so great talking to you. I’m going to go read my book now.” And then we both sat down on opposite sides of the train, and we read our books, and we took that half-hour train ride down to Chicago. And when I got off the train, we did like a friendly wave.\\n\\nAnd I actually don’t think we ever saw each other again. But I’ve thought about this man so regularly for the past, like, 10 years, because he just handled that interaction in such a smooth way that you almost never see.\\n\\nTashiro: I think we feel kind of more awkward than ever about these kinds of things: meeting new people, or the conversation in the elevator. It seems to stop people.\\n\\nBeck: Why do you say you think that we’re more fearful of awkwardness than we used to be?\\n\\nTashiro: I think maybe some of it has to do with the fact that we don’t have to interact with people as much as we used to. We can do it through our social media, or we can get absorbed in our phones or stay in the comfort of our home and stream some show.\\n\\nThere’s all these outs from, you know, actually being face-to-face with people and going through those uncomfortable moments of trying to get to know somebody for the first time or dealing with the prospect that they might reject us, that maybe they don’t want to hang out. And that’s a scary thing as well. So I think there’s these alternatives about how we can spend our time that are kind of semi-social or faux social, but I think that’s actually damaging, because it keeps us from doing the hard work of getting face-to-face and actually working to build a friendship.\\n\\nBeck: What do you mean by semi-social, faux social?\\n\\nTashiro: Well, you know, if you’re texting back and forth with somebody, that’s fine. But it’s obviously not as good, right, as sitting down with them for a long dinner and getting into just a deep conversation. And same thing with social media: We’ve kind of put our best foot forward on social media and we might have some nice interactions, but they’re not as gratifying as a face-to-face interaction with somebody.\\n\\nBeck: Is the texting and the faux social interactions to some degree maybe our way of preparing to go to Wendy’s?\\n\\nTashiro: Yeah, definitely. That’s a good point. In online dating, for example, you might send messages back and forth or whatever. And that kind of gives you a sense of the person; gets the interaction rolling a little bit before you actually meet up. When all you really want to do is get face-to-face and figure out if there might be some kind of chemistry here, but even in platonic situations, it’s the same thing. We can get stuck mentally preparing for something that should have happened a long time ago.\\n\\nBeck: Yeah, well one consequence of this fear of awkwardness is people go to parties, or they go to bars, and they only talk to people they already know. Have you noticed that in your life?\\n\\nTashiro: Oh, for sure. You know, it’s another thing, kind of, that makes me just want to go over and say things I have no business saying to other people.\\n\\nBeck: Like what?\\n\\nTashiro: I just want to say, like, “Go meet other people. You know, you’re standing here in your group of three you came in with, and you look semi-sad. Go talk to these other people you want to talk to.”\\n\\nBeck: So how can we break out of that? Do we really need to break out of that, or is it fine to just embrace the safety of hanging out with my existing friends at a party?\\n\\nTashiro: My bias would be: I don’t think that’s okay. You know, there’s all this disconnection going on. So the average person could benefit from more friends, and certainly benefit from more friends that they’ve built some quality intimacy with and they feel they can go to in a time of need.\\n\\nSo if we go with that perspective, then we should break out of our shell, and we should cross that junior-high dance floor of sorts and go talk to somebody new—knowing that this person might reject us, or knowing that the interaction might be a little bit awkward. But that’s okay.\\n\\n[Music]\\n\\nBeck: I mean, to some degree it’s a justified fear, right? Like, you probably will feel awkward. Like, you actually aren’t going to make it through this life without being awkward in social situations.\\n\\nBut I think, like, Ty made me realize that part of what makes things so awkward sometimes is trying to pretend that they’re not. Like, all of his advice would boil down to: Just be honest.\\n\\nLike, just go up to those people that you don’t know at the party and say, “I don’t know anyone at the party. Can I hang out with you?” And like, I would never in a million years have thought to say that to somebody. Like, I would probably try to be nonchalant by the punch bowl and, like, sidle my way into a conversation and hope it was just cool and nobody noticed that I didn’t really belong there. You know?\\n\\nSome of what is really challenging about small talk is: It’s so situational. Small talk with someone you admire on a train is different than small talk on a first date. And then there’s also each individual person’s reactions, and whether they want to be left alone, and how open they are to conversation. And how awkward you feel, and how awkward they feel.\\n\\nBut I think there can be a middle path where you read the room a bit. Maybe you have some questions in your back pocket, and you know, there’s certainly times where I leave my headphones in and I’m looking at my phone and I don’t really want to be spoken to either, but I think we have to bear in mind what we miss out on if we do that all the time.\\n\\nRashid: Yes. And I think that’s exactly what I wonder—if what gets lost is all of us getting used to not trying to start up a conversation with anyone. Out of fear, or out of fear that it won’t lead anywhere, or it doesn’t mean anything.\\n\\nBeck: Yeah. I remember Mimi and Erin talking a lot about how fueled they actually are by all the conversations that they have at work. And, like, not just purely for entertainment value, but also like feeling like these conversations are meaningful, and they are bringing something unique and special into their lives. They were just interested in people. And just, like, having a genuine curiosity for the person that’s in front of you fuels conversation.\\n\\nRashid: As meta as that is, we got to talk about it. (Laughs.)\\n\\nBeck: On that note, Becca, it’s been so great making a podcast with you. And I’m going to go read my book now.\\n\\n[Music]\\n\\nRashid: That’s all for this week’s episode of How to Talk to People. This episode was produced by me, Rebecca Rashid, and hosted by Julie Beck.

       "   'content': '“To a true collector,” the German philosopher Walter Benjamin noted in his 1931 essay “Unpacking My Library,” “the acquisition of an old book is its rebirth.” This is an apt way to describe the many lives a single volume may live. On its initial printing, it may receive a flurry of attention from readers and reviewers—or none at all. Some titles go straight from best seller to well-loved classic, with no dip in demand; others, though popular in their author’s lifetime, may quickly fade into obscurity.\\n\\nAnd then there are the “rebirths” Benjamin described: the second acts, rediscoveries, and renewals that bring older works back into circulation. Happily, unfairly forgotten treasures are in vogue. Major publishers and small presses are reissuing novels long out of print, exhuming unpublished manuscripts from celebrated writers, and championing unpopular works dismissed for their abstraction or difficulty. Reading can offer the delightful opportunity to find your present-day thoughts, worries, and emotions in a book published before you were even born. These books may also change how you think about the past, or feature prose you’d never encounter in contemporary life. The following titles are only a small selection that have, in recent years, through the efforts of obsessive editors and fans alike, found themselves justifiably rescued from oblivion.\\n\\nThe Maimed, by Hermann Ungar, translated by Kevin Blahut\\n\\n“A sexual hell” is how the German writer Thomas Mann apparently referred to Ungar’s debut novel, The Maimed, first published in German in 1923. The tense, terse novel follows a hapless bank clerk, Franz Polzer, as he finds himself drawn into a sadomasochistic affair with his landlady. The Maimed brings Franz Kafka’s work to mind, but it is more sexually explicit on the page and made all the more claustrophobic by the introduction of Karl—a childhood friend of Polzer’s who may or may not have been his lover, and who is dying of an unnamed degenerative disease. As Polzer’s affair turns more and more violent, a murder occurs, as well as a mystery: Who is responsible for the killing? With its swirl of erotic anxiety and its ambiguous ending, The Maimed heralded the beginning of a promising literary career that, like Kafka’s, was cut short when Ungar died in his prime, in 1929, at age 36.\\n\\nThe Maimed By Hermann Ungar\\n\\nFish Tales, by Nettie Jones\\n\\n“You’re not crazy to me,” one character tells the narrator of Fish Tales, a 30-something Black woman named Lewis Jones. “You’re daring. Most people cannot even imagine life the way you live it.” That life includes nights out on the town in 1970s Detroit and disco-fueled Manhattan, copious amounts of cocaine, and sexual encounters both outlandish and, at times, demoralizing. This frenetic novel, first acquired by Toni Morrison and published in 1983, has become something of a cult classic, and it’s easy to understand why: It approaches relationships with raw and unvarnished honesty. A new edition forthcoming from Farrar, Straus and Giroux in April promises to bring additional audiences to Jones’s sharp, fast-paced look at the highs and lows of the human heart.\\n\\nFish Tales By Nettie Jones\\n\\nI Who Have Never Known Men, by Jacqueline Harpman, translated by Ros Schwartz\\n\\nFirst published in 1995 and recently reissued by the Bay Area–based small press Transit Books, the science-fiction novel I Who Have Never Known Men, written by a Belgian psychoanalyst, has received a surprising amount of attention on social media. BookTok contains hundreds of videos of readers discovering and discussing Harpman’s haunting feminist dystopia. Told from the perspective of its young and nameless female narrator, the book follows a group of 39 women of various ages who spend their days imprisoned in an underground bunker, which is patrolled by a mysterious series of male guards. After an accident sets the women free, our protagonist finds herself suddenly wandering through a wasteland and learning, from the other women, about the world as it existed before the vault, which she has no memory of. Together, they reconstruct elements of society: devising a system of time-telling through counts of the human heartbeat, rediscovering the existence of organized religion. What stands out most is the philosophical approach Harpman takes as she renders the familiar strange.\\n\\nThe Long-Winded Lady: Notes From The New Yorker, by Maeve Brennan\\n\\nThe woman wandering the city alone has become something of a popular, even glamorous, figure. She’s a variation on the 19th century’s flaneur, seen in contemporary works such as Olivia Laing’s 2016 memoir, The Lonely City, as well as reissued novels such as Elizabeth Hardwick’s Sleepless Nights, from 1979, and Ursula Parrott’s Ex-Wife, from 50 years before that. The characters in those books would find common cause with the Irish writer Maeve Brennan, who from 1954 to 1981 wrote missives for The New Yorker under the pen name “The Long-Winded Lady,” a woman who witnessed all kinds of behavior from New York’s denizens at all hours of the day. The columns in this collection, first collected in 1969 and reprinted in 2016, depict, in finely rendered strokes, the minutiae of close-quarters living. “There were no seats to be had on the A train last night,” one begins; still another starts in a bookstore and veers off, at the end, into a meditation on Balzac’s favorite food (sardine paste, apparently). At a moment when the atomization of interpersonal relationships is at the forefront of public discussion, Brennan’s winsome, melancholy-streaked portraits of city life hold particular resonance.\\n\\nMr. Dudron, by Giorgio de Chirico, translated by Stefania Heim\\n\\nThe relationship between the artist and their audience has been analyzed and fetishized by critics ad nauseam, but Mr. Dudron provides a fresh perspective from the artist’s point of view. This previously unpublished novel by the Greek-born Italian painter de Chirico, written fitfully over decades, doesn’t have much of a plot, instead unfurling as a series of anecdotal conversations among artists and meandering, essayistic theories of painting. In lieu of a digestible arc, the reader gets a peek inside the head of de Chirico, whose off-kilter paintings of empty city squares in the early 20th century would go on to strongly influence the Surrealists. “A work of art should never force the viewer nor the maker into an act of reasoning, or criticism, or exposition,” de Chirico writes, per one early translation; instead, “it should provoke only satisfaction … that is, a condition in which reasoning no longer exists.”\\n\\nMr. Dudron By Giorgio de Chirico\\n\\nTwilight Sleep, by Edith Wharton\\n\\n“Mrs. Wharton,” reads a line in The Atlantic’s review of her 1927 novel, Twilight Sleep, “has never really descended from that plane of excellence which since its beginning has characterized her work.” Implicit in this observation: until now. Although contemporary reviewers might not have appreciated Twilight Sleep as much as they did Wharton’s previous books, her 17th novel offers an updated, Jazz Age–variation on a familiar, Wharton-esque theme: social ruin. In Roaring ’20s New York, Pauline Manford, the book’s heroine, inoculates herself from life’s unpleasantries—including her second husband’s affair with his stepson’s wife, Lita—with a busy social calendar, but when disaster strikes and the affair is discovered, not even Pauline’s unblinking devotion to rationality, truth, and progress can soothe her emotional reaction. Named after the drug cocktail given to women in the 20th century to ward off the pains of childbirth, which brings to mind the anesthetized attitude of some of its characters, Twilight Sleep was republished in late 2024.\\n\\nTwilight Sleep By Edith Wharton'},\n",

       "   'content': 'A Mississippian who early established herself as one of the abler writers of her generation, Eudora Welty has contributed many fine things to the Atlantic, including her stories “A Worn Path,” “Powerhouse,” and “Why I Live at the P.O.,” and her short novel Delta Wedding.\\n\\nEditor’s Note: A Mississippian who early established herself as one of the abler writers of her generation, Eudora Welty has contributed many fine things to the Atlantic, including her stories “A Worn Path,” “Powerhouse,” and “Why I Live at the P.O.,” and her short novel Delta Wedding.\\n\\nNOT too long ago I read in some respectable press that Faulkner would have to be reassessed because he was “after all, only a white Mississippian.” For this reason, it was felt, readers could no longer rely on him for knowing what he was writing about in his life’s work of novels and stories, laid in what he called “my country.”\\n\\nRemembering how Faulkner for most of his life wrote in all but isolation from critical understanding, ignored impartially by North and South, with only a handful of critics in forty years who were able to “assess” him, we might smile at this journalist as at a boy let out of school. Or there may have been an instinct to smash the superior, the good, that is endurable enough to go on offering itself. But I feel in these words and others like them the agonizing of our times. I think they come of an honest and understandable zeal to allot every writer his chance to better the world or go to his grave reproached for the mess it is in. And here, it seems to me, the heart of fiction’s real reliability has been struck at — and not for the first time by the noble hand of the crusader.\\n\\nIt would not be surprising if the critic I quote had gained his knowledge of the South from the books of the author he repudiates. At any rate, a reply to him exists there. Full evidence as to whether any writer, alive or dead, can be believed is always at hand in one place: any page of his work. The color of his skin would modify it just about as much as would the binding of his book. Integrity can be neither lost nor concealed nor faked nor quenched nor artificially come by nor outlived, nor, I believe, in the long run denied. Integrity is no greater and no less today than it was yesterday and will be tomorrow. It stands outside time.\\n\\nThe novelist and the crusader who writes both have their own place — in the novel and the editorial respectively, equally valid whether or not the two happen to be in agreement. In my own view, writing fiction places the novelist and the crusader on opposite sides. But they are not the sides of right and wrong. Honesty is not at stake here and is not questioned; the only thing at stake is the proper use of words for the proper ends. And a mighty thing it is.\\n\\nBecause the printed page is where the writer’s work is to be seen, it may be natural for people who do not normally read fiction to confuse novels with journalism or speeches. The very using of words has these well-intentioned people confused about the novelist’s purpose.\\n\\nThe writing of a novel is taking life as it already exists, not to report it but to make an object, toward the end that the finished work might contain this life inside it, and offer it to the reader. The essence will not be, of course, the same thing as the raw material; it is not even of the same family of things. The novel is something that never was before and will not be again. For the mind of one person, its writer, is in it too. What distinguishes it above all from the raw material, and what distinguishes it from journalism, is that inherent in the novel is the possibility of a shared act of the imagination between its writer and its reader.\\n\\n“All right, Eudora Welty, what are you going to do about it? Sit down there with your mouth shut?”, asked a stranger over long distance in one of the midnight calls that I suppose have waked most writers in the South from time to time. It is part of the same question, Are fiction writers on call to be crusaders? For us in the South who are fiction writers, is writing a novel something we can do about it?\\n\\nIT CAN be said at once, I should think, that we are all agreed upon the most important point: that morality as shown through human relationships is the whole heart of fiction, and the serious writer has never lived who dealt with anything else.\\n\\nAnd yet, the zeal to reform, which quite properly inspires the editorial, has never done fiction much good. The exception occurs when it can rise to the intensity of satire, where it finds a better home in the poem or the drama. Large helpings of naïveté and self-esteem, which serve to refresh the crusader, only encumber the novelist. How unfair it is that when a novel is to be written, it is never enough to have our hearts in the right place! But goodwill all by itself can no more get a good novel written than it can paint in watercolor or sing Mozart.\\n\\nNevertheless, let us suppose that we feel we might help if we were to write a crusading novel. What will our problems be?\\n\\nBefore anything else, speed. The crusader’s message is prompted by crisis; it has to be delivered on time. Suppose John Steinbeck had only now finished The Grapes of Wrath? The ordinary novelist has only one message: “I submit that this is one way we are.” This can wait. When we think of Ibsen, we see that causes themselves may in time be forgotten, their championship no longer needed; it is Ibsen’s passion that keeps the plays alive.\\n\\nNext, we as the crusader-novelist shall find awkward to use the very weapon we count on most: the generality. On fiction’s pages, generalities clank when wielded, and hit with equal force at the little and the big, at the merely suspect and the really dangerous. They make too much noise for us to hear what people might be trying to say. They are fatal to tenderness and are in themselves nonconductors of any real, however modest, discovery of the writer’s own heart. This discovery is the best hope of the ordinary novelist, and to make it he begins not with the generality but with the particular in front of his eyes, which he is able to examine.\\n\\nTaking a particular situation existing in his world, and what he feels about it in his own breast and what he can make of it in his own head, he constructs on paper, little by little, an equivalent of it. Literally it may correspond to a high degree or to none at all; emotionally it corresponds as closely as he can make it. Observation and the inner truth of that observation as he perceives it, the two being tested one against the other: to him this is what the writing of a novel is.\\n\\nWe, the crusader-novelist, having started with our generality, must end with a generality; they had better be the same. In the place of climax, we can deliver a judgment. How can the plot seem disappointing when it is a lovely argument spread out? It is because fiction is stone-deaf to argument.\\n\\nThe ordinary novelist does not argue; he hopes to show, to disclose. His persuasions are all toward allowing his reader to see and hear something for himself. He knows another bad thing about arguments: they carry the menace of neatness into fiction. Indeed, what we as the crusader-novelist are scared of most is confusion.\\n\\nGreat fiction, we very much fear, abounds in what makes for confusion; it generates it, being on a scale which copies life, which it confronts. It is very seldom neat, is given to sprawling and escaping from bounds, is capable of contradicting itself, and is not impervious to humor. There is absolutely everything in great fiction but a clear answer. Humanity itself seems to matter more to the novelist than what humanity thinks it can prove.\\n\\nWhen a novelist writes of man’s experience, what else is he to draw on but the life around him? And yet the life around him, on the surface, can be used to show anything, absolutely anything, as readers know. The novelist’s real task and real responsibility lie in the way he uses it.\\n\\nSituation itself always exists; it is whatever life is up to here and now, it is the living and present moment. It is transient, and it fluctuates. Using the situation, the writer populates his novel with characters invented to express it in their terms.\\n\\nIt is important that it be in their terms. We cannot in fiction set people to acting mechanically or carrying placards to make their sentiments plain. People are not Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, Black and White personified; flesh and blood and the sense of comedy object. Fiction writers cannot be tempted to make the mistake of looking at people in the generality — that is to say, of seeing people as not at all like us. If human beings are to be comprehended as real, then they have to be treated as real, with minds, hearts, memories, habits, hopes, with passions and capacities like ours. This is why novelists begin the study of people from within.\\n\\nThe first act of insight is to throw away the labels. In fiction, while we do not necessarily write about ourselves, we write out of ourselves, using ourselves; what we learn from, what we are sensitive to, what we feel strongly about — these become our characters and go to make our plots. Characters in fiction are conceived from within, and they have, accordingly, their own interior life; they are individuals every time. The character we care about in a novel we may not approve of or agree with — that’s beside the point. But he has got to seem alive. Then and only then, when we read, we experience or surmise things about life itself that are deeper and more lasting and less destructive to understanding than approval or disapproval.\\n\\nTHE novelist’s work is highly organized, but I should say it is organized around anything but logic. Just as characters are not labels but are made from the inside out and grow into their own life, so does a plot have a living principle on which it hangs together and gradually earns its shape. A plot is a thousand times more unsettling than an argument, which may be answered. It is not a pattern imposed; it is inward emotion acted out. It is arbitrary, indeed, but not artificial. It is possibly so odd that it might be called a vision, but it is organic to its material: it is a working vision, then.\\n\\nA writer works through what is around him if he wishes to get to what he is after — no kind of proof, but simply an essence. In practice he will do anything at all with his material: shape it, strain it to the breaking point, double it up, or use it backwards; he will balk at nothing — see The Sound and the Fury — to reach that heart and core. But even in a good cause he does not falsify it. The material itself receives deep ultimate respect: it has given rise to the vision of it, which in turn has determined what the novel shall be.\\n\\nThe ordinary novelist, who can never make a perfect thing, can with every novel try again. But if we write a novel to prove something, one novel will settle it, for why prove a thing more than once? And what then is to keep all novels by all right-thinking persons from being pretty much alike? Or exactly alike? There would be little reason for present writers to keep on, no reason for the new writers to start. There’s no way to know, but we might guess that the reason the young write no fiction behind the Iron Curtain is the obvious fact that to be acceptable there, all novels must conform, and so must be alike, hence valueless. If the personal vision can be made to order, then we should lose, writer and reader alike, our own gift for perceiving, seeing through the fabric of everyday to what to each pair of eyes on earth is a unique thing. We’d accept life exactly like everybody else, and so, of course, be content with it. We should not even miss our vanished novelists. And if life ever became not worth writing fiction about, that, I believe, would be the first sign that it wasn’t worth living.\\n\\nWith a blueprint to work with instead of a vision, there is a good deal that we as the crusader-novelist must be at pains to leave out. Unavoidably, I think, we shall leave out one of the greatest things. This is the mystery in life. Our blueprint for sanity and of solution for trouble leaves out the dark. (This is odd, because surely it was the dark that first troubled us.) We leave out the wonder because with wonder it is impossible to argue, much less to settle. The ordinary novelist thinks it had better be recognized. Reckless as this may make him, he believes the insoluble is part of his material too.\\n\\nThe novelist works neither to correct nor to condone, not at all to comfort, but to make what’s told alive. He assumes at the start an enlightenment in his reader equal to his own, for they are hopefully on the point of taking off together from that base into the rather different world of the imagination.\\n\\nIt’s not only the fact that this world is bigger and that fewer constrictions apply that may daunt us as crusaders. But the imagination itself is the problem. It is capable of saying everything but no. In our literature what has traveled the longest way through time is the great affirmative soul of Chaucer. The novel itself always affirms, it seems to me, by the nature of itself. It says what people are like. It doesn’t, and doesn’t know how to, describe what they are not like, and it would waste its time if it told us what we ought to be like, since we already know that, don’t we? But we may not know nearly so well what we are as when a novel of power reveals this to us. For the first time we may, as we read, see ourselves in our own situation, in some curious way reflected. By whatever way the novelist accomplishes it — there are many ways — truth is borne in on us in all its great weight and angelic lightness, and accepted as home truth.\\n\\nPassing judgment on his fellows, which is trying enough for anybody, is frustrating for an author. It is hardly the way to make the discoveries about living that he must have hoped for when he began to write. If he does not pass judgment, does this mean he has no conscience? Of course he has a conscience; it is, like his temperament, his own, and he is one hundred percent answerable to it, whether it is convenient or not. What matters is that a writer is committed to his own moral principles. If he is, when we read him we cannot help but be aware of what these are. Certainly the characters of his novel and the plot they move in are their ultimate reflections. But these convictions are implicit; they are deep down; they are the rock on which the whole structure of more than that novel rests.\\n\\nIndeed, we are more aware of his moral convictions through a novel than any flat statement of belief from him could make us. We are aware in that part of our mind that tells us truths about ourselves. Yet it is only by way of the imagination — the novelist’s to ours — that such private neighborhoods are reached.\\n\\nThere is still to mention what I think will give us, as the crusader-novelist, the hardest time: our voice will not be our own. The crusader’s voice is the voice of the crowd and must rise louder all the time, for there is, of course, the other side to be drowned out. Worse, the voices of most crowds sound alike. Worse still, the voice that seeks to do other than communicate when it makes a noise has something brutal about it; it is no longer using words as words but as something to brandish, with which to threaten, brag, or condemn. The noise is the simple assertion of self, the great, mindless, general self. And for all its volume it is ephemeral. Only meaning lasts. Nothing was ever learned in a crowd, from a crowd, or by addressing or trying to please a crowd. Even to deplore, yelling is out of place. To deplore a thing as hideous as the murder of the three civil rights workers demands the quiet in which to absorb it. Enormities can be lessened, cheapened, just as good and delicate things can be. We can and will cheapen all feeling by letting it go savage or parading in it.\\n\\nWriting fiction is an interior affair. Novels and stories always will be put down little by little out of personal feeling and personal beliefs arrived at alone and at firsthand over a period of time as time is needed. To go outside and beat the drum is only to interrupt, interrupt, and so finally to forget and to lose. Fiction has, and must keep, a private address. For life is lived in a private place; where it means anything is inside the mind and heart. Fiction has always shown life where it is lived, and good fiction, or so I have faith, will continue to do this.\\n\\nA Passage to India is an old novel now. It is an intensely moral novel. It deals with race prejudice. Mr. Forster, not by preaching at us, while being passionately concerned, makes us know his points unforgettably as often as we read it. And does he not bring in the dark! The points are good forty years after their day because of the splendor of the novel. What a lesser novelist’s harangues would have buried by now, his imagination still reveals. Revelation of even the strongest forces is delicate work.\\n\\nIndeed, great fiction shows us not how to conduct our behavior but how to feel. Eventually, it may show us how to face our feelings and face our actions and to have new inklings about what they mean. A good novel of any year can initiate us into our own new experience.\\n\\nFROM the working point of view of the serious writer of fiction, nothing has changed today but the externals. They are important externals; we may have developed an increased awareness of them, which is certainly to the good; we have at least the same capacity as ever for understanding, the same eyes and ears, same hearts to feel, same minds to agonize or remember or to try to put things together, see things in proportion with. While the raw material of our fiction is changing dramatically — as indeed it is changing everywhere — we are the same instruments of perceiving that we ever were. I should not trust us if we were not. And we do not know what is to be made out of experience at any time until the personal quotient has been added. To convey what we see around us, whatever it is, so as to let it speak for itself according to our lights is the same challenge it ever was, not a different one, not a greater one, only perhaps made harder by the times. Now as ever we must keep writing from what we know; and we must really know it.\\n\\nNo matter how fast society around us changes, what remains is that there is a relationship in progress between ourselves and other people; this was the case when the world seemed stable, too. There are relationships of the blood, of the passions and the affections, of thought and spirit and deed. There is the relationship between the races. How can one kind of relationship be set apart from the others? Like the great root system of an old and long-established growing plant, they are all tangled up together; to separate them you would have to cleave the plant itself from top to bottom.\\n\\nWhat must the Southern writer of fiction do today? Shall he do anything different from what he has always done?\\n\\nThere have already been giant events, some of them wrenchingly painful and humiliating. And now there is added the atmosphere of hate. We in the South are a hated people these days; we were hated first for actual and particular reasons, and now we may be hated still more in some vast unparticularized way. I believe there must be such a thing as sentimental hate. Our people hate back.\\n\\nI think the worst of it is we are getting stuck in it. We are like trapped flies with our feet not in honey but in venom. It’s not love that is the gluey emotion; it’s hate. As far as writing goes, which is as far as living goes, this is a devastating emotion. It could kill us. This hate seems in part shame for self, in part self-justification, in part panic that life is really changing.\\n\\nFury at ourselves and hurt pride, anger aroused too often, outrage at being hated need not obscure forever the sore spots we Southerners know better than our detractors. For some of us have shown bad hearts. As in the case of our better qualities, we are locally blessed with an understanding and intimate knowledge of our faults that our worst detractors cannot match, and have been in a less relentless day far more relentless, more eloquent, too, than they have yet learned to be.\\n\\nI do not presume to speak for my fellow Southern writers, a group of individuals if there ever was one. Yet I would like to point something out: in the rest of the country people seem suddenly aware now of what Southern fiction writers have been writing about in various ways for a great long time. We do not need reminding of what our subject is. It is humankind, and we are all part of it. When we write about people, black or white, in the South or anywhere, if our stories are worth the reading, we are writing about everybody.\\n\\nIn the South, we who are now at work may not learn to write it before we learn, or learn again, to live it — our full life in the South within its context, in its relation to the rest of the world. “Only connect,” Forster’s ever wise and gentle and daring words, could be said to us in our homeland quite literally at this moment. And while the Southern writer goes on portraying his South, which I think nobody else can do and which I believe he must do, then if his work is done well enough, it will reflect a larger mankind as it has done before.\\n\\nAnd so finally I think we need to write with love. Not in self-defense, not in hate, not in the mood of instruction, not in rebuttal, in any kind of militance, or in apology, but with love. Not in exorcisement, either, for this is to make the reader bear a thing for you.\\n\\nNeither do I speak of writing forgivingly; out of love you can write with straight fury. It is the source of the understanding that I speak of; it’s this that determines its nature and its reach.\\n\\nWe are told that Turgenev’s nostalgic, profoundly reflective, sensuously alive stories that grew out of his memories of early years reached the Czar and were given some credit by him when he felt moved to free the serfs in Russia. Had Turgenev set out to write inflammatory tracts instead of the sum of all he knew, could express, of life learned at firsthand, how much less of his mind and heart with their commitments, all implicit, would have filled his stories! But he might be one of us now, so directly are we touched, with 113 years gone by since they were first published.\\n\\nIndifference would indeed be corrupting to the fiction writer, indifference to any part of man’s plight. Passion is the chief ingredient of good fiction. It flames right out of sympathy for the human condition and goes into all great writing. (And of course passion and the temper are different things; writing in the heat of passion can be done with extremely good temper.) But to distort a work of passion for the sake of a cause is to cheat, and the end, far from justifying the means, is fairly sure to be lost with it. Then the novel will have been not the work of imagination, at once passionate and objective, made by a man struggling in solitude with something of his own to say, but a piece of catering.\\n\\nTo cater to is not to love and not to serve well either. We do need to bring to our writing, over and over again, all the abundance we possess. To be able, to be ready, to enter into the minds and hearts of our own people, all of them, to comprehend them (us) and then to make characters and plots in stories that in honesty and with honesty reveal them (ourselves) to us, in whatever situation we live through in our own times: this is the continuing job, and it’s no harder now than it ever was, I suppose. Every writer, like everybody else, thinks he’s living through the crisis of the ages. To write honestly and with all our powers is the least we can do, and the most.\\n\\nTime, though it can make happenings and trappings out of date, cannot do much to change the realities apprehended by the imagination. History will change in Mississippi, and the hope is that it will change in a beneficial direction and with a merciful speed, and above all bring insight, understanding. But when William Faulkner’s novels come to be pictures of a society that is no more, they will still be good and still be authentic because of what went into them from the man himself. Mankind still tries the same things and suffers the same falls, climbs up to try again, and novels are as true at one time as at another. Love and hate, hope and despair, justice and injustice, compassion and prejudice, truth-telling and lying work in all men; their story can be told in whatever skin they are wearing and in whatever year the writer can put them down.\\n\\nFaulkner is not receding from us. Indeed, his work, though it can’t increase in itself, increases us. His work throws light on the past and on today as it becomes the past — the day in its journey. This being so, it informs the future too.\\n\\nWhat is written in the South from now on is going to be taken into account by Faulkner’s work; I mean the remark literally. Once Faulkner had written, we could never unknow what he told us and showed us. And his work will do the same thing tomorrow. We inherit from him, while we can get fresh and firsthand news of ourselves from his work at any time.\\n\\nA source of illumination is not dated by what passes along under its ray, is not qualified or disqualified by the nature of the traffic. When the light of Faulkner’s work will be discovering things to us no more, it will be discovering us. Even we shall lie enfolded in perspective one day: what we hoped along with what we did, what we didn’t do, and not only what we were but what we missed being, what others yet to come might dare to be. For we are our own crusade. Before ever we write, we are. Instead of our judging Faulkner, he will be revealing us in books to later minds.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'When I carried the mail in Durham, North Carolina—back in the 1990s, before I became a historian—an older man used to greet me joyfully, “Here comes Uncle Sam!” To him, and to others on my route, I represented not just the chance of a letter, but also a connection to the federal government—and to an institution that had probably provided a relative with a steady job, and a path into the middle class. The United States Postal Service is among the country’s most popular institutions, enjoying approval ratings as high as 90 percent. The USPS delivers 48 percent of the world’s mail to 160 million homes. Yet in late March, as the Postal Service struggled to deal with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, President Trump threatened to veto a version of the $2.2 trillion bipartisan CARES Act stimulus package that contained a $13 billion grant to help the USPS keep meeting its payroll, gassing its vehicles, and paying its suppliers. What he finally signed instead included a $10 billion loan that would require approval by the Treasury Department.\\n\\nRead: The postal service is a civic institution, not a business\\n\\nTrump’s move triggered a wave of disbelief, with people taking to social media to thank letter carriers and buying stamps to keep the USPS afloat. But the truth is, the Postal Service has been under attack by conservatives for years. Trump’s personal hostility to the USPS—“the Post Office is a joke,” he said on Friday—merges with a long-standing Republican embrace of both postal privatization and the trope that the USPS is a mismanaged business. The Trump administration is now playing a costly game of chicken to get what it sought long before the current crisis: drastic service and facilities cuts, more noncareer labor and outsourcing, and a rollback of employee rights and benefits. If it succeeds, we’ll all be the poorer for it.\\n\\nAmerica’s post office was a revolutionary idea, born in 1775. From the start, it was intended to serve as a political and information network, a sharp contrast with European countries’ postal services, which primarily existed to bring revenue into the treasury. Today’s USPS is the direct descendant of the original U.S. Post Office Department.\\n\\nOn March 18, 1970, the successors of the original post riders revolted against both their employer and their union leaders in an eight-day nationwide illegal wildcat strike , demanding a living wage and job dignity as well as greater union democracy. The roots of the Postal Service’s current financial crisis lie in the compromise legislation that followed the strike, the 1970 Postal Reorganization Act. The act replaced the Post Office Department with a hybrid government agency and corporation that would provide full collective-bargaining rights to employees, become financially self-supporting, and continue to provide universal service at reasonable rates. Although the USPS provides a service mandated by the Constitution and federal law, it has received no federal funds since 1982, relying on postal product sales to keep revenue ahead of expenditures.\\n\\nThe Post Office has historically provided an avenue toward middle-class stability for a wide variety of Americans—veterans, new immigrants, rural migrants—but for no group has it been more important than for African Americans. The Post Office was for many years the nation’s largest employer of black workers; in the decades that followed its conversion into the USPS, blacks were at least twice as likely to work for the Postal Service as whites. The Postal Service today is 37 percent minority and 37 percent female.\\n\\nRead: From clerk to postmaster at one of the U.S.’s oldest post offices\\n\\nConservatives, who had previously argued for the privatization of the Post Office, continued those efforts after the 1971 creation of the Postal Service. But not until 2006, during the George W. Bush administration, did those efforts gain much traction. That year, Congress passed the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, imposing a unique burden on the Postal Service by requiring it to pre-fund retirees’ health benefits through annual payments of roughly $5.5 billion, for 10 years. These obligations, the rise of the internet, and the Great Recession combined put the USPS in the red, where it remains today: The USPS had $11 billion of outstanding debt at the end of the last fiscal year (which was up to $14.4 billion as of April 1). Excluding those debt payments, it should be noted, the USPS has finished each year with revenue surpluses for most of the past decade—as a 2018 Trump administration report documented.\\n\\nThe Postal Service survived the 2008–09 crisis in a diminished state. American homes and businesses did not stop growing or depending on the USPS, but hundreds of post offices and mail-processing centers were shuttered, many others had their hours cut, some services were reduced, and the postal workforce has lost 126,000 career positions since 2009.\\n\\nAfter years of indifference to the plight of the USPS from Republican-led Congresses, things finally seemed to be improving. On February 5 of this year, the House passed the USPS Fairness Act by a vote of 309–106—including support from almost half of House Republicans—and sent it to the Senate. But the bill is still sitting there, and in the interim, COVID-19 struck.\\n\\nThe volume of mail the USPS is delivering has already fallen by nearly one-third compared with last year, and it is now projected to lose $22 billion over the next 18 months. Postal workers are still doing their jobs, despite the risks; so far 1,219 postal workers have tested positive for the coronavirus, and 54 have died. The CARES Act included a $500 billion bailout for large corporations, but no help for the Postal Service. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin threatened to use any loan money to coerce the USPS to raise its package-shipping rates, allow him to oversee the hiring of senior USPS staff (including a new postmaster general), and demand union concessions. Trump confirmed this strategy as he signed the latest stimulus package on April 24, declaring that no loans would go to the USPS if it didn’t quadruple package rates.\\n\\nTrump’s willingness to block proposed bailout funds to the USPS—a 245-year-old government service—may reflect his personal grudge against Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon (and owner of The Washington Post), combined with an ignorance of how the USPS actually works. But it also reveals a conservative hostility to the Postal Service that antedates the current crisis. In its 2018 report, a Trump-appointed task force (led by Mnuchin) suggested drastic service and facilities cuts, more noncareer labor and outsourcing, and an end to the American Postal Workers Union’s collective-bargaining rights.\\n\\nJust like the first USPS crisis, sparked by the pre-funding requirement, this one is unnecessary and politically manufactured; and just like that earlier crisis, it is also very real. It threatens the center of America’s $1.6 trillion mailing industry, which employs 7.3 million people. The Postal Service can’t simply file for bankruptcy; the USPS is not a private corporation like FedEx, UPS, or Walmart—which even together could not handle the U.S. mail, contrary to some privatization fantasies. But with the USPS now projecting it will run out of operational funds by September, Trump could cripple the nation’s mail by blocking aid, forcing the USPS to prioritize which vendors to pay and which services to curtail. The USPS has said that it needs $89 billion in assistance, including $25 billion in grants.\\n\\nPriscilla Southwell: In the pandemic, every state should vote by mail\\n\\nWill House and Senate Democrats hold the line in future stimulus packages for USPS relief? Do they have the political will to save universal postal service along with 630,000 government jobs—80 percent of them good-paying career positions? To preserve the USPS is not to merely conserve it as some relic of the past. The 1970 Postal Reorganization Act says that the USPS should “bind the nation together.” Who else will distribute stimulus checks (as the unemployment rate climbs past 14 percent), census forms, online purchases, letters, parcels, books, magazines—in fact, anything that takes postage? How else can Americans vote by mail—as they now do in six states, and may soon need to do in all 50? Postal workers are out there right now, delivering face masks and test kits, and hopefully one day soon they’ll be delivering vaccines as well.\\n\\nIn 2011, during the last postal financial crisis, I wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post warning of what we’ll lose if we lose the Postal Service. That isn’t just the services it provides—that’s the jobs, the path into the middle class, and the glue holding communities together. So much has changed since then, but that much remains the same.'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-20T19:50:00',\n",
       "   'content': '(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to This Post)\\n\\nBeing our semi-regular, weekly survey of what’s goin’ down in the several states where, as we know, the real work of governmentin’ gets done and where a guy comes down the street, crazy as a loon.\\n\\nWe begin in where-the-fck else, Texas, where a local ICE attorney seems to have had a completely predictable side hustle. From the Texas Observer:\\n\\nThat same Tuesday morning, an X account with over 17,000 followers named GlomarResponder made an ominous post. “Yeah, I’m in a courthouse wating [sic] on warrants,” GlomarResponder wrote. “Turns out there’s a lot of bitch work to be done to make mass deportations happen.” One day prior, GlomarResponder had posted that he “Can confirm all of those,” regarding a list of cities where ICE was expected to begin deportation operations the next day. “May have a betting pool to see who can guess which one I’m at on any particular day, based on the news,” GlomarResponder wrote.\\n\\nThese were but the latest posts that GlomarResponder has made over the years that suggest the operator of the account is an ICE employee. GlomarResponder has also routinely expressed blatantly racist and anti-immigrant views. Through an extensive review of GlomarResponder’s X posts, publicly available documents, and other social media profiles and posts, the Texas Observer has identified the operator of GlomarResponder as James “Jim” Joseph Rodden, a 44-year-old who works as an assistant chief counsel for ICE in the Dallas area. Rodden represents the agency in immigration court hearings where judges decide whether an individual is removed from the country.\\n\\nThe Xwitter account is a sewer, as you probably have guessed.\\n\\nSince GlomarResponder was first created in 2012, the account has posted hateful, xenophobic, and pro-fascist content. “America is a White nation, founded by Whites.… Our country should favor us,” GlomarResponder wrote last month. “All blacks are foreign to my people, dumb fuck,” the account posted. ...“I’m not a commie, I’m a fascist,” GlomarResponder posted a couple weeks later. “Fascists solve communist problems. Get your insults right, retard.” In August, GlomarResponder posted: “‘Migrants’ are all criminals.” Two months later, GlomarResponder shared an image that reads: “It is our holy duty to guard against the foreign hordes.”\\n\\n“All the best people” isn’t as much fun the second time around.\\n\\nStaying in Texas for the moment, here is another completely predictable, if infinitely more tragic, bit of news from ProPublica:\\n\\nPregnancy became far more dangerous in Texas after the state banned abortion in 2021, ProPublica found in a first-of-its-kind data analysis. The rate of sepsis shot up more than 50% for women hospitalized when they lost their pregnancies in the second trimester, ProPublica found. The surge in this life-threatening condition, caused by infection, was most pronounced for patients whose fetus may still have had a heartbeat when they arrived at the hospital.\\n\\nProPublica previously reported on two such cases in which miscarrying women in Texas died of sepsis after doctors delayed evacuating their uteruses. Doing so would have been considered an abortion. The new reporting shows that, after the state banned abortion, dozens more pregnant and postpartum women died in Texas hospitals than had in pre-pandemic years, which ProPublica used as a baseline to avoid Covid-19-related distortions. As the maternal mortality rate dropped nationally, ProPublica found, it rose substantially in Texas.\\n\\nFurther pro-life details to follow:\\n\\nForced to wait 40 hours as her dying fetus pressed against her cervix, Josseli Barnica risked a dangerous infection. Doctors didn’t induce labor until her fetus no longer had a heartbeat. Physicians waited, too, as Nevaeh Crain’s organs failed. Before rushing the pregnant teenager to the operating room, they ran an extra test to confirm her fetus had expired. Both women had hoped to carry their pregnancies to term, both suffered miscarriages and both died.\\n\\nThe situation has become so bad and so politically perilous, not to mention so utterly inhumane, that even some of the state’s Republicans are behind amendments designed at least to bring some clarity to the state’s physicians in situations like these. However, this is Texas, where the last good idea died of thirst.\\n\\nSome prominent Texas Republicans who helped write and pass Texas’ strict abortion bans have recently said that the law should be changed to protect women’s lives—though it’s unclear if proposed amendments will receive a public hearing during the current legislative session. ProPublica’s findings indicate that the law is getting in the way of providing abortions that can protect against life-threatening infections, said Dr. Sarah Prager, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Washington. “We have the ability to intervene before these patients get sick,” she said. “This is evidence that we aren’t doing that.”\\n\\nFor similar pro-life exercises, we must adjourn to Missouri, where you ladies who are With Child are not being treated as suspects, oh, no, not a bit. From Fox2 in St. Louis:\\n\\nHouse Bill 807, nicknamed the “Save MO Babies Act,” was proposed by Rep. Phil Amato, R-Arnold. The bill summary states that if passed, the state would create a registry of every expectant mother in the state “who is at risk for seeking an abortion” through the Department of Social Services, the Division of Maternal and Child Services. It would go into effect July 1, 2026.... It was not specified in the bill how expectant mothers “at risk” for seeking abortion would be identified.\\n\\nOf course not. Why would that be important? Just so creepy old dudes can keep tabs on the brood-sow population? This Orwellian nightmare is couched in a lot of nice-time stuff regarding adoption, but it’s also replete with references to women who are “at risk” of seeking abortion services. It seems to me that women are more “at risk” in Texas emergency rooms these days, but what do I know?\\n\\nWe move north to Wisconsin, where they have another open Supreme Court seat, so there’s another expensive brawl under way. Ann Walsh Bradley, a liberal justice, is retiring, and former state attorney general Brad Schimel, who spent his term as AG as a stalwart advocate of voter-suppression tactics, is running against Susan Crawford, a circuit judge who led the fight against the radical voter-ID law that Schimel championed as attorney general. From Bolts magazine:\\n\\nThis court has recently leaned in favor of expanding voter access and making democracy more representative. In 2023, it threw out gerrymandered Republican legislative maps that had locked the GOP in power. In 2024, it allowed ballot drop boxes to return to Wisconsin, reversing an earlier ruling. Last month, it ruled against a conservative activist who had sought voters’ private information in order to hunt for ineligible voters and build the case that Wisconsin elections are fraudulent. This new tendency in support of voting rights was catalyzed by the 2023 victory of Janet Protasiewicz, who gave liberal justices a 4-3 majority over conservatives. (Supreme court elections in Wisconsin are officially nonpartisan.) This flipped the court to liberals for the first time since at least 2008.\\n\\n(It is here where I mention again my feeling that an elected judiciary is the second-worst idea in American politics.)\\n\\nThe race quickly attained the customary national profile. (Watching Marquette play basketball here in the Commonwealth—God save it!—on Fox Sports, I find myself watching TV ads for the Schimel-Crawford race.) Crawford seems to be running a liberal-but-tough-on-crime campaign while attacking Schimel on abortion rights. Meanwhile, Schimel is bringing the usual GOP caterwauling about how “courts” are forcing boys into girls bathrooms. However, the way it has energized Wisconsin’s politics for a decade now, voting rights is the real underground fire coursing through the campaign.\\n\\nVoting rights advocates are closely watching the election as well. A host of issues related to voter access—the use of drop boxes, accommodations for disabled voters, and voter ID rules, to name a few—may also ride on this court’s composition.\\n\\n“The latest makeup of the court has been a major pro for access to democracy,” said Sam Liebert, a former Wisconsin election clerk who now directs the state chapter of the pro-voter access group All Voting Is Local. “It’s so important that we have a supreme court that recognizes that the right to vote is a right.” Conservatives have also drummed up attention to the April contest’s importance for elections policy. “Very important to vote Republican for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to prevent voting fraud!” Elon Musk posted on X in January, echoing the right’s unfounded claims that Wisconsin elections are fraught with fraud. “Elon Musk highlighted a critical issue in this race: election integrity,” Schimel told a conservative radio host.\\n\\nWho asked you, Elmo? Musk is expected to pump a cool million behind Schimel. Anyway, the campaign is likely going to cost more than $50 million before the election is held on April 1.\\n\\nAnd we conclude, as is our new custom, in the great state of Oklahoma, whence Blog Official Snark-in-Exile, Friedman of the Algarve, brings us the tale of legislators with far too much time on their hands. From Oklahoma Voice:\\n\\nNov. 5 would be President Donald J. Trump Day in Oklahoma under a measure that passed a Senate panel on Wednesday. Senate Bill 1105 would add the holiday to a long list, which already includes Jefferson Day on April 13 and Will Rogers Day on Nov. 4.\\n\\nHere’s the real kicker, though.\\n\\nSen. Dana Prieto, R-Tulsa, said his measure would not require employers to provide time off. “There are a lot of days we don’t get off for,” he said. “Many holidays are just excuses for stores to be able to have a sale. Nobody is going to be taking off for this.”\\n\\nThis guy phonies up a holiday for the worst political figure since Vlad the Impaler and he doesn’t even have the decency to give people the day off? What a piker! Doesn’t he realize how many people are going to be drunk at work that day?\\n\\nThis is your democracy, America. Cherish it.'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-22T16:00:00',\n",
       "   'content': 'The fantasy usually goes like this. A friend of mine comes over, and we wander into my shimmering Babylonian spire of a library, with shelves of books ascending into the atmosphere. The only way to access them is by using the star of the show: the book ladder.\\n\\nNo matter what we’re discussing, I ceremoniously take it as an opportunity to say, “You know, that reminds me of a passage from … ,” and then I roll the ladder to my desired location, climb up into the heavens, open a book, and nod knowingly. “Yes, this is what I was thinking of.” Muttering a line of Donne or Chaucer or Plath, I then descend the ladder, reading in a professorial tone, and eventually hand the book to my friend, as if he asked for it.\\n\\nThis fantasy is not mine alone. The book ladder is the pinnacle of achievement for any aspiring book lover. Gliding along a railing system parallel to the bookcase, it is the finishing touch that completes any library, whether public or personal. Its presence makes tangible an embrace of learning, represented by a wall of needlessly high books anchored by the most specialized of ladders. It signals to guests that you’ve ostensibly read so many books and acquired so much alleged knowledge that you need extra assistance to get to it.\\n\\nIn Beauty and the Beast, we see Belle, a bookworm whose sophistication seems to make her the precise opposite of her co-star, skating across the floor on a book ladder like it’s her dance partner. In Funny Face, the dream becomes a nightmare as Audrey Hepburn gets coldly pushed across the room on her sliding ladder by invading fashion photographers, a superficial bunch who subsequently do the worst thing possible to the owner of a book ladder: rearrange her books. In The Brutalist, Adrien Brody plays an architect who designs perhaps the most minimalist personal library possible, involving a round room lined to the ceiling with retractable doors, and a single postwar chair to admire it all. Yet appraising the precipitous heights of the shelves, one can’t help but worry he’s forgotten one thing: Where’s the book ladder?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“There is—and has long been—a physical appeal to being blanketed by books,” Evan Friss, author of The Bookshop: A History of the American Bookstore, tells me. “The ladder is a symbol of the scale of the collection, which can be awe-inspiring—both just to look at aesthetically and to consider how much knowledge is held in those books (some, hopefully, imparted onto the reader).”\\n\\nLadders obviously existed long before their literary redesign. They’re an ancient tool that’s been around for thousands of years across cultures, with perhaps the oldest known example depicted in a 8,000–10,000-year-old Mesolithic rock painting in a cave in Spain. But in that painting, the subject, being a primitive man, is not in search of books, but rather some honey. Similarly, in the Old Testament, Jacob dreamed of a ladder stretching to heaven, but it’s not clear that heaven, for him, meant books piled higher than any man could reach on his own.\\n\\nPeople wanting to display their books as trophies is nothing new, but it accelerated in the 15th century, when Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press. Over the next few hundred years, the number of books that were printed underwent exponential growth—as did the yearning to show them off.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDuring the Victorian era, personal libraries became more robust, as wealthy people sought books with luxury bindings that looked great on shelves. Consider a scene in The Great Gatsby in which the character Owl Eyes marvels at Gatsby’s too-perfect-looking study. “Absolutely real—have pages and everything,” he says. “I thought they’d be a nice durable cardboard.” It wasn’t just Owl Eyes who had cottoned on to the scheme. In The Bookshop, Friss recounts a journalist in the 1920s who offered best practices regarding “domestic bookaflage”:\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nYou can group a few high-brow books at a strategic point so that as the guest enters his eye will fall upon them at once and he will whisper to himself: “Ah! At last I am en\\xadtering the home of a cultivated American!” You don’t have to read them. You are safe. Nobody any more talks about the books they have read.\\n\\nFor ages such books were kept within human grasp, and only required the occasional stepping stool to pluck out the higher editions. But as the books continued to stack up, it became inevitable that some enterprising carpenter would propose a means for stacking them even higher. Enter Benjamin Franklin. He didn’t invent the book ladder, mainly because he didn’t think old men should be using ladders to grab books. (“Old men find it inconvenient to mount a ladder or steps for that purpose, their heads being sometimes subject to giddinesses,” he wrote.) So Franklin, an avid reader who was in many ways the original self-made man, conceived a contraption called the Long Arm, which involved a stick of pine with a sort of loop attached, allowing readers to lasso an out-of-reach book.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIt’s less clear who invented the book ladder, likely because using a ladder to reach high-up books is probably an idea that many libraries and collectors arrived at on their own. If there’s a ladder in the vicinity, and you lean it against a bookcase to grab a copy of Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations, that’s now a de facto book ladder. Still, according to America’s oldest rolling-ladder maker, the century-old Putnam Rolling Ladders, whose customers have included George W. Bush, credit for the first dedicated book ladder goes to a French furniture designer named Étienne Avril. In the mid-18th century, Avril created a ladder that rested on two rails attached to the bookcase and could be moved along the shelves as needed.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMany of the early book ladders were more similar to stepladders, essentially mini wooden staircases that contained ornate hand-carvings on the railings, atop a wide base that could be rolled up to access higher altitudes. While these rolling stepladders are still used, what we know as the library ladder evolved into a regular ladder with wheels that slid along a railing system or had hooks that attached to a bar above the bookcase. You can also see such ladders in mercantiles, clothing stores, wineries, and anywhere that people need things in high places, but it’s with books that they hold the most charm.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“You not only have to use your hands to turn the page,” Shannon Mattern, a professor of media studies at the University of Pennsylvania who studies how furniture structures our performance of intellectual labor, tells me. “But in this case you have to get down off the ladder, physically slide the thing—your whole body has to move. It’s kind of like a scaling up of the analog engagement with the book.” And at a time when so much reading is done digitally, this holds an even more powerful nostalgic appeal.\\n\\nWe tend to see the high shelves and cascading ladder almost as a reflection of what we think our brain looks like, so grandiose that physical contraptions are required to access it all, whereas the rest of humanity is tied to the ground. One wants to float across the room on it, letting our hands drag against the leather-bound hardbacks in a smug orgiastic haze.\\n\\nFor now, unfortunately, most of us are limited to books on shelves that we can too easily reach. So if you’ve neither the space nor budget to bring a book ladder into your life, there is one other way to magnificently demonstrate the breadth of your supposed reading: the book wheel. Designed by Agostino Ramelli in the 16th century, the giant vertical wheel lets one have multiple books open at a time and read each of them in one spot with ease. It’s a bit hard to get your hands on, but unlike the book ladder, you’ll only need a few books to justify its presence.'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-21T16:00:00',\n",
       "   'content': 'This article contains spoilers for Yellowjackets Season 3, Episode 3.\\n\\nOne of the things that distinguishes serialized television from other, more self-contained art forms is that it’s based in a promise: Give me this many hours of your life, this many years of your sustained attention and your emotional involvement, and it will all be worth it. It starts a little slow, you’ll hear, or You have to power through the first season, but stick with it. The fact that shows stretch over long periods of time is ideally one of the medium’s strengths; you can forge a powerful connection with a story’s character in the two hours it takes to watch a movie or the two weeks it takes to read a novel, but it’s not the same as the bond you form when you’ve lived through a chunk of your life alongside them, spent the time between episodes or the long stretches between seasons wondering what might happen next.\\n\\nThe downside of this arrangement is that the streaming era has turned a profound connection forged by commitment and regularity into a situationship that has to be reestablished every time a show manages to get back on the air. It’s been close to two years since the previous season of Yellowjackets, a rocky string of episodes that had many who fell hard for its darkly funny first season wondering if the series was capable of sustaining itself long term or if this might be the moment to discreetly ghost and move on. Its strike-delayed third season, which debuted last week, seemed in a hurry to establish a new baseline, contracting its present-day storyline to focus more squarely on the principal characters (no more mysterious cult compounds) and jumping its teenage plane-crash survivors past their first winter in the wilderness so they can tap into food sources other than each other.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe third season’s third episode, “Them’s the Brakes,” is written by Yellowjackets creators Ashley Lyle and Bart Nickerson with co-showrunner Jonathan Lisco, a TV veteran who was brought on after the pilot was picked up to series. It’s the first time since the show’s second episode—the first after the series got a full-season order—the three have shared a writing credit, increasing the sense that all hands have been brought on to steady the ship. And yet the episode climaxes with a sequence, and one moment in particular, that will likely be some viewers’ cue to jump over the side.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe episode’s driving storyline takes place in the 1990s timeline, in which the beleaguered Coach Ben (Steven Krueger) has taken Mari (Alexa Barajas) hostage in his cave. The surviving Yellowjackets suspect Ben, likely correctly, of having set fire to the cabin they formerly occupied, and although the girls haven’t yet progressed to outright homicide, it’s clear they’re willing to put those they consider outsiders in a position where the wilderness they worship will do the dirty work for them. Ben, however, lacks that killer instinct, and he lets Mari escape. After a half-hearted-at-best effort to keep the secret that Ben is alive and hiding nearby, Mari tells the other girls everything, which leads to a search party headed straight for Ben’s cave. Three of the girls, Shauna (Sophie Nélisse), Van (Liv Hewson), and Akilah (Nia Sondaya), wriggle through a narrow passageway and get lost in the dark, unknowingly stumbling into an area of the cave where the air is either tainted or sufficiently deoxygenated enough that they start having visions. And that’s when things truly go off the rails.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nShauna’s vision is clear enough. She finds herself in the middle of a vast mountain lake, clad only in a white nightgown, and she sees a young boy waving from the shoreline. Recognizing him as an older version of the stillborn baby she gave birth to in the previous season, she swims and swims but never seems to get any closer. Van, meanwhile, finds a door in the cave wall that opens into the cabin, where she takes a seat by the fire. An ember falls to the floor and begins to smolder, and Van moves to stomp it out, but she finds herself stuck in her chair, which is also a seat from the plane in which she and her teammates went down. At first, it’s just a lap belt that’s holding her back, but then she’s grabbed by several soot-streaked arms, some of which are still sheathed in yellow-and-blue varsity jackets.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThese visions aren’t exactly hard to interpret—indeed, one of Yellowjackets’ weaknesses, which has become clearer over time, is a difficulty in leaving room for interpretation without feeling evasive or, worse, undecided. The show is built around a central, unsettling ambiguity: Just how real is the unseen “it” whose will the girls believe they’re following? The presence of cryptic symbols that appear to predate their crash-landing in the wilderness seems to hint that “it” is not simply a figment of their collective imaginations, nor an ad hoc system of beliefs constructed for the purpose of deflecting responsibility for their more desperate and questionable actions. (The girls didn’t simply let Jackie and Javi die, then feast on their flesh; the wilderness chose.)\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nRelated From Slate The Problem With The White Lotus Read More\\n\\nBut Yellowjackets, at least thus far, seems like a show that doesn’t openly believe in the supernatural or think that people need a push from demonic or chaotic forces to do monstrous things. The shimmering surf guitar that scores Van’s vision feels like an homage, deliberate or otherwise, to the otherworldly dreamscape of Twin Peaks. But David Lynch’s Black Lodge wasn’t a red herring. The show, and Lynch himself, behaved as if evil were a genuine force, malignant and comprehensible, one that even the pure-hearted Agent Cooper could fall suddenly and permanently victim to. Yellowjackets’ “it,” by contrast, feels more and more like a simple plot contrivance, one whose indeterminate nature can be stretched out for as long as Showtime keeps ordering new seasons.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe wear, however, is starting to show. Yellowjackets started off as a delightfully macabre riff on the mean-girls genre, a spooky, black-hearted comedy about the lingering wounds of high school trauma. When the adult foursome of Shauna, Natalie, Taissa, and Misty strolled into their 25th high school reunion in Season 1, all slow-motion swagger and fuck-you style, it felt as if the series had grafted something universal onto something highly specific (namely, the experience of spending 25 years keeping the secret that you ate some of your friends in order to survive). But three seasons in now, that delicate balance has been disrupted, and the writers can’t seem to find their footing. Which brings us back to Akilah’s vision.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAkilah’s cave-spawned hallucination starts with a pan down a white picket fence, which mirrors the opening of Lynch’s Blue Velvet. But instead of a severed ear nestled in a sunny field, she encounters something even stranger: a talking llama. (Yes, you read that right.) Among the chickens and sheep stands an Andean herbivore, whose mouth moves as it warns her, “Everything with teeth bites. … It can be easy, or it can be hard, but either way, it’s gonna get what it wants.” Like Van’s and Shauna’s visions, Akilah’s seems like a straightforward extension of her inner turmoil: Shauna is still reeling from the death of her child; Van is struggling with survivor’s guilt; and Akilah, whom Lottie, the leader of the girls’ burgeoning cult, has held up as a kind of prophet, is worried about what the future holds and what will happen the next time they run low on fresh meat. But where Twin Peaks’ cryptic divinations were issued in the backward-masked whoosh of a mysterious man, Yellowjackets has chosen another voice for its emissary from the other side: that of Big Pussy.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAlthough it may take a minute to process what on earth is going on, that is, in fact, the voice of Vincent Pastore, The Sopranos’ Salvatore Bonpensiero, coming out of the llama’s mouth. Indeed, even if you are tempted to rage-quit the show after this moment, it’s worth sticking around through the end credits, just to see the words Llama: Vincent Pastore. Why would the embodied spirit of wild savagery talk like a midlevel mobster? Well, these girls are from New Jersey, even if the ones who died in the mid-’90s never had a chance to see James Gandolfini pick up the Star-Ledger in his slippers. (Getting carved up for team dinner is one thing, but missing the dawn of prestige TV is a real tragedy.) It’s supposed to be funny and weird, to reflect the understanding that not everything the mind conjures up under extreme stress is going to be ominous or even sensible. But it feels like flailing, a big swing and a miss at a moment when the show cannot afford any more strikes.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nNo matter how attached you are to the characters or the performers—I, personally, would watch Melanie Lynskey play the adult Shauna until one of us drops dead—Yellowjackets has hitched its wagon to the unraveling of its central mystery, and the show will live or die on how satisfyingly it’s resolved. As if that weren’t already clear, “Them’s the Brakes” features a scene of the adult Lottie and Shauna’s teenage daughter dancing to Cass Elliot’s “Make Your Own Kind of Music,” a song strongly associated with (and, many would say, owned by) the show that brought the idea of the mystery box into the vernacular: Lost. Perhaps it didn’t matter why the sharks had Dharma Initiative branding or what was up with the four-toed statue, but Lost was structured to promise answers to even the smallest of questions, and when they didn’t arrive, many viewers felt cheated, distracted from the emotions of its teary finale by the enigma of who was in the outrigger. (See also: the goats on Severance.) We don’t need to know what a show’s master plan is—in fact, it’s more fun if we have to keep guessing at it—but it’s crucial to feel that there is one, or at least that the writers are capable of coming up with an explanation that makes everything seem inevitable in retrospect. We don’t need to know where we’re going, but we need the sense that we’re going somewhere. Otherwise we’ll start shaking that mystery box, listening for the rattle until we wonder if there’s anything inside it at all.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Sarah Lund stands in a muddy field outside Copenhagen under a cloud-clotted sky. Her partner, Jan—a rash, hot-tempered man set to take over her job when she moves to Sweden with her boyfriend—insists that the trail has gone cold. Lund’s eyebrows move almost imperceptibly together in the ghost of a frown. “What’s on the other side of the road?” she demands, her intuition activated. A canal. Over Jan’s exasperated objections, she has the waterway dredged, and up comes a car. In its trunk: the body of the teenage girl the detectives have been searching for since she was reported missing the previous day.\\n\\nLund, the main character of the 2007 Danish TV series Forbrydelsen (The Killing) is the ur–sweater detective, and not just because of her iconic collection of Fair Isle knitwear. The sweater-detective series is a distinctive form of crime television, broody and dark, born in Scandinavia and spreading, with regional variations, across the Western world. Its roots lie in the flavor of crime fiction known as Nordic noir, but its branches include such popular English-language series as Broadchurch and Mare of Easttown. Once acquired, a person’s taste for sweater detectives can become voracious, compelling fans to trade recommendations in online forums, scan blogs for announcements of much-awaited new shows, and subscribe to small, specialty streaming services like MHz Choice and Viaplay. We just can’t get enough.\\n\\nAs for what makes a sweater-detective show, the sweater-detective fan mostly knows ’em when she sees ’em, but I’ll take a shot at a definition. First, despite the wool-swaddled moniker, sweater-detective series are decidedly not cozy. Their melancholy heroes move through dimly lit interiors and stand in alcoves, gazing out into the rain like that other Sarah, played by Mireille Enos, in the American remake of The Killing. Although some movies approach the sweater-detective aesthetic, it’s a genre whose long, complex plots are best suited to TV. Instead of the case-of-the-week format used by basic procedurals like Law & Order or the twee mysteries cranked out by the British (Midsomer Murders, Father Brown, etc.—the U.S. equivalent would be Murder, She Wrote), a sweater-detective series needs an entire season to explore and solve a single case.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThat’s because sweater-detective series take murder seriously, rather than presenting it as just a nifty puzzle to solve. The Killing, in both its Danish and American versions, weaves together multiple plotlines about the investigation, the grief suffered by the victim’s family, and the ripples the crime sends through the entire community, reaching as far as a local election campaign and exposing dark secrets under the placid facade of everyday life. This focus on character and setting often leads to complaints from philistines that these shows are “too slow,” but the true sweater-detective aficionado understands that atmosphere and culture are as important as plot twists and car chases. As Veena Sud, who developed the American version of The Killing, puts it, the form is “slow-burn storytelling in a sense that every moment that we don’t have to prettify or gloss over or make something necessarily easy to digest,” the creators are “able to go to all sorts of places that are honest, and dark, and beautiful and tragic.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTypically, the damage caused by the crimes in these shows extends even to the detectives themselves, as in Bron/Broen, or The Bridge, a 2011 Danish/Swedish co-production so influential it has been remade as The Tunnel in the U.K. and as a short-lived 2013 American series also called The Bridge. Sometimes the case leaves one of the detectives nearly destroyed, although there’s always hope that he or she will rally for the next season.\\n\\nAs for the sweaters—well, they’re not obligatory, even if one of the current specimens of the genre, Shetland, sports a title that applies not only to the show’s windswept Scottish island setting but also to an actual type of sweater. If series like The Killing and Bron/Broen took place in the sorts of urban environments associated with noir fiction, their successors have often opted for rural settings and small towns, in chilly countryside best described as possessing an austere beauty. Trapped takes place in a small Icelandic fishing village cut off by a fearsome blizzard. Fortitude is titled after the outpost on a Norwegian island where a mysterious crime wave occurs. In the absence of snow and ice, as Broadchurch illustrates, some dramatic cliffs for the detective to stand atop, gazing out to sea, will do nicely.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe sweater detective is always a police officer because, unlike a private eye, a police detective is meant to be the agent of a social order the series will eventually lead us to doubt. I’ll also decree that the crime under investigation—a disappearance or a murder—must be enigmatic, even eerie. Organized crime, with its obvious and not very interesting motives, has no place at the center of such a series. The undergirding premise of the sweater-detective narrative is the unfathomability of human nature and human evil, the chaos or malice that the detective has sworn to combat but that all too often swallows her whole.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIf you’ve gotten this far in reading about sweater detectives, what you’re probably seeking is not more definitions but more recommendations, so here are a few sweater-detective standouts to while away the dregs of a very dismal winter.\\n\\nThe Chestnut Man (1 season)\\n\\nBased on the Søren Sveistrup novel of the same title, this moodily filmed Danish serial-killer yarn features a mismatched pair of detectives (an abiding genre trope) investigating bodies found next to small dolls made of chestnuts. The opening scenes indicate a connection to the murder of a rural family 30 years earlier. Then, the fingerprint of a government minister’s missing daughter is discovered on one of the dolls, tying the case into the intricacies of her political career as well as the inescapable past.\\n\\nStreaming on Netflix.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDeadwind (3 seasons)\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAll three cases caught by Finnish detective Sofia Karppi (Pihla Viitala) begin with bodies found in strange circumstances, the investigation of which takes Karppi and her rookie partner from the highest levels of Helsinki society to its dregs. From wind-power farms to public works projects and the pharmaceutical industry, big business always seems to be tangled up in these crimes. Meanwhile, the widowed Karppi must cope with raising her two children as she grieves for her husband and, like most TV detectives, devotes too much time to her job.\\n\\nStreaming on Netflix.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTrapped (2 seasons)\\n\\nSet in a remote Icelandic town as it is cut off from the world by a storm, this is one of the great sweater-detective series. Ólafur Darri Ólafsson plays Andri, the chief of police, a lovable, bearded sad-sack bear chastened by his estranged wife’s new romance and his stalled career. Then, a headless torso is hauled out of the fjord by fishermen. The feds in Reykjavík—led by a handsome, strapping local boy made good, with whom Andri has an amusing rivalry—can’t fly in, so Andri finally gets his chance to solve a major crime, as long as he and his sleepy team can rise to the occasion.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAvailable for digital rental on Amazon; a third season is streaming on Netflix under the title Entrapped.\\n\\nTop of the Lake (2 seasons)\\n\\nElisabeth Moss plays Robin, a Sydney detective who is visiting the small New Zealand town where she grew up when a very young girl is found standing in the icy titular lake, five months pregnant. Agreeing to help interview the child, Robin is drawn into the case, which soon leads to murder and surfaces Robin’s memories of being gang-raped at 15. Complicating matters is a peculiar feminist cult buying up land to the fury of the local good old boys. Rage at the casual misogyny and racism of rural life courses through this elegant thriller, created by the Oscar-winning director Jane Campion.\\n\\nStreaming on Hulu.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nRelated From Slate Top of the Lake Is Myth-Mad, But It Gets Under Your Skin Read More\\n\\nThe Killing (American version) (4 seasons)\\n\\nFans can argue endlessly over the superiority of their preferred version of this foundational sweater-detective series, but no one can contest that the U.S. version of The Killing stays true to the genre’s fundamentals, right down to the Fair Isle sweaters worn by Mireille Enos’ dour Sarah Linden. In place of the snow savored by Nordic noir buffs, there’s the endless rain of Seattle and the foggy vistas across Puget Sound—all providing a suitably gloomy backdrop for Linden’s rumination over her investigation into the murder of a local girl.\\n\\nStreaming on Hulu, AMC+, and Acorn TV.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWisting (5 seasons)\\n\\nThis long-running show, based on a series of novels by Jørn Lier Horst, focuses on a police detective working in a small city in southern Norway. A mournful widower with an old shoe of a face, Wisting (Sven Nordin) often finds his investigations confounded by his adult daughter (Thea Green Lundberg), an ambitious newspaper journalist, and aided by a tough FBI agent played by Carrie-Anne Moss. The series begins with the discovery of a corpse buried under the snow at a Christmas tree farm and the story of a man whose death at home was not discovered for weeks, a seemingly sad tale of modern loneliness that is not all it seems. This one is tightly written and eminently bingeable.\\n\\nStreaming on AMC+.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHappy Valley (3 seasons)\\n\\nOK, this masterpiece of a series by British showrunner Sally Wainwright doesn’t technically feature a detective. Catherine Cawood (the ever-magnificent Sarah Lancashire) is a police sergeant in Yorkshire who regards the detectives on the force with a resentful, working-class skepticism. Her nemesis is a serial rapist and murderer whose assault on Catherine’s daughter resulted in the girl’s suicide. It further resulted in a child, a boy Catherine is raising and trying to protect from his father’s influence, while also providing a home for her sister, who is recovering from addiction. It’s the harsh northern setting and the many emotional conundrums of Catherine’s life, alongside the suspenseful quest to bring her daughter’s rapist to justice, that give Happy Valley that inimitable sweater-detective angst.\\n\\nStreaming on AMC+ via Amazon.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nRelated From Slate You Should Watch This Great British Crime Show With a Tough Female Detective and Almost No Guns Read More\\n\\nBroadchurch (3 seasons)\\n\\nThe first season of this series set the bar for British sweater detectives, despite its setting on the relatively sunny (for England) coast of Dorset. The titular seaside town is rocked by the killing of an 11-year-old found dead on those photogenic white cliffs. Local Detective Sgt. Ellie Miller (Olivia Colman) teams up with the abrasive outsider Detective Inspector Alec Hardy (David Tennant) for a case made even more fraught by Ellie’s close friendship with the dead child’s parents. As the investigation unfolds, it exposes the many fault lines underlying the seemingly tranquil small town. Broadchurch, with its wrenching conclusion, illustrates a key characteristic of the sweater-detective series: By the end of the season, the detectives themselves will be profoundly changed.\\n\\nStreaming on Peacock and Tubi.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nRelated From Slate Broadchurch: Not Guilty, but Not Innocent Either Read More\\n\\nThe Bridge (Danish/Swedish version) (4 seasons)\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nLike the Danish version of The Killing, this classic series minted a prototype for many shows to come. A corpse is found arranged across the border between Denmark and Sweden, creating a joint-jurisdiction case. Sweden provides the neurodivergent Detective Saga Norén (Sofia Helin), while the Danes assign the congenial Martin Rohde (Kim Bodnia). Their quarry is the so-called Truth Terrorist, who claims to be using his crimes to shed light on social problems and personal hypocrisy. After a bumpy start—including Swedish/Danish culture clashes highly entertaining to Scandinavians but largely undetectable to American viewers—Saga and Martin learn to work together. Yet, as the investigation proceeds, the blows the killer strikes come ever closer to home, upending and undermining the characters we think we’ve come to know.\\n\\nStreaming on MHz.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe Killing (Danish version) (3 seasons)\\n\\nThe teenage daughter of a moving-company owner vanishes after a school party, then turns up drowned in the trunk of a car rented by an upstart mayoral campaign. Detective Sarah Linden (the charismatic Sofie Gråbøl), about to leave for a quieter life in Sweden, gets sucked into the investigation, much to the annoyance of her family and the green detective hired to replace her. In many ways, this is a fairly basic TV mystery, sounding familiar notes about the friction between the detective’s job and her personal life. But creator Søren Sveistrup’s tender attention to character and community—while still delivering suspense and twists—has made The Killing one of the most influential crime series of the 21st century.\\n\\nStreaming on MHz.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nPagan Peak (3 seasons)\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe cliché of the detective who looks so long into the abyss that the abyss looks back at him gets a serious, thoughtful treatment in this brilliant series. In a nod to The Bridge, a cheerful, outgoing German detective, Ellie Stocker (Julia Jentsch), is paired with a cynical Austrian, Gedeon Winter (a marvelously louche Nicholas Ofczarek), to find a serial killer who operates across the border while sporting a terrifying Krampus mask. As expected, the pair soon come to respect each other’s acumen, and the case even revives the corrupt Gedeon’s sense of purpose. Yet each detective makes disastrous mistakes that, for a while, botch the investigation and even compromise their own integrity. Their search for justice leaves both of them utterly transformed.\\n\\nStreaming on MHz.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nShetland (9 seasons)\\n\\nBased on novels by Ann Cleeves, this series makes the most of its setting on the windy, treeless Shetland Islands, where houses are built right into the churning surf. The first seven seasons featured Douglas Henshall as the lead character, widowed police detective Jimmy Pérez. Henshall left the show after Season 7, replaced by Ashley Jensen as Ruth Calder, a Shetland native who reluctantly returns from the big city to pursue a case, then ends up staying. I’ll go out on a heretical limb here and say that I prefer the brusque Calder to Pérez, who was your basic soulful dude detective with a doomed love life. But Shetland is one sweater-detective series in which the detectives themselves are less interesting than the characters in each season’s mystery, people whose rustic lives acquire a tragic stature against the backdrop of their bleakly beautiful island.\\n\\nStreaming on BritBox.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nRelated From Slate The 40 Greatest Stand-Alone TV Episodes of All Time Read More\\n\\nWallander (4 seasons)\\n\\nEach of the brief seasons of this British series, starring Kenneth Branagh, adapts a novel from Henning Mankell’s beloved Wallander series, following the investigations of a detective inspector in the small town of Ystad, Sweden. Wallander’s cases tend to be less fantastical and convoluted than those of other sweater detectives, and Mankell often engaged with social issues like immigration and the drug trade. Nevertheless, Wallander’s pensive disposition and weirdly existential personal life (his father, an artist, has Alzheimer’s and paints the same picture of a grouse over and over again) make him a sweater detective at heart.\\n\\nStreaming on BritBox.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe Truth Will Out (2 seasons)\\n\\nThe rare sweater-detective series that’s consistently funny as well as broody, this Swedish show centers on a cold-case unit headed by Peter Wendel (Robert Gustafsson), a detective recently returned to work after a three-year sick leave. His boss relegates Peter to a dim basement office staffed by departmental rejects, including a garrulous clerk, a detective under investigation for theft, and her accuser, who wants to talk only about his plans to become a real estate agent. Call it the Slow Horses of Swedish cop shows. Nevertheless, this crew turns out to be surprisingly good at reinvestigating claims made by a serial killer, much to the dismay of those who would prefer to let sleeping dogs lie. In darker counterpart to this main plot is Peter’s growing suspicion that his brother, said to have taken his own life, was in fact murdered, as well as the mental illness that increasingly impinges on Peter’s ability to investigate anything at all.\\n\\nStreaming on Acorn TV.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMare of Easttown (1 season)\\n\\nBereft of cliffs and anything in the way of memorable knitwear (Mare is more of a sweats-and-parka girl), this HBO series, starring Kate Winslet, might not initially seem like sweater-detective fare. But with its loving attention to Mare Sheehan’s largely working-class Pennsylvania community, shaken by the murder of a teenage mother, the show is clearly influenced by Broadchurch and Happy Valley, which in turn owed much to the tone and approach of The Killing. No stranger to private tragedy (her son killed himself), Mare doggedly investigates the murder along with a year-old disappearance, pursuing a solution that will tear apart both Easttown and her own closest ties.\\n\\nStreaming on Max.\\n\\nRelated From Slate Mare of Easttown’s Creator on Its Final Shocking Twist Read More\\n\\nFortitude (3 seasons)\\n\\nSadly, this British series, set on a remote outpost in Arctic Norway populated by fishermen and the staff of a scientific research base, doesn’t appear to be streaming anywhere, but if you ever get the chance to watch it, especially its first season, jump. Reveling in a snow-bound claustrophobia reminiscent of Trapped, Fortitude depicts the chaos that ensues as the close-knit community experiences a rash of strange deaths and disappearances. But what really makes that first season indelible is the delectable performance of Stanley Tucci as an urbane American detective chief inspector for Scotland Yard, called in to investigate the murders, to the chagrin of “Sheriff Dan” (Richard Dormer), the local lawman, who falsely believes he can contain things as the locals’ behavior—and the crimes—gets weirder and weirder.'}],\n",

       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': 'His selection is being celebrated by MAGA world, while it feels like the latest scare in Democrats’ nightmare.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump announced Sunday night that Kash Patel had tapped Dan Bongino to be second-in-command at the FBI, after the Senate confirmed Patel as the bureau’s new director last week.\\n\\nBongino, like many new leaders across the Trump Administration including Patel, represents a radical departure from tradition for his role. The FBI deputy director, which does not require Senate confirmation, is typically an active agent with significant operational expertise and experience—something Patel reportedly agreed to maintain before selecting Bongino.\\n\\nBongino, a 50-year-old former Secret Service agent turned conservative-media commentator, is instead most well known for his outspoken support for Trump and his frequent spreading of misinformation, including about the FBI.\\n\\nHere’s what to know about Bongino.\\n\\nA former police officer and Secret Service agent\\n\\nBongino started his career as a cadet then officer with the New York City Police Department from 1995 to 1999, according to a previous campaign website. He joined the Secret Service in 1999 as a special agent, starting in the New York Field Office and assigned with investigating federal crimes such as “protective intelligence, computer crimes, bank fraud, credit card fraud and counterfeiting.” Bongino left the field office in 2002 to become an instructor at the Secret Service Training Academy in Beltsville, Md.\\n\\nIn 2006, Bongino joined the Presidential Protective Division, serving during the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Bongino then transferred to the Baltimore Field Office in 2010, before leaving in May 2011 to run for office.\\n\\nHe has published multiple books on his time with the agency, including Life Inside the Bubble: Why a Top-Ranked Secret Service Agent Walked Away from It All (2013) and The Fight: A Secret Service Agent’s Inside Account of Security Failings and the Political Machine (2016), drawing criticism for allegedly exaggerating his importance and proximity to power and “hijacking the Secret Service brand” to gain attention.\\n\\nRan for Congress three times, unsuccessfully\\n\\nIn 2012, Bongino ran for the U.S. Senate in Maryland, winning the Republican primary but ultimately losing by a landslide to Democratic incumbent Ben Cardin. He ran at the time on cutting taxes, growing jobs, and his “heartfelt desire to shake up an unquestionably broken political system and culture.”\\n\\nIn 2014, Bongino ran against Democratic incumbent John Delaney to represent Maryland’s 6th congressional district in the U.S. House, but he narrowly lost.\\n\\nBongino then moved to Florida in 2015 for a “non-emergency family situation,” raising speculation that he would run for Congress again, to represent the state’s 18th district. In 2016, he ran instead in the GOP primary for Florida’s 19th district, which was an open solid-red seat, but he finished third.\\n\\nSurvived Hodgkin’s lymphoma\\n\\nIn September 2020, Bongino announced a 7-cm. growth had been found in his neck. The next month, he said he had to undergo an operation to remove the growth, and he later disclosed post-operation that it “looks like lymphoma”—a type of blood cancer. On Oct. 16, Bongino said he’d been diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, though he added that “there’s a treatment plan.” In an interview with Megyn Kelly in 2024, Bongino said he was “two years clean in remission.”\\n\\n‘My entire life right now is about owning the libs’\\n\\nBongino began a new career in media after his unsuccessful run for Congress in 2015, starting a podcast in his basement called The Renegade Republican (since renamed The Dan Bongino Show). By 2016—with episodes such as “Debunking Liberal Spin About Democrats and Inner Cities,” “How The Media Fooled America,” “The Truth About Trade Wars” and “I’m Disgusted by Republicans for Hillary”—his audience was reaching millions.\\n\\nBongino’s popularity and brash style earned him a contract in 2018 with NRATV, the National Rifle Association’s short-lived online video channel. “My entire life right now is about owning the libs,” Bongino famously said during a segment in October 2018.\\n\\nOver the years, Trump took notice of Bongino, frequently posting on social media about his comments. “Did you see what Bongino said?” Trump reportedly told a confidant after seeing Bongino as a contributor on Fox News in 2018, according to the Daily Beast. “He’s so right, he’s just so right about it all. You have to see it.”\\n\\nIn 2019, Bongino launched Bongino Report, an aggregator of right-wing media headlines intended as a pro-Trump alternative to Drudge Report.\\n\\nBongino’s Facebook page grew to generate “more monthly engagement than the pages of The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN combined,” according to a 2020 New York Times report.\\n\\nIn 2021, Bongino was tapped by talk radio and podcast network Cumulus Media to take over the late Rush Limbaugh’s slot. That same year he also began hosting a Fox News weekend program, Unfiltered With Dan Bongino, as well as a five-part series on cancel culture called Canceled in the USA on Fox Nation. (Bongino left the Fox News network in April 2023, citing failed contract negotiations.) Bongino continues to host his podcast and radio show, though Trump said in his post announcing Bongino’s FBI appointment that it is “something he is willing and prepared to give up in order to serve.”\\n\\nA misinformation ‘superspreader’\\n\\nBongino has been criticized for promoting misinformation and conspiracy theories on a range of subjects.\\n\\nA critic of vaccine mandates and masking (which he called “useless”) during the COVID-19 pandemic, Bongino was permanently banned from YouTube in January 2022 for violating its policies against pandemic-related misinformation, and Google pulled its ad services from his website. His podcast also went on hiatus in October 2021 after he publicly threatened to leave Cumulus Media over its vaccine mandate, despite being vaccinated himself. The show went back on air less than two weeks later, however, without Cumulus changing its policy.\\n\\nPerhaps most famously, in the weeks after Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election, Bongino promoted in dozens of social media posts and podcast clips the theory that the election had been stolen from Trump. An analysis by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue and Politico found that Bongino was among the biggest high-profile right-wing figures to push the false narrative of voter fraud, and the New York Times named him a top “misinformation ‘superspreader.’”\\n\\n“Ladies and gentlemen, as I said to you, there’s nothing to concede because this race isn’t over,” Bongino addressed listeners in a Nov. 9, 2020, episode titled “Resist” discussing the election results. “We aren’t going anywhere. We need that rally. We need to see the commander-in-chief, still the president of the United States, and this race isn’t over. And even if it is later, it’ll send the message that Trump isn’t going away.” Ashli Babbitt, the 35-year-old woman who was fatally shot while storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, had retweeted Bongino 50 times in the year before she died, according to an analysis by NPR.\\n\\nBongino has condemned the violence of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, though he also called on Trump to pardon those arrested and charged with crimes related to the riot.\\n\\nBongino has also been criticized for advancing other “conspiracy theories” related to the 2016 and 2024 elections, the Mueller investigation, the Nord Stream pipelines, federal disaster response, and more.\\n\\nIn a post on Facebook in October, Bongino claimed, “I’m batting 1000 with ‘conspiracy theories.’ You can take this one to the bank,” alongside a clip from his show in which he promised that Democrats “are not going to peacefully step aside if they lose in November. There is absolutely zero chance.”\\n\\nHas called the FBI ‘irredeemably corrupt’\\n\\nThe agency that Bongino will soon lead has long been the subject of a number of his claims and criticisms.\\n\\nBongino has baselessly suggested that the FBI played and covered up a role in the pipe bombs placed outside the DNC and RNC headquarters in January 2021, and he’s questioned the integrity of the agency’s investigations into the assassination attempts on Trump in 2024.\\n\\nIn 2021, he accused members of the FBI (as well as the CIA) of “unquestionably” trying to “rig” the 2016 and 2020 elections. “A corrupted intelligence community, in conjunction with a corrupt media, will eat this country like a cancer from the inside out,” Bongino said during a podcast taping, according to the New Yorker. “This is why I’m really hoping Donald Trump runs in 2024,” he said. “He’s the best candidate suited to clean house. Because if we don’t clean house the Republic is gone.”\\n\\nBongino repeated the idea that “it’s time to clean house” at the FBI again in 2022, during a monologue on Fox News, in which he claimed that the agency is “irredeemably corrupt” and has been “abusing its power and eroding Americans’ trust for decades now.” In the segment, Bongino outlined how he believed the FBI has a “long history of failures” in its law-enforcement duties while it’s been busy pursuing politically-motivated investigations against Trump.\\n\\nThe monologue came after the FBI executed a search warrant at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence, which Bongino called “inexcusable” and called for the firing of “everyone involved.” (He also called for the abolition of the FISA court as well as reform of the FOIA process.)\\n\\nIn another Fox News segment that same month, Bongino said: “Then you say, well, it’s just a few bad apples. Is it? … But it’s not one bad apple. It’s a rotten orchard.”'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Steven Dettelbach, one of only two people ever to be confirmed by the Senate to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, stepped down from the ATF last month, ahead of Donald Trump starting his second term, and there was uncertainty about who, if anyone, the Republican would chose to succeed him.\\n\\nEvidently, the president has settled on an unexpected choice. NBC News reported:\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump’s newly-confirmed FBI director, Kash Patel, is expected to take on another top law enforcement role in the administration as head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to a White House official and two other sources familiar with the plan. Patel’s appointment could be made official as soon as next week with a swearing-in ceremony, the sources said.\\n\\nIn case this isn’t obvious, to serve as ATF director requires Senate confirmation, and Patel hasn’t even been nominated for this second position. If Patel is sworn in anyway, it would presumably be in acting capacity — unless the president and his team have some kind of fresh extrajudicial power grab in mind.\\n\\nNBC News’ report added that ATF, a law enforcement agency housed in the Department of Justice, “is responsible for enforcing federal laws regarding the illegal use, sale and trafficking of firearms and explosives, as well as the illegal diversion of alcohol and tobacco products.”\\n\\nLeading the agency is a difficult and full-time job. If the NBC News report is correct, it will nevertheless be done by an official who has earned a reputation as a prolific conspiracy theorist who already has a difficult and full-time job leading the FBI.\\n\\nIt’s also worth emphasizing for context that while Patel had no meaningful experience at the FBI before Trump tapped him to lead the bureau, Patel also has no background whatsoever at the ATF or with its work. Or put another way, nominating the conspiracy theorist to lead the bureau was ridiculous, and asking him to also simultaneously lead the ATF adds insult to injury.\\n\\nBut let’s not brush past the fact that Trump keeps asking assorted officials to take on multiple jobs at the same time.\\n\\nAs we recently discussed, we saw some of this in the Republican’s first term. In early 2017, for example, the president tapped then-Rep. Mick Mulvaney to serve as the White House budget director. In time, the South Carolinian also led the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And served as White House chief of staff. And became the U.S. special envoy to Northern Ireland.\\n\\nTo be sure, it became amusing to see just how many hats Mulvaney ended up wearing, but what was especially notable about his tenure was that he occasionally wore more than one hat at the same time. For most of 2018, for example, he led both the Office of Management and Budget and the CFPB. In 2019, Mulvaney was both the White House budget director and the president’s chief of staff.\\n\\nIt’s apparently now happening again. Patel will reportedly lead the FBI and the ATF. Marco Rubio, meanwhile, is the secretary of state, but Trump also put him in charge of the National Archives in an acting capacity.\\n\\nDoug Collins was named the secretary of veterans affairs and the acting leader of the Office of Special Counsel and the Office of Government Ethics. Russell Vought is the White House budget director, but that didn’t stop Trump from also tapping Vought to serve as the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, mirroring Mulvaney’s dual responsibilities from eight years ago. Ric Grenell was recently named the interim director of the Kennedy Center, which is a job he’ll apparently do while also working as the “Presidential Envoy for Special Missions,” working in “some of the hottest spots around the World, including Venezuela and North Korea.”\\n\\nIt’s hard not to wonder who’ll soon be added to this growing list.\\n\\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"In early September 2024, federal prosecutors presented evidence of a striking and unexpected controversy. The Justice Department had apparently uncovered evidence of a Russia-backed media network funding and directing a scheme that sent millions of dollars to prominent right-wing commentators and podcast hosts.\\n\\nAs the scandal unfolded, far-right podcaster Dan Bongino used his own program to extend some advice to his ideological brethren: Those caught up in the mess, Bongino said, should not cooperate with the FBI.\\n\\nSix months later, Donald Trump decided it’d be a good idea to put the far-right media personality in a key leadership post at the FBI. NBC News reported:\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump on Sunday announced the selection of conservative commentator and former Fox News host Dan Bongino to serve as deputy FBI director, filling a position typically held by a career FBI agent with an influential media personality who has called for mass firings at the bureau. Bongino will lead the bureau alongside Kash Patel, who was narrowly confirmed as FBI director by the Senate last week.\\n\\nThe deputy director position is effectively responsible for running the bureau’s day-to-day operations, as The New York Times reported, it is “a complex and grueling job that requires working closely with foreign partners and navigating sensitive investigations.”\\n\\nFor generations, the administrative position has gone to senior agents with extensive FBI experience. According to NBC News’ reporting, this trend was supposed to continue: Patel privately agreed — shortly before the president’s announcement — that the next FBI deputy director would be an active special agent with operational expertise and experience, as well as institutional knowledge and respect within the bureau.\\n\\nIt was against this backdrop that Trump instead chose a podcaster with literally no FBI experience for the job. The fact that Bongino worked as a Secret Service agent and NYPD officer is of interest, but it's also not altogether relevant.\\n\\nWhat’s more, this is not a Senate-confirmed position. The president wants an unqualified conservative media personality to help run the FBI’s operations, and so an unqualified conservative media personality will now help run the FBI’s operations.\\n\\nEven by Trump standards, this is truly bonkers.\\n\\nIn fact, it’s genuinely challenging to know where to start. Do we emphasize how hilarious Trump’s recent focus on “meritocracy“ is in light of decisions like these? Do we focus on Bongino’s failed congressional campaigns, making this an extension of the ongoing “Team of Losers” thesis?\\n\\nHow about the president’s preoccupation with hiring officials with Fox News experience? (According to tallies from The New York Times and Media Matters, Trump has now chosen 20 former Fox hosts and contributors — and counting — to serve on his team.) Or maybe a few paragraphs about Trump vowing to “depoliticize” the FBI while installing someone who once said, “My entire life right now is about owning the libs. That’s it. The libs, because they have shown themselves ... to be pure unadulterated evil”?\\n\\nWhile each of these angles are relevant, more still, however, is the bigger picture: This is a step a president takes when he wants to tear down the FBI and turn it into something new and twisted.\\n\\nTrump tapped an inexperienced and prolific conspiracy theorist to serve as the director of the FBI, at which point he tapped another inexperienced and prolific conspiracy theorist to serve as the deputy director of the FBI. Both men, of course, are also election deniers.\\n\\nAs the aforementioned Times report added, “The combination of Mr. Patel and Mr. Bongino will represent the least experienced leadership pair in the bureau’s history. It is also all but certain to prompt concerns about how the men, who have freely peddled misinformation and embraced partisan politics, will run an agency typically insulated from White House interference.”\\n\\nNBC News’ reporting also noted that Bongino has spent many hours specifically spouting “baseless falsehoods” about the bureau itself, leading current and former FBI feeling “appalled — and extremely concerned for the national security of the country.”\\n\\nI don’t doubt that there will still be an institution called the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but with Patel and Bongino at the helm, it will not be the FBI.\\n\\nBefore 51 Senate Republicans voted to confirm Patel last week, Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said on the chamber’s floor, “If your plan is to destroy the rule of law and turn the Department of Justice into a political weapon that rewards loyalty and punishes dissent, then Kash Patel is the perfect person to lead the FBI.”\\n\\nBongino makes the same problem vastly worse.\"},\n",

Calla Kessler / The Washington Post via Getty Images file\\n\\nBongino is a former Secret Service agent and NYPD officer who mounted several unsuccessful bids for Congress before pivoting his focus to media commentary with the launch of his own website in 2019, podcast and radio show, filling a slot once held by Rush Limbaugh.\\n\\nBongino has never served in the FBI, breaking a longstanding tradition of the role of deputy director being occupied by a career agent of the bureau.\\n\\nIn his role as a leading pro-Trump podcaster, Bongino has advanced baseless theories about the FBI, including a claim earlier this year that the bureau lied when it announced it still had not identified a suspect in the placement of pipe bombs outside of the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee a day before the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.\\n\\nIn January, the FBI released new video of an individual placing one of the bombs near the DNC as part of the bureau\\'s renewed effort to track down a suspect.\\n\\n\"If the video has been sitting in the FBI evidence locker for four years now, it’s almost like someone in the FBI knows the identity of this bomber and that Trump is going to find out,\" Bongino said in a recent podcast episode. He called the bureau\\'s inability to provide a name or other identifying information for the suspect \"the biggest scandal of our time.\"\\n\\nBongino was among that Trump loyalists who perpetuated conspiracies regarding the 2022 search of Trump\\'s Mar-a-Lago property for classified documents, suggesting the search was an attempt by President Joe Biden\\'s administration to assassinate the then-former president.\\n\\n\"EVERYONE involved in this DOJ/FBI abomination, from the management down to the agents, must be immediately terminated when the tyrants are thrown out of office,\" Bongino said in a social media post at the time.\\n\\nBongino will be one of nearly two-dozen former Fox News personnel in Trump’s administration, a list that includes Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Trump similarly staffed his first administration with several of the network’s employees.\\n\\nTwo current FBI officials concerned with Bongino\\'s selection noted to NBC News that the deputy FBI director typically runs the bureau\\'s operations and oversees the special agents that lead its 55 field offices across the country.\\n\\nPrior to Trump\\'s post announcing Bongino\\'s appointment, NBC News obtained a memo from the FBI Agents Association that appeared to suggest the conservative podcaster was not qualified for his new position. Without naming any specific person, the memo pushed for a deputy director who was part of the bureau.\\n\\n“The FBI Deputy Director should continue to be an on-board, active Special Agent — as has been the case for 117 years for many compelling reasons, including operational expertise and experience, as well as the trust of our Special Agent population,” the statement read in part.\\n\\nFormer Justice Department officials, including Attorney General William Barr, who served in Trump\\'s first administration, also expressed concerns over Patel\\'s lack of experience in the bureau.\\n\\nPatel and Bongino\\'s leadership of the FBI will come at a time of significant turnover. The head of the Washington Field Office — which oversaw the sprawling Jan. 6 probe — was forced out, as were six of the FBI’s most senior executives and multiple heads of FBI field offices around the country.\\n\\nDemocrats have accused Patel of secretly orchestrating the firings of career civil servants at the bureau. In a social media post following the claim — detailed in a letter by Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., to the Justice Department Inspector General — Erika Knight, a spokesperson for Patel, did not directly address Durbin’s letter but decried what she described as a “false narrative.”\\n\\n“Kash Patel is a highly qualified national security expert who has been fully transparent with the American people throughout this process and has demonstrated the integrity and leadership needed for this role,” she wrote. “The Senate should confirm him without delay.”\\n\\nTrump said this month that he plans to \"fire some\" FBI personnel who worked on the Capitol riot cases amid concerns of mass layoffs at the bureau as part of Elon Musk\\'s Department of Government Efficiency\\'s efforts to drastically cut the size of the federal workforce.'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-24T13:46:33',\n",
       "   'content': 'WASHINGTON (AP) — Dan Bongino, a former U.S. Secret Service agent who ran unsuccessfully for office and gained fame as a conservative pundit with TV shows and a popular podcast, has been chosen to serve as FBI deputy director.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump announced the appointment Sunday night in a post on his Truth Social platform, praising Bongino as “a man of incredible love and passion for our Country.” He called the announcement “great news for Law Enforcement and American Justice.”\\n\\nThe selection places two staunch Trump allies atop the nation’s premier federal law enforcement agency at a time when Democrats have raised alarms that the Republican president could seek to use the FBI to target his adversaries. Bongino would serve under Kash Patel, a Trump loyalist who was sworn in as FBI director at the White House on Friday and who has signaled his intent to reshape the bureau, including by relocating hundreds of employees from its Washington headquarters and placing greater emphasis on the FBI’s traditional crime-fighting duties.\\n\\nThe deputy director serves as the FBI’s second-in-command and is traditionally a career agent responsible for the bureau’s day-to-day law enforcement operations. The position does not require Senate confirmation. But Bongino, like Patel, has never served in the FBI, raising questions about their experience level when the U.S. is facing escalating national security threats.\\n\\nNatalie Bara, president of the FBI Agents Association, wrote in an internal newsletter to members sent Sunday before Bongino’s selection was announced that Patel had agreed during a January meeting with her that the FBI deputy director “should continue to be an on-board, active Special Agent as has been the case for 117 years for many compelling reasons, including operational expertise and experience, as well as the trust of our Special Agent population.”\\n\\nThe two are inheriting an FBI gripped by turmoil as the Justice Department over the past month has forced out a group of senior bureau officials and made a highly unusual demand for the names of thousands of agents who participated in investigations related to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\\n\\nREAD MORE: Patel’s roster of foreign clients draws scrutiny over conflicting interests with the FBI\\n\\nBongino served on the presidential details for then-Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, before becoming a popular right-wing figure. He became one of the leading personalities in the Make America Great Again political movement to spread false information about the 2020 election, which Trump and allies have continued to maintain was marred by widespread fraud even though such claims have been widely rejected as false by judges and former Trump attorney general William Barr.\\n\\nFor a few years following Rush Limbaugh’s death in 2021, he was chosen for a radio show on the same time slot of the famous commentator.\\n\\nBongino worked for the New York Police Department for several years in the 1990s before joining the Secret Service. He began doing commentary on Fox News more than a decade ago, and had a Saturday night show with the network from 2021 to 2023. He is now a host of The Dan Bongino Show, one of the most popular podcasts, according to Spotify.\\n\\nBongino ran for a U.S. Senate seat in Maryland in 2012 and for congressional seats in 2014 and 2016 in Maryland and Florida, after moving in 2015. He lost the three races.\\n\\nDuring an interview last fall, Bongino asked Trump to commit to forming a commission to reform the Secret Service, calling it a “failed” agency and criticizing it for the two assassination attempts last year.\\n\\n“That guy should have been nowhere near you,” Bongino said about the man who authorities say camped outside Trump’s golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida, before he was spotted with a rifle.\\n\\nDuring the same interview, Trump praised the Secret Service agent who saw the rifle’s barrel coming out of a bush.\\n\\nPatel and Bongino will succeed the two acting FBI leaders, Brian Driscoll and Rob Kissane, who have led the bureau since the departure in January of former Director Christopher Wray, who was appointed by Trump in 2017 and held the job for the next seven years before resigning at the end of the Biden administration to make way for his chosen successor.\\n\\nAssociated Press writer Ali Swenson in New York contributed to this report.'},\n",

       "   'title': 'Kash Patel Has Been Confirmed as FBI Director and the MAGAfication of Federal Law Enforcement Is Complete',\n",
       "   'time': '2025-02-21T00:21:00',\n",
       "   'content': 'The MAGAfication of federal law enforcement became complete on Thursday when Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski were the only two Republican senators with the cojones to vote against confirming rancid social-media flotsam Kash Patel as director of the FBI. His nomination passed, 51–49, outside of Pete Hegseth, the closest the Senate came to not buying one of these lemons. From The Washington Post:\\n\\nPatel, a former assistant public defender and federal prosecutor, has been a staunch defender of Trump’s in recent years. And while FBI leaders in the modern era have sought to keep some distance between themselves and presidents, Patel would appear to be the first director to have so closely allied himself with the commander-in-chief who appointed him.\\n\\nI’d correct the record to mention L. Patrick Gray, the guy that Nixon slotted in as acting director largely to bury the FBI investigation of Watergate, but damn, Washington Post, don’t make me nostalgic for the days of independent FBI director J. Edgar Hoover.\\n\\nPatel is independent if, by independent, you mean “independent of reality” or “independent of Constitutional prerogatives.” The man is a Q-anon-adjacent Trumper dedicated to defending this president from the demons that dance and sing in their own vengeful minds. And he has friends, too.\\n\\nAnd perhaps no group is happier than the coterie of suspended or former agents Patel has connected with in recent years. They call themselves “The Suspendables”: victims of what they deride as the FBI’s weaponization against conservatives, and say they were punished for political differences and whistleblowing. They’ve built an online following through podcast appearances, social media and conservative news outlets where they’ve trumpeted their complaints. Critics dismiss them as disgruntled ex-employees peddling unsubstantiated claims of political bias. Patel’s ties to them have only stoked the deep unease Democrats have expressed about his nomination.\\n\\nThis vote stoked my unease about what happened back in 2016 just before the election when the New York field office (allegedly) blackjacked James Comey into announcing the reopening of the probe into Her E-Mails. And I suspect my unease will be regularly stoked over and over again as long as this guy is in charge of the FBI. Stoked Unease is the order of the day.'}],\n",

       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': 'Hamas says no Gaza ceasefire talks unless Israel releases prisoners\\n\\n3 hours ago David Gritten BBC News\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\nHamas says talks with Israel about further steps in the Gaza ceasefire deal are conditional on Palestinian prisoners being freed as agreed. Israel said on Sunday it was delaying the release of more than 600 Palestinians in return for six living and four dead hostages who had been freed, accusing Hamas of repeated violations including \"humiliating\" handover ceremonies. A senior Hamas official said the decision exposed the entire agreement to \"grave danger\" and called on mediators, especially the US, to pressure Israel. The deal\\'s first phase and temporary six-week truce is set to expire on Saturday but indirect negotiations on the second phase and an end to the war have not yet begun.\\n\\nUN Secretary General António Guterres warned that the ceasefire was \"precarious\" and that a resumption of hostilities must be avoided at all costs. He also called for the \"dignified release of all remaining hostages\".\\n\\nOn Saturday - the start of the sixth and final week of the ceasefire deal\\'s first phase - Hamas released six living Israeli hostages. As with many of the previous handovers, five of them were led onto stages beside armed fighters before being transferred to the Red Cross and then taken to Israel. Later, Hamas posted a video of two other hostages in a vehicle watching one of the handover ceremonies and appearing to plead with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to get them out too. A forum representing the hostages\\' families condemned the video as a \"sickening display of cruelty\". There was already fury in Israel after Hamas returned the bodies of four hostages earlier in the week, including those of Shiri Bibas and her two young sons Ariel and Kfir, who were abducted during the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel. It emerged on Friday that Hamas had handed over the remains of a Palestinian woman rather than those of Ms Bibas. The group said there had been a mistake and transferred Ms Bibas\\'s body later that day. Israeli authorities also said a post-mortem had shown that Ariel and Kfir\\'s captors killed the boys \"with their bare hands\", contradicting Hamas\\'s claim that they died in an Israeli air strike. Israel was scheduled to free 620 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the 10 hostages. More than 400 were Gazans detained by Israeli forces during the war, while 50 of the prisoners were serving life sentences in Israeli jails. They had reportedly already boarded buses at a prison in the occupied West Bank when the order came to suspend their release while Netanyahu consulted ministers. In the early hours of Sunday, the prime minister\\'s office said the release would be postponed \"in light of Hamas\\'s repeated violations, including the ceremonies that humiliate our hostages and the cynical exploitation of our hostages for propaganda purposes\". \"It has been decided to delay the release of terrorists that was planned for yesterday until the release of the next hostages has been assured, and without the humiliating ceremonies.\"\\n\\nReuters Israeli hostages Omer Shem Tov, Eliya Cohen and Omer Wenkert were paraded by armed fighters on a stage in Nuseirat before being handed over to the Red Cross\\n\\nHamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other countries - denounced Israel\\'s decision as a \"blatant violation\" of the deal and warned US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators that there could be no talks on extending the ceasefire until the prisoners were released. \"We have conveyed a clear and strong message to the mediators - we cannot continue discussing any further steps if these 620 Palestinians are not released,\" Hamas political bureau member Basem Naim said in an interview with Al Jazeera on Monday. Asked if the scheduled release of the bodies of another four Israeli hostages on Thursday could be affected, he replied that \"all options are on the table\". \"Before going to the next step, we have to be sure that the past step [will happen],\" he added. \"Netanyahu is clearly sending strong messages that he is intentionally sabotaging the deal, he is preparing the atmosphere for returning back to the war. Therefore, what are the guarantees that he might take the other four bodies and again not release the agreed-upon number of Palestinians, plus the 620 Palestinians?\" Naim said Hamas had discussed Israel\\'s complaints about the hostage handover ceremonies, but denied they had been humiliating and alleged that Israeli authorities had mistreated Palestinian prisoners before they were released. The White House backed Israel\\'s decision to delay the prisoner release, saying it was an \"appropriate response\" to what it called the \"barbaric treatment\" of hostages by Hamas. But President Donald Trump\\'s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said he would travel to the region this week with the aim of getting \"an extension of phase one\". \"We\\'re hopeful that we have the proper time... to begin phase two, and finish it off and get more hostages released,\" he told CNN on Sunday.\\n\\nEPA Palestinians were waiting in Ramallah for the prisoners early on Sunday when Israeli authorities delayed their release'},\n",

A beaming Shem Tov even kissed two militants next to him on the head and blew kisses to the crowd.\\n\\nFreed Israeli hostage Eliya Cohen gestures from a van as he arrives at Beilinson hospital in Petah Tikva, Israel, after he was released from Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip, Saturday, Feb. 22, 2025.

Shem Tov\\'s grandmother ululated in joy, shrieking, \"Omer, my joy! My life!\" as she saw him.\\n\\nCohen\\'s fiance, Ziv Abud, avoided capture by hiding under a pile of bodies the night of the concert. Abud, whose story was told in See It Now Studio\\'s documentary \"We Will Dance Again,\" told the Daily Telegraph that she knows the man who could come out will be very different from the person who was snatched by Hamas terrorists more than 16 months ago.\\n\\n\"We will start with the healing and go from there,\" Abud said ahead of his release. \"I want to believe that he is still the same Eliya, that he will love the same things we used to love. We loved to travel. We loved to dance. But we will see. He has had all this time of people telling him what he must do. When he is home he will need to do what he wants to do. And I will be with him, of course.\"\\n\\nThe three men were put in Red Cross vehicles that then headed for Israel. The Israeli military said the three were in their custody and would undergo an initial medical assessment before being reunited with their families.\\n\\nFreed Israeli hostage Omer Wenkert, gestures from a military helicopter as he arrives at Beilinson hospital in Petah Tikva, Israel, after he was released from Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip, Saturday, Feb. 22, 2025.

You have no idea how much I dreamt of you,\" he said. His father, Malki Shem Tov, told public broadcaster Kan his son was held alone after the first 50 days and lost 37 pounds while in captivity.\\n\\nEarlier Saturday, two other hostages — Tal Shoham, 40, and Avera Mengistu, 38 — were freed. Arriving in Israel, both were taken to medical centers for examination.\\n\\nMengistu, an Ethiopian-Israeli, entered Gaza on his own in 2014. His family told Israeli media he has struggled with mental health issues. Watching the handover on Israeli media, Mengistu\\'s family broke out into a Hebrew song, \"Here is the Light,\" as they saw him for the first time in more than a decade.\\n\\n\"This is an unforgettable moment, where all emotions are rapidly mixing together. Our Tal is with us,\" Shoham\\'s family said in a statement, calling for a deal the be reached for the release of all those still captive. Shoham\\'s wife, two young children, and three other relatives who were abducted with him were freed in a November 2023 exchange. \"There is a window of opportunity; we must not miss it.\"\\n\\nFreed Israeli hostage Tal Shoham waves from a van as he arrives at Beilinson hospital in Petah Tikva, Israel, Saturday, Feb. 22, 2025.

The Bedouin Israeli crossed on his own into Gaza in 2015. His family has told Israeli media he was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia.\\n\\nThe release of over 600 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel — the largest one-day prisoner release in the ceasefire\\'s first phase — was delayed, apparently for Israeli security consultations on Saturday evening.\\n\\nAmong those set to be released is Nael Barghouti, 67. He has spent 45 years in Israeli jails, more than any other Palestinian. He was first arrested in 1978 for killing an Israeli bus driver. He was released in a prisoner exchange deal in October 2011, then rearrested in 2014 on grounds that he violated his release terms. According to the current exchange agreement, freed prisoners convicted of killing Israelis must be deported, leaving Barghouti unable to return to his home in the West Bank.\\n\\nRemains of Shiri Bibas returned, family says\\n\\nThe latest hostage exchange is going ahead after tensions mounted over a grisly and heart-wrenching dispute triggered this week when Hamas initially handed over the wrong body for Shiri Bibas, an Israeli mother of two young boys abducted by militants.\\n\\nThe remains that Hamas transferred with her sons\\' bodies on Thursday were later determined to be those of an unidentified Palestinian woman. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed revenge for \"a cruel and malicious violation,\" while Hamas suggested it had been a mistake.\\n\\nOn Friday night, the small militant group believed to have been holding Bibas and her sons — the Palestinian Mujahedeen Brigades — said it handed over a second body. On Saturday morning, Bibas\\' family said Israeli forensic authorities had confirmed the remains were hers.\\n\\nA woman mourns in a memorial for deceased hostages Shiri Bibas, her two children, Ariel and Kfir and Oded Lifshitz at \\'Hostages Square\\', where Israelis are gathering while waiting for the release of six hostages in Gaza, in Tel Aviv, Israel, Saturday Feb. 22, 2025. Oded Balilty / AP\\n\\n\"For 16 months we sought certainty, and now that it\\'s here, it brings no comfort, though we hope it marks the beginning of closure,\" the family said.\\n\\nThe dispute over the body\\'s identity raised new doubt about the ceasefire deal, which has paused over 15 months of war but is nearing the end of its first phase. Negotiations over a second phase, in which Hamas would release dozens more hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal, are likely to be even more difficult.\\n\\nFirst phase of ceasefire set to end next week\\n\\nHamas has said it will also release four more bodies next week, completing the first phase of the ceasefire. If that plan is carried out, Hamas would retain about 60 hostages, about half of whom are believed to be alive.\\n\\nYael Alexander, whose son Edan is thought to be the last living American hostage, said the situation is a \"nightmare.\"\\n\\n\"If suddenly they decided \\'OK, it\\'s not working, let\\'s stop and that\\'s it, no releases of hostages, this will be a disaster for us the families,\" Alexander said.\\n\\nThe statement from the Bibas family said \"there is no more important goal\" than the release of the remaining hostages.\\n\\nHamas has said it won\\'t release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu, with the full backing of the Trump administration, says he\\'s committed to destroying Hamas\\' military and governing capacities and returning all the hostages, goals widely seen as mutually exclusive.\\n\\nTrump\\'s proposal to remove about 2 million Palestinians from Gaza so the U.S. can own and rebuild it has thrown the ceasefire into further doubt. His idea has been welcomed by Netanyahu but universally rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries.\\n\\nTrump said Friday that he was \"a little surprised\" by rejections of the proposal by Egypt and Jordan and that he would not impose it.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell you, the way to do it is my plan. I think that\\'s the plan that really works. But I\\'m not forcing it. I\\'m just going to sit back and recommend it,\" Trump said in a Fox News interview.\\n\\nIsrael\\'s military offensive killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\\'s Health Ministry, which doesn\\'t distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence.\\n\\nThe offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble. At its height, the war displaced 90% of Gaza\\'s population. Many have returned to their homes to find nothing left and no way of rebuilding.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve had enough of war,\" Wahiba Muheisen, who lost her husband and three sons and now lives in a tent beside her ruined home, told CBS News. \"I\\'ve lost so much.\"'},\n",

But that hope has faded quickly since Mr. Trump suggested a plan to force Gaza\\'s entire population out and to \"take over\" the decimated Palestinian territory to develop it as a vacation destination.\\n\\nMr. Trump said the roughly 2.3 million Palestinians should be moved to Egypt and Jordan, apparently to make way for investors to move in and \"just clean out the whole thing.\"\\n\\nThe president\\'s suggestion sent a shockwave of confusion and anger sweeping across the Arab nations that surround Israel, and beyond.\\n\\n\"In Egypt, we have warned since the beginning of the crisis that what was happening was an attempt to render the Gaza Strip uninhabitable, paving the way for the displacement of the Palestinians,\" Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said several days after Mr. Trump first suggested his plan. \"I state it unequivocally: The displacement of the Palestinian people from their place is an injustice. We cannot condone or be a part of the unjust displacement of Palestinians.\"\\n\\nMeeting earlier this month in Washington with Mr. Trump, Jordan\\'s King Abdullah II, asked about the president\\'s proposal, said Egypt was working on an alternative plan with other Arab countries.\\n\\n\"We will be in Saudi Arabia to discuss how we can work with the president and with the United States,\" Abdullah told reporters. \"Let\\'s wait until the Egyptians can come and present it to the [U.S.] president, and not get ahead of ourselves.\"\\n\\nOn Friday, a meeting to discuss that alternative proposal for Gaza\\'s future will take place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. While Mr. Trump has continued to insist that Egypt and Jordan will rehome the Palestinians from Gaza, his administration has also said it remains open to other suggestions.\\n\\n\"Right now, the only one who\\'s stood up and said, \\'I\\'m willing to help do it,\\' is Donald Trump,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an interview last week. \"All these other leaders, they\\'re going to have to step up. If they\\'ve got a better idea, then now is the time.\"\\n\\nAn Egyptian plan for Gaza takes shape\\n\\n\"Egypt is putting together a comprehensive, phased plan that seeks to rehabilitate Gaza,\" Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Tamim Khallaf told CBS News on Wednesday. \"The plan will span several years that would entail sequential phases of removing rubble and reconstruction.\"\\n\\n\"It will be conducted in a way to ensure that Palestinians in Gaza remain in their homeland,\" said Khallaf, adding that the plan \"will be operationally both realistic and workable.\"\\n\\nFunding for the herculean task of rebuilding Gaza will be a vital component of any plan for after the war. As of January, the U.N. and World Bank estimated that 72% of the territory\\'s housing, 84% of its health facilities and 92% of its primary roads had been damaged or totally destroyed, and the bombing continued for another month from that point.\\n\\nKhallaf told CBS News that Egypt was \"in talks with the United Nations, through the U.N. Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza, to jointly organize an international conference in Egypt for early recovery and reconstruction in Gaza, which will be essential to provide emergency relief activities and secure necessary funds to see the plan come to fruition and restore life back to Gaza.\"\\n\\nThe plan being discussed in Riyadh is expected to be officially endorsed at an Arab summit scheduled for March 4 in Cairo. The plan is also expected to garner backing from further afield. Many U.S. allies in Europe have firmly rejected Mr. Trump\\'s call to relocate Gaza\\'s population, but there has been no other offer of an alternative.\\n\\nSpeaking Wednesday next to Spain\\'s prime minister after they met in Madrid, el-Sissi said the leaders had \"emphasized the importance of the international community\\'s support and adoption of the reconstruction plan for the Gaza Strip, that does not involve the forcible displacement of the Palestinian people — again, without the displacement of the Palestinian people — from their land they so dearly cherish, and their ancestral homeland they will never abandon, and that ensures the immediate initiation of relief and early recovery operations.\"\\n\\nPalestinians are seen in the Jabalia Refugee Camp, in the north of the Gaza Strip, amid the rubble of buildings destroyed by Israeli attacks during the war with Hamas, Feb. 20, 2025, amid a ceasefire. Mahmoud Hamda/Anadolu/Getty\\n\\nEgypt has grappled for a post-war solution for Gaza that would be acceptable to all parties since the conflict was sparked by Hamas\\' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack on Israel.\\n\\nIt\\'s unclear how much support a unified Arab stance, even with broader international support, might garner from Mr. Trump or his close ally, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Without their backing, it\\'s difficult to envision any proposal coming to fruition.\\n\\n\"Generational healing between Palestinians and Israelis is possible but can only transpire when Palestinians live in an independent state of their own,\" Khallaf told CBS News. \"We look forward to working with the U.S. administration in achieving the long-awaited peace in the region.\"'},\n",

       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': 'In the weeks since President Trump\\'s return to office, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, long a target of conservatives, landed in the crosshairs of Elon Musk\\'s DOGE, or Department of Government Efficiency.\\n\\nAs a watchdog agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, is tasked with protecting consumers from financial fraud and shady lending practices. Musk has criticized the agency, which would oversee one of his new ventures. Now its head has been fired and workers have been told to stay home. Doors have been locked and all work has ceased.\\n\\nRohit Chopra, the fired head — who previously served at the Federal Trade Commission under Mr. Trump during his first term in office — said he sees the targeting of the CFPB as \"suspicious\"; It\\'s a small agency that oversees some of the biggest and most powerful companies out there, including big banks and tech companies moving into financial technology.\\n\\n\"They would want a situation where the agency is a lapdog rather than a watchdog,\" Chopra said.\\n\\nA conflict of interest for Musk?\\n\\nMr. Trump, in the Oval Office earlier this month, said it was his goal to fully eliminate the CFPB \"because we\\'re trying to get rid of waste fraud and abuse.\" Getting rid of waste, fraud and abuse is a job the president handed to Musk and DOGE.\\n\\nBut eliminating an agency that regulates tech companies creates a potential for conflicts of interest for Musk, especially given the secrecy around DOGE — something Musk refutes.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know of a case where an organization has been more transparent than the DOGE organization,\" Musk said in the Oval Office on Feb. 11.\\n\\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau 60 Minutes\\n\\nHe said it would be obvious if he was doing something that would benefit one of his companies. However, it\\'s not obvious or transparent to many. A team of young men — connected with DOGE — was given wide access to the bureau\\'s computers, but the American public doesn\\'t know what they\\'re looking for or what they\\'re doing with the access to these files.\\n\\nHanna Hickman, who was a bureau attorney until she was fired less than two weeks ago, said she\\'s heard DOGE workers are camped out in the CFPB basement.\\n\\n\"They\\'ve got papers up on the windows to keep people from looking in. And they\\'ve been accessing data, certainly,\" she said.\\n\\nWhat\\'s on the computers being accessed by DOGE\\n\\nIn recent years the bureau started aggressively policing digital banking companies and products. So it has a lot of information on its computers about them, which is potentially relevant to Musk because he announced that he\\'s starting a new digital payment platform, X Money.\\n\\n\"He\\'s potentially able to gain access to files of his competitors like Venmo and Cash App. He is able to take out the regulator that would\\'ve been the watchdog for his company,\" Hickman said. \"I guess it\\'s easier to fire us than it is to beat us in court.\"\\n\\nA senior White House official told 60 Minutes that Musk is not in the inner workings of the DOGE operations at CFPB. The team working there take their orders from the acting director of the bureau. The official declined to comment on what specifically the team of young men was doing at the bureau.\\n\\nBut according to several sources, the team was granted unprecedented access to the CFPB data systems, including to sensitive bank records — access that normally requires training and background checks.\\n\\nHickman said every employee at CFPB has to go through an extensive background check.\\n\\n\"It includes a detailed run of our background, fingerprints, talking to neighbors and friends to make sure we are who we say we are,\" she said. \"It\\'s a process that takes at least a couple of months before you\\'re hired.\"\\n\\nThe CFPB\\'s chief operating officer gave a sworn declaration saying the DOGE team members were \"provided privacy and cyber security training\" and signed non-disclosure agreements.\\n\\nIn response, the CFPB\\'s chief technologist, who just resigned, wrote that the training alone would be insufficient, noting that there was also \"no mention of DOGE employees undergoing a background investigation.\"\\n\\nEric Halperin and Lorelei Salas 60 Minutes\\n\\nLorelei Salas and Eric Halperin, among the highest-ranking civil servants at the CFPB to leave the bureau, said they were horrified by the idea of people rummaging through the bureau\\'s confidential files. After they were placed on administrative leave, both resigned.\\n\\n\"I\\'m worried about your account number, your social security number being out there,\" Salas said.\\n\\nHalperin, who was in charge of all the bureau\\'s lawsuits on behalf of defrauded consumers, said companies would want the information the CFPB has to stay private.\\n\\n\"We do have information – both proprietary business information, trade secret information and personal identifiable information for consumers that we collected in the course of our work, that was necessary to do our work,\" Halperin said.\\n\\nSalas ran a team of nearly 600 inspectors who examined the books of banks and other financial institutions. She pointed toward the development of artificial intelligence tools used by companies to make decisions about whether or not to give someone a loan. Those algorithms are in the CFPB system, Salas said.\\n\\n\"I think that companies that gave us their financial information and even trade secrets, they will probably be harmed if that information fell into the hands of competitors,\" Salas said.\\n\\nWhat\\'s happening at CFPB now\\n\\nThree hours after the DOGE team swept in on Feb. 7, Musk posted \"CFPB RIP\" on X, alongside a picture of a gravestone. Mr. Trump appointed Russ Vought, an ardent critic of the bureau, as its acting director. Vought announced on X he would stop funding the agency.\\n\\n\"This spigot, long contributing to CFPB\\'s unaccountability, is now being turned off,\" Vought said.\\n\\nSoon, the firings started. Hickman and nearly 200 of her colleagues found out through a mass email.\\n\\n\"We virtually shut down the out-of-control CFPB, escorting radical-left bureaucrats out of the building and locking the doors behind them,\" Mr. Trump said last week. \"What they were doing was so terrible. Where they were spending the money was so terrible.\"\\n\\nLate last week, workers took down the signage at CFPB\\'s headquarters, even though a federal judge imposed a temporary restraining order to stop budget cuts at the bureau and any more firings. A hearing is set for March 3.\\n\\nThe judge\\'s order does not cover those already fired, like Hickman, who says she did not receive any severance pay.\\n\\n\"Under the normal regulations governing a government layoff, we should receive at least 60 days\\' notice, severance, benefits to help us transition into a new role,\" Hickman said. \"It\\'s shocking.\"\\n\\nHickman said her union is fighting back.\\n\\n\"We are looking for all legal avenues to pursue this,\" Hickman said. \"At the end of the day, the administration thinks they can get away with it because they don\\'t think we have any recourse. So I\\'m hoping to prove them wrong.\"\\n\\nShould the CFPB exist?\\n\\nThe watchdog agency, created by Congress after the 2008 financial crisis, was the brainchild of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who\\'s now leading the uphill fight to keep the bureau alive.\\n\\n\"For every person who wants to buy a home without getting scammed, this fight is your fight,\" she said at a recent protest.\\n\\nNorbert Michel, of the Libertarian Cato Institute, agrees with the president that there are too many financial regulatory agencies. He said there are enough regulatory agencies out there and doesn\\'t believe CFPB should have ever been created.\\n\\n\"Consumer protection existed long before we had a CFPB,\" Michel said. \"And if we got rid of it and put everything back to the way that it was, we would still have consumer protection.\"\\n\\nFunctions assigned to the bureau could be assigned under the Federal Trade Commission, he said.\\n\\n\"Their motto is literally on the website, \\'Protecting America\\'s consumers,\\'\" Michel said.\\n\\nStill, the bureau, in its short existence, has recovered over $20 billion for consumers.\\n\\nRohit Chopra 60 Minutes\\n\\nAs of now, CFPB investigations and nearly all lawsuits brought by the agency are frozen. And Chopra says no refund checks to defrauded consumers are going out. He doesn\\'t even know if the bureau really exists right now.\\n\\n\"All I know is that a lot of employees are being told to stay silent and stay home,\" Chopra said.\\n\\nHe also doesn\\'t know where Congress is in all the chaos around the agency. He argues only Congress has the legal authority to shut down an agency it created.\\n\\n\"You can\\'t just say, \\'We\\'re gonna pass these laws to protect consumers,\\' and then act like the agency is a dead fish,\" he said. \"That\\'s not how the Constitution works.\"'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” has been accused of setting off a political firestorm in India after it claimed that the US government had been sending millions of dollars to support the Indian elections.\\n\\nIn a list published on Musk’s social media platform X last week, Doge, a special group that Donald Trump created, claimed that a $21m grant distributed by USAid – the US agency for international development – to help “voter turnout in India” had been cancelled, as part of the president’s sweeping cuts to foreign aid.\\n\\nHowever, records accessed by the Indian Express newspaper have found that no such funds were ever distributed in India and USAid staff have also denied the existence of such a programme.\\n\\nInstead, documents show that USAid had allocated $21m for a non-profit promoting political engagement in neighbouring Bangladesh, amid a draconian crackdown on the political opposition in the country.\\n\\nNonetheless, the claim was seized upon with gusto by Trump, as he sought to discredit USAid and its global development programmes and justify gutting the agency. Musk too has boasted that Doge is “feeding USAid into the wood chipper”.\\n\\nSpeaking at an event in Miami, Trump told the crowds: “What do we need to spend $21m for voter turnout in India for? Wow, $21m. I guess they were trying to get somebody else elected.”\\n\\nThe next day he repeated the allegation at another event, stating that $21m was “going to my friend Prime Minister Modi in India for voter turnout”. He brought it up again on Sunday, as he addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference, this time claiming the figure was “$18m for helping India with its elections” and calling it a “kickback scheme”. “They take advantage of us pretty good,” he added.\\n\\nTrump’s misleading tirade came less than a week after the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, travelled to Washington to meet the new president. Trump called Modi a “great leader” and Modi called Trump a “friend”.\\n\\nTrump’s USAid claims had a seismic impact in India. Modi’s governing rightwing Bharatiya Janata party has long accused international civil society and human rights groups of trying to undermine it, forcing some of the world’s most respected organisations – from Amnesty International to Greenpeace – to shut down their operations in India.\\n\\nSeveral BJP leaders and ministers said Trump’s allegations were proof that international actors were trying to work against the BJP government and interfere in the country’s affairs. Amit Malviya, head of the BJP IT cell, said that Trump “has confirmed that there was indeed an attempt to influence the Indian election and install someone other than Prime Minister Modi”.\\n\\nIndia’s vice-president, Jagdeep Dhankhar, said he was “shocked … the democratic process of this country was sought to be manipulated to dent the purity of our electoral system”, while Sanjeev Sanyal, a member of Modi’s economic advisory council, called USAid the “biggest scam in human history”.\\n\\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

WIRED reporting shows not only which DOGE members are at the NIH but also the sensitive financial system at least some of them have access to.\\n\\nGovernment records reviewed by WIRED show that the four people associated with DOGE have email addresses linking them to the NIH, the federal agency for health research in the US. Internal documents reviewed by WIRED show that three of these employees are employed in the department that controls the NIH’s central electronic business system, which includes finance, budget, procurement, a property-management system, and a grant-tracking system.\\n\\nThe DOGE operatives listed in government records are Luke Farritor, Rachel Riley, Jeremy Lewin, and Clark Minor. Farritor is a former SpaceX intern and current Thiel fellow who also has a working email address linking him to the General Services Administration (GSA). Minor, a former engineer at Palantir, is, as has been reported, the chief information officer of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Lewin is an agency lead at DOGE, according to ProPublica; he has a GSA email and has been named in an affidavit related to a lawsuit as having been involved in the gutting of the US Agency for International Development. Riley works closely with Brad Smith, a former health care entrepreneur and DOGE leader prior to President Donald Trump’s inauguration, according to The New York Times.\\n\\nInternal documents list Farritor, Riley, and Minor as working under the umbrella of the NIH Business System Department. NBS is the central electronic business system of the NIH, according to the agency’s website. The NBS sits within the NIH’s Office of Management, under the Office of the Director, and administers the core running of the NIH, including procurement, property management, data consolidation, and financial reporting. One NIH employee, who was granted anonymity as they are not authorized to speak on behalf of the agency, referred to NBS as “NIH’s wallet.”\\n\\nGot a Tip?\\n\\nAre you a current NIH employee, or otherwise have insight into how DOGE is operating within the government? We’d like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter on Signal: mattreynolds.45\\n\\nNone of the DOGE-linked NIH employees responded to WIRED’s requests to comment. The NIH did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment.\\n\\nThe NIH is the largest federal funder of biomedical research and a key sub-agency within HHS—the government agency now headed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Earlier in February the NIH dramatically slashed the funding it gives to universities, leaning heavily on a report by the Heritage Foundation that railed against the “massive growth in DEI staff at US universities.” The NIH, which has a budget of $48 billion, has also frozen funding for applications for $1.5 billion in medical research, according to NPR.\\n\\nDOGE workers, according to WIRED reporting, have effectively taken over key government agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management and the GSA. On Saturday, employees throughout the federal government were left in confusion after receiving an email from the OPM demanding that they reply with “approx 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week.”\\n\\nThe Trump administration’s executive orders and policies have also wreaked havoc on domestic and international research. Cuts to USAID are helping to fuel human trafficking at scammer compounds and have made it harder for food aid to be delivered. Meanwhile, cuts at the US Department of Agriculture have derailed vital climate and crop projects intended to benefit farmers.'},\n",

Jonathan Reynolds, the UK\\'s business and trade secretary, met his Indian counterpart Piyush Goyal in Delhi on Monday and kicked off the two-day discussions. The talks focused on \"advancing\" the negotiations and ensuring that the deal was \"balanced, ambitious and mutually beneficial\", Goyal wrote on X. The countries have held more than a dozen rounds of negotiations since 2022, but an agreement has remained out of reach.\\n\\nSticking points include high tariffs in India on Scotch whisky and relaxing fees and visa rules for Indian students and professionals going to the UK. Talks are being held for the first time after the Labour Party came to power in the UK and Reynolds says securing a deal is a \"top priority\" for his government. \"Growth will be the guiding principle in our trade negotiations with India and I\\'m excited about the opportunities on offer in this vibrant market,\" he said in a statement ahead of the meeting. India is forecast to become the world\\'s third-largest economy in a few years. The ministers held a joint press conference after the meeting, but neither side offered a deadline for talks to conclude. Deadlines set by former ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss had passed without an agreement being finalised. For Delhi, the trade talks have assumed renewed significance on the back of US President Donald Trump\\'s decision to impose reciprocal or tit-for-tat tariffs on imported goods from countries, including India. The UK is also a high-priority trading partner for Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\'s government, which has an ambitious target to grow exports by $1 trillion by FY30.\\n\\nX/Piyush Goyal Jonathan Reynolds (left) met his Indian counterpart Piyush Goyal in Delhi'},\n",

       "   'time': 'unknown',\n",
       "   'content': 'Elon Musk has long been Tesla\\'s public face, convincing consumers to pay premium prices for electric vehicles that promised to help combat climate change. But as Musk has navigated toward conservative politics and emerged as a close adviser to President Trump, some Tesla owners say they are reconsidering their loyalty to the brand.\\n\\nWall Street analysts worry the Tesla brand is showing some cracks, with sales falling 1% in 2024 from the prior year — the automaker\\'s first annual sales decline in 12 years, even as global EV sales rose 7.3%. They also say Musk\\'s political activities risk alienating consumers, while protests have erupted at a number of Tesla dealerships across the U.S. over his proximity to the Trump administration.\\n\\n\"It would seem that potential consumers for Tesla EVs might be turning away from the company because they don\\'t appreciate Elon Musk\\'s close relationship to President Trump and the administration\\'s tariff policies,\" Mike O\\'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, told CBS MoneyWatch.\\n\\nSince Mr. Trump\\'s Jan. 20 inauguration, the carmaker\\'s stock has dropped 17% due to the \"visible perceived downside impact\" of Musk\\'s involvement with the White House, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a Feb. 19 research note.\\n\\nThe inextricable link between Musk, the world\\'s richest person, and Tesla\\'s brand illustrates both the opportunities and risks of tying a company\\'s fortunes to the personality of a single executive. Musk has led Tesla from its days as a scrappy startup to the world\\'s biggest producer of EVs, growing its valuation to more than $1.2 trillion, making it one of the world\\'s most valuable businesses.\\n\\nBut Musk\\'s recent inflammatory public statements and his role leading Mr. Trump\\'s cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, appear to be turning off some Americans. Consumers\\' political leanings can play into their decision to buy an electric vehicle, with Democrats three times more likely to buy an EV than Republicans, according to a 2024 Pew Research Center poll.\\n\\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment about the impact of Musk\\'s political activities on the automaker.\\n\\nCustomer dissatisfaction\\n\\nAmong the one-time Tesla fans who have had second thoughts is Minah Oh, 40, of Massachusetts, who told CBS MoneyWatch that Musk\\'s political activities led her to sell her Tesla Model X, which she had owned since 2015, in October.\\n\\n\"I got it because it was great for the environment, and at the time he was more on the liberal side of politics,\" Oh told CBS MoneyWatch about Musk. But, she added, she felt that Musk by last fall had become \"volatile and turned radically right.\"\\n\\nOh also said she was concerned that driving a Tesla could signal to others that she\\'s aligned with Musk\\'s political opinions.\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t want people to think I was a Trumper or that I am associated with Elon, because he is so tied to the brand,\" Oh said. \"I am so happy I sold it, because if I was driving it today, in the current climate I would be so embarrassed.\"\\n\\nJake Nickell is another former Tesla owner who has distanced himself from the car company because of Musk\\'s evolving reputation. An early EV fan, the Chicago-based entrepreneur bought the first of three Tesla vehicles he eventually purchased, a Roadster sportscar, in 2006.\\n\\n\"It was super fun to see an electric car company come up and be viable,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. He sold the car for a profit when it was no longer practical for his growing family, replacing it with a Tesla Model S and later a Model X.\\n\\nBut Nickell said he sold the Model X in 2021 because he was unhappy with the vehicle and because of Musk\\'s changing public persona. He replaced it with a car from rival EV maker Rivian.\\n\\n\"We were not happy with how [Musk] was acting on many levels. It was a slow slide. He started getting into the \\'bro\\' startup culture of cryptocurrency at time, and there were signs that he was sliding into right-wing politics. We didn\\'t want anything to do with that anymore,\" Nickell said of why he sold his family\\'s Model X.\\n\\nAsked if he\\'d ever buy a Tesla again, Nickell responded, \"Absolutely not.\" He\\'s now helping his son buy a car and is considering a Toyota Prius or an EV from Volkswagen.\\n\\nMusician Sheryl Crow is another former Tesla owner who recently distanced herself from the brand, writing in an Instagram post that she sold her vehicle because of Musk\\'s recent political activities.\\n\\n\"There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with. So long Tesla,\" she wrote, adding that she was donating the proceeds of the sale to NPR because the Trump administration wants to cut its federal funding.\\n\\nWall Street analysts have voiced concern about the impact of Musk\\'s reputation on the company\\'s sales. That includes in Europe, where Tesla sales in Germany, a key market, fell roughly 60% last month, according to Reuters.\\n\\n\"Musk\\'s DOGE related actions and more powerful alliance with Trump clearly could alienate some consumers to move away from the Tesla brand,\" Ives, who remains bullish on the company\\'s prospects, said in his Feb. 19 report. \"There is some momentum around this effort in Europe and pockets of the U.S. as well since November.\"\\n\\nTesla\\'s \"net favorability rating,\" which measures consumers\\' perception of the brand based on survey responses, is at all-time lows, according to Stephen Gengaro, an analyst for investment advisory firm Stifel, who believes that Musk could be hurting the brand\\'s score. Researchers asked consumers if they had a \"favorable\" or \"unfavorable\" impression of Tesla, ranging from \"very favorable\" to \"very unfavorable,\" to determine the rating. Respondents could also reply that they\\'d never heard of the brand, or that they had no opinion.\\n\\nTesla\\'s favorability rating sank to 3%, a six percentage point decline, for the week ended Jan. 28, compared with 9% in January 2024, according to data from Stifel Think Tank Group, the firm\\'s research and analysis arm. In January 2018, the company\\'s favorability rating stood at 33%.\\n\\n\"[M]any on the Street view Musk spending \\'100% of his time\\' with DOGE as creating a negative perception around his Tesla focus,\" Gengaro wrote in a research note.\\n\\nPartisan divide\\n\\nMore than half of Americans held a negative view of Musk, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted between Jan. 27 and Feb. 2. Views were starkly divided based on political party, with about 7 in 10 Republicans saying they had a favorable view of him, while more than 8 in 10 Democrats said they viewed him unfavorably.\\n\\nThose changing perceptions may be rubbing off on car buyers, with a February Morning Consult poll finding that about 32% of U.S. buyers \"would not consider\" buying a Tesla, a five percentage point increase compared with a year earlier, according to a recent CNN report.\\n\\nIn states that voted Democratic in the last four presidential elections, the share of repeat Tesla buyers dropped seven percentage points over the past year, falling from 72% at the end of 2023 to 65% by the fourth quarter of 2024, according to additional data provided to CNN by S&P Global Mobility. Repeat buyers in states that voted Republican barely inched higher, rising from 47.6% to 48.2% over the same period.\\n\\nIn California, the country\\'s largest market for electric vehicles, total driver registrations for Tesla\\'s cars fell 11.6% percent in 2024, according to data from Experian automotive. Registrations for all other brands increased 1.4%, California New Car Dealers Association NCDA wrote in a January report.\\n\\nCould Musk\\'s ties to Trump actually help Tesla?\\n\\nAt the same time, some on Wall Street say there are potential upsides to Musk\\'s alliance with Mr. Trump. Perhaps most important, the Trump administration may seek to weaken or eliminate federal rules governing Tesla\\'s self-driving vehicle technology, a major initiative for Tesla.\\n\\nMusk has long had ambitions to launch full self-driving vehicles powered by AI. The company plans to launch autonomous ride hailing in Austin in June, Musk confirmed. Yet such efforts have been slowed by federal investigations into vehicle crashes involving Tesla\\'s \"Full Self-Driving\" system and by existing safety regulations.\\n\\n\"Trump\\'s election, and the bromance between Trump and Musk, will essentially lead to the defanging of a regulatory environment that\\'s been stifling Tesla,\" Ives told the Associated Press.\\n\\nIf the Trump administration eases regulations for self-driving cars, it would be \"a significant tailwind for Tesla\\'s autonomous and AI vision heading into 2025,\" he added.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the dip in consumer perceptions of Tesla\\'s brand could simply be a short-term headwind, Gengaro said. And long-term, the company\\'s development of robotaxis and self-driving vehicles could provide much more of Tesla\\'s growth than vehicle sales to consumers, he added.\\n\\nTesla\\'s sales struggles also could be based on other issues besides Musk, including mounting competition for EVs from other automakers. And Tesla\\'s sales decline in Germany could be due to a preference among consumers there for electric cars made by homegrown automakers such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen.'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-21T11:30:00',\n",
       "   'content': \"This month, Andrew Bernier, a US Army Corps of Engineers researcher and a union leader, says that he has received a barrage of menacing messages from the same anonymous email account. Unfolding like short chapters in a dystopian novel, they have spoken of the genius of Elon Musk, referenced the power of the billionaire’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), and foretold the downfall of “corrupt” union bosses.\\n\\nBut the most eerie thing about the emails, which Bernier says began arriving after he filed an official charge accusing the Trump administration of violating his union’s collective bargaining agreement, is that they included personal details about his life—some of which he believes might have come from surveillance of his work laptop. The author referenced Bernier’s union activities, nickname, job, travel details, and even the green notebook he regularly uses. The most recent email implied that his computer was loaded with spyware. “Andy's crusade, like so many before it, had been doomed from the start,” one email stated. “The real tragedy wasn't his failure—it was his belief that the fight had ever been real.”\\n\\nThe unsettling messages, which were reviewed by WIRED, are an extreme example of the kinds of encounters that workers across the US government say they have had with technology since President Donald Trump took office. WIRED spoke to current employees at 13 federal agencies for this story who expressed fears about potentially being monitored by software programs, some of which they described as unfamiliar. Others said that routine software updates and notifications, perhaps once readily glossed over, have taken on ominous new meanings. Several reported feeling anxious and hyperaware of the devices and technology around them.\\n\\nAt the General Services Administration (GSA), one worker cited a Chrome browser extension called Dynatrace, an existing program for monitoring app performance. Inside the Social Security Administration, another employee pointed to Splunk, a long-standing tool that’s used to alert IT staff to security anomalies like when an unauthorized USB drive is plugged into a laptop. At the US Agency for International Development, one worker was caught off guard by Google’s Gemini AI chatbot, installations of which kicked off days before Trump took office.\\n\\n“Everyone has been talking about whether our laptops are now able to listen to our conversations and track what we do,” says a current GSA employee, who like other workers in this story was granted anonymity because they didn’t have authorization to speak and feared retaliation.\\n\\nDynatrace and Splunk did not respond to requests for comment from WIRED.\\n\\nThe workers’ accounts come as Musk’s DOGE organization is rapidly burrowing into various government agencies and departments, often gaining access to personnel records, logs of financial transactions, and other sensitive information in the process. The efforts are part of the Trump administration’s broader plan to terminate thousands of government employees and remake the face of federal agencies.\\n\\nLike many private companies, US federal agencies disclose to staff that they have tools to monitor what workers do on their computers and networks. The US government’s capabilities in this area have also expanded over the past decade.\"},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-21T22:01:19',\n",
       "   'content': 'Over the past couple of decades, a number of US government officials have left their roles for lucrative jobs at tech companies. Plenty of tech executives have also departed to take leadership positions inside federal agencies. But four experts who track the federal workforce tell WIRED they were stunned last week by a development unlike any other they could recall: The Department of Treasury internally announced that Tom Krause had been appointed its fiscal assistant secretary, but that he would simultaneously continue his job as CEO of the company Cloud Software Group.\\n\\nKrause is now in charge of both a sensitive government payment system and a company that has millions of dollars’ worth of active contracts with various federal agencies through distribution partners, according to a WIRED review of searchable spending records. The Department of Treasury alone accounts for a dozen ongoing contracts tied to Krause’s company that are together valued between $7.3 million to $11.8 million. These include licenses for the data visualization tool ibi WebFocus and purchases of systems called Citrix NetScaler that help manage traffic to apps. (Some publicly posted procurement records do not break out contract details, so actual figures may be even higher.)\\n\\nCritics have expressed concern about the alleged conflicts of interest posed by Krause’s decision to keep his role in the private sector. Cloud Software could benefit from extending its federal contracts or securing additional ones, though there is no public evidence that Krause has done anything improper with his dual roles. Existing federal regulations also bar actual and apparent unjust favoritism in contracting. “Public trust in those safeguards is nonnegotiable,” says Scott Amey, general counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan watchdog group.\\n\\nAs Krause moves forward with two jobs, he could have to potentially navigate not only contracting conflicts, but also dueling crises. “What would happen if a Citrix emergency emerges at the same time as Treasury obligations?” says Jeff Hauser, founder and executive director of the Revolving Door Project, which researches federal appointees. “Generally, the thicket of restrictions on full-time employees would make a CEO role impossible in an administration which took adherence to ethics laws seriously.”\\n\\nKrause, the Treasury Department, and Cloud Software didn’t respond to requests for comment. Cloud Software investors also didn’t respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nThe Treasury Department has told Congress that Krause is a “special government employee”—a type of temporary role—that is supposed to be held to “the same ethical standards of privacy, confidentiality, conflicts of interest assessment, and professionalism of other government employees.” In a foreword to a code of conduct policy posted on Cloud Software’s website, Krause states, “Cloud Software Group is committed to ensuring that its business is conducted ethically, in compliance with the law, and according to its values of integrity, honesty and respect.”\\n\\nKrause is among a group of several dozen veteran tech executives, mid-level tech operations managers, and fresh-out-of-school software coders who have been recently installed across a series of federal agencies under the auspices of the self-styled Department of Government Efficiency. DOGE’s authority is being challenged by some Democratic state attorneys general. In the meantime, its representatives have been carrying out an order from President Donald Trump to cut costs and modernize technology across the government.'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-21T19:58:10',\n",
       "   'content': 'When the so-called Department of Government Efficiency recently fired dozens of people from the US Digital Service—the agency DOGE subsumed last month—it may not have realized the extent of the collateral damage.\\n\\nThe USDS doesn\\'t operate in a vacuum; part of its longtime mandate is to consult with federal agencies to help improve their digital platforms and websites. So when DOGE terminated Jonathan Kamens in its agency purge, it may not have fully grasped that it was firing the security lead for the Department of Veterans Affairs website—the digital hub that connects veterans with their benefits and hosts sensitive personal data, including medical records.\\n\\nInterviews with multiple current and former VA sources, along with veterans who now work in private-sector cybersecurity, indicate that Kamens’ firing could have disastrous privacy consequences for millions of US veterans.\\n\\n“I believe that his abrupt firing puts the security of veterans services at risk,” one source with knowledge of VA systems, who was granted anonymity because they fear retaliation, told WIRED about Kamens. “Eliminating the person responsible for the security of veteran information on VA.gov erodes the quality of the service for the veteran. It’s reckless.”\\n\\nVA.gov is what Kamens calls “the front door” for all VA benefits. The site served more than 20 million registered users in the past 12 months, resulting in more than 53 million transactions. Veterans go there to access, among other things, financial, educational, health care, and death benefits. In other words, VA digital services are not only central to the lives of many veterans and their families but also a repository of deeply private information about their lives.\\n\\n“It’s inevitable that the cybersecurity practice within VA.gov is going to suffer and that they are going to fall behind on what they are required to do in order to keep cybersecurity on VA.gov where it needs to be,” Kamens says. “And the result of that is it’s going to get worse, and eventually it will get bad enough that there will be an incident.”\\n\\nKamens was not the only person working on VA digital security and was far from the only person there who cares about safeguarding veterans\\' personal data. But he served a vital role in a large and important government apparatus that is notoriously strapped for resources. In particular, Kamens says, he was the only staffer working full-time on VA.gov cybersecurity and, therefore, the point person for overseeing protective upgrades and services from third-party security vendors.\\n\\n“This is sensitive data that in the wrong hands can do harm to people,” Kamens says. “There was always too much work to do and not enough people to do it, and now all of a sudden I’m gone. DOGE is all about efficiency, and that is not going to make VA more efficient.”\\n\\nThe VA did not comment in response to WIRED\\'s questions about changes in the cybersecurity staffing for VA.gov. In addition to cuts at USDS, more than 1,000 workers were fired from the VA itself last week. “President Trump\\'s looking for efficiencies so that we can do our job better,\" said secretary of veterans affairs Doug Collins in a video statement on Thursday. “When you\\'re doing things, you\\'re making moves, you\\'re making good moves, motion causes friction.”'},\n",

Among them is the Integrated Data Retrieval System, or IDRS, which enables tax agency employees to access IRS accounts—including personal identification numbers—and bank information. It also lets them enter and adjust transaction data and automatically generate notices, collection documents and other records. According to a draft of the memorandum obtained by The Washington Post, DOGE software engineer Gavin Kliger is set to work at the IRS for 120 days, though the tax agency and the White House can renew his deployment for the same duration.\\n\\n(As is the case with many of the attractions in the DOGE and pony show, Kliger has some interesting hobbies in his off-hours, according to USA Today:\\n\\nIn social media posts between October 2024 and January, Kliger has voiced controversial views and reposted content from white supremacist Nick Fuentes and self-described misogynist Andrew Tate. An OPM spokeswoman declined to comment on Kliger’s posts. Kliger did not respond to multiple requests for comment via email and text. Following Reuters’ request for comment on Thursday evening, public access to Kliger’s X account was blocked.\\n\\nThis is appalling on its face. It’s time for individual bureaucrats to start refusing admission to their offices. Lay in provisions. Lock the doors and barricade them. Alert the media so you’ll get coverage when they break down the doors and haul you out. Throw your bodies onto the machine, people. Allons, enfants!\\n\\nAt the same time it’s sending its invasive species into the IRS, the administration is feeding the agency’s actual employees into its wood chipper. This is, of course, insane.'}],\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-15T14:20:00',\n",
       "   'content': '(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to the Last Post of the Week from the Blog’s Favourite Living Canadian)\\n\\nOut in Scottsdale in Arizona, it appears that the book banners have notched another victory over the forces of intellectual diversity and good reading. From the Arizona Republic:\\n\\n“We invite parents to review our school libraries’ inventory and, should they have concerns, to use the process SUSD has established to either restrict their own student’s access to a particular title or to challenge the book’s value in our public-school libraries,” the school district’s statement said. The processes for a parent to restrict a book from being checked out by their child and to challenge a library book can both be initiated on the Scottsdale Unified website. The books were removed from libraries in August, according to the district, while they were reviewed. Most of the challenged books had not been checked out by students in the past four school years, according to district records.\\n\\nMore important, note how many “parents groups” lined up behind the book banners.\\n\\nThe letter was sent on behalf of several organizations, including Scottsdale Unites for Educational Integrity, Arizona Women of Action and Restore Parental Rights in Education. It said the books cited “fail to possess any serious educational value for minors, or serious artistic, literary, political or scientific value,” mirroring language in a state law passed in 2022 that prohibits public schools from referring students to or using any “sexually explicit material.”\\n\\nI would draw your attention to that bit about “several organizations.” Somebody had the time and the money to organize a “movement” that already has achieved one of its prime purposes. I am willing to bet a shiny nickel that, if you had lists of membership for all these groups, the same names would pop up on all the rosters. That is how you create a Potemkin movement. If everything ever gets back to normal, it will be incumbent that a) we deal somehow with the torrent of money in our politics and b) we examine closely the role of 501(c)3 groups in our politics. If we can’t keep the money out, we can control where it goes.\\n\\nVice President J. Divan Vance brought some sunshine to a security conference with European leaders. The meeting was held in Munich, which seems appropriate, Nuremberg apparently being booked. Basically, Vance told the Europeans that the EU now looks like the Soviet bloc and that countries devastated by Nazi Germany and the war to destroy it are being impolite to the heirs of the Reich in their midst. Between this and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s bizarre “You can’t shoot values” speech, it is dawning on the Europeans that the United States is now one big Fox News green room. From Politico:\\n\\n“The threat that I worry the most about vis-à-vis Europe is not Russia. It’s not China, it’s not any other external actor. And what I worry about is the threat from within,” the vice president said. “The retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.\\n\\n“In Washington there is a new sheriff in town, and under Donald Trump’s leadership, we may disagree with your views, but we will fight to defend your right to offer it in the public square agree or disagree,” Vance said, adding: “Dismissing people, dismissing their concerns … shutting down media, shutting down elections … protects nothing. It is the most surefire way to destroy democracy.… If you’re running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you.”\\n\\nHe attacked high levels of migration, touching on the same themes that animated Trump’s return to power in the United States. He said he was praying for the victims of Thursday’s attack in Munich, when a migrant drove a car into a crowd, injuring 28. “How many times must we suffer these appalling setbacks before we change course and take our civilization in a different direction?” Vance said, adding that the number of immigrants from non-EU countries who entered the bloc doubled from 2021 to 2022. This was “the result of a series of conscious decisions made by politicians all over the continent,” Vance said. Taking an absolutist view of free speech, Vance said: “I believe deeply that there is no security if you are afraid of the voices, the opinions and the conscience that guide your very own people.”\\n\\nThis is coming from the representative of an administration that is presently firing anyone who might tell the truth about its corruption and that has locked the AP—the freaking AP!—out of White House events because the wire service won’t say that the Caribbean touches the “Gulf of America.” Moreover, Vance went out of his way to meet with the same neo-Nazi political party that so entrances President Musk.\\n\\n“If American democracy can survive 10 years of Greta Thunberg’s scolding, you guys can survive a few months of Elon Musk,” Vance said, comparing a 22-year-old Swedish climate activist with the owner of X and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX.\\n\\nWow. I’ll bet he had to scour the Joe Rogan archives to come up with that one. Vance already is leading the straw polls for the 2028 German Republican primary.\\n\\nWeekly WWOZ Pick to Click: “St. Philip Street Breakdown” (Dr. Michael White)—Yeah, I still pretty much love New Orleans.\\n\\nWeekly Visit to the Pathé Archives: I have to give the folks at Pathé credit for some very deep shade. In reaction to the president’s intensified dialogue with Vladimir Putin, and their prelude to the selling out of Ukraine, they give us Neville Chamberlain’s arrival from Europe, pledging peace in his time. History is so cool.\\n\\nHere is my leftover scorecard from the Super Bowl.\\n\\nCommercial MVP: Eugene Levy’s eyebrows.\\n\\nMusical MVP: Trombone Shorty’s lively, Second Line arrangement of “America the Beautiful.”\\n\\nOn-Field MVP: I would have to vote for Philadelphia’s Josh Sweat. The Eagle defense was the story of the entire game, and he was their best player on that side of the ball. I am a great admirer of the way Jalen Hurts has worked to build his career as a quarterback, but that Philadelphia defense was the best I’ve seen in a Super Bowl since the 1985 Chicago Bears ate the New England Patriots for lunch. And yes, I remember the Baltimore Ravens in 2001. They weren’t playing Patrick Mahomes and the brain of Andy Reid.\\n\\nDiscovery Corner: Hey, look what we found. From the AP (because fck you, White House).\\n\\nArchaeologists exploring the site of a planned 32-story office tower announced Thursday that they have unearthed the remains of a Roman basilica that once stood at the heart of the city known as Londinium. Excavations in the basement of a building slated to be demolished for the tower at 85 Gracechurch Street uncovered flint, brick and ragstone walls and foundations, up to 1 meter (over 3 feet) wide, 4 meters (13 feet) deep and two millennia old.\\n\\nSophie Jackson of Museum of London Archaeology called it “one of the most significant discoveries” in years in London’s oldest quarter, the City—the square-mile financial district where modern glass high-rises stand atop the remnants of Victorian, medieval and even earlier structures. What’s been uncovered are the foundations of a two-story building, almost as big as an Olympic swimming pool. It was constructed between 78 and 84 A.D., about three decades after Roman troops invaded Britain and some 20 years after forces of the Celtic warrior queen Boudicca sacked the fledgling settlement.\\n\\nFor me, most “financial districts” could use a good sacking or two, but that would be dreadfully uncivil.\\n\\nHey, New Scientist. Is it a good day for dinosaur news? It’s always a good day for dinosaur news!\\n\\n\\n\\nBirds evolved from theropods, a group of dinosaurs that included tyrannosaurs and velociraptors, during the Jurassic period. Archaeopteryx, discovered in 1861, has long been considered one of the earliest birds in the fossil record. But its position on the evolutionary tree is debated because, despite having feathered wings, Archaeopteryx is more similar to non-avian theropods in having a long, reptilian tail.\\n\\nThe new fossil was found in Zhenghe County in Fujian province in November 2023 and has been given the species name Baminornis zhenghensis. Only the trunk, forelimb, pelvis and part of the hindlimb are preserved. Baminornis lived at the same time as Archaeopteryx but it has a short tail like those of modern birds, pushing back the date of this evolutionary innovation by 20 million years. “A short tail is widely regarded as aerodynamically beneficial, and the reduction of the tail constitutes the most dramatic change during the dinosaurs-bird transition,” says Min Wang at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, a member of the team that analysed the fossil.\\n\\nAgain, I leave it to you filthy-minded bastids to fill in the jokes about “short-tail.” But it is plain that dinosaurs lived then to make us happy now, and one way they did that was by evolving into birds. Those bluebirds visiting your backyard feeder, their ancestor was a T. rex, so treat them with respect.\\n\\nI’ll be back on Monday for whatever fresh hell awaits. Be well and play nice, ya bastids. Stay above the snake-line and wear the damn masks, and take the damn shots, especially the boosters and the New One. In your spare time, spare a thought for everyone touched by the crash in Washington, and in the fire zones in Los Angeles, and for all the folks in Ukraine, who stubbornly fight on, and all the folks in Gaza, with winter coming on, and all the people in New Orleans, Las Vegas, Nashville, and Queens, who were visited by the Crazy before the year had hardly begun. And the folks in LA, now fighting floods and mudslides exacerbated by the recent wildfires. And the folks in Lahaina, who are still rebuilding. And all the folks we regularly cited here in the year gone by, and especially for our fellow citizens in the LGBTQ+ community, who deserve so much better from their country than they’ve been getting. And for all of us, who will be getting exactly what we deserve.'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-24T00:00:00',\n",
       "   'content': 'Milliken, Colorado CNN —\\n\\nTake a ride with David Hayes around his Colorado ranch and you learn right away he is a feisty, funny guy.\\n\\n“I tried farming for a while,” he told a visitor. “I would rather get run over by a bison.”\\n\\nThere is just one bison remaining on the Spomer Ranch, down from 60 or 70 a few years ago. “I’m retiring,” Hayes said. “Just about 70 and my body isn’t working too good anymore.”\\n\\nTrouble is the last bison’s name. And Hayes was quick to add that trouble is what he sees in Washington one month into President Donald Trump’s second act.\\n\\n“I really don’t like him as a person,” Hayes said. “I think he is arrogant. Kind of a jerk.”\\n\\nYes, Hayes believes the federal workforce can be trimmed considerably. But to him, the current approach seems more impulsive than coherent. “I’m not sure (Trump) thought through the process,” Hayes said. “It’s kind of like, ‘Let’s just get it over with and dump everybody.’”\\n\\nPlus, he doesn’t trust or believe Elon Musk and bristles when he hears the billionaire and his team are trying to gain access to sensitive tax and Social Security records.\\n\\n“I don’t like it,” Hayes said. “I don’t think they should be in our business.”\\n\\nHayes rolled his eyes as he recounted Trump and Musk alleging there are numerous people allegedly between the ages of 100 and 150 claiming Social Security.\\n\\n“Can you believe any of that crap?” he said as we drove across the 100-acre ranch. “You can’t substantiate it. You can’t believe it. So that is a trust issue. … (Trump) is doing all this stuff and I don’t think he understands the ramifications of what he is doing.”\\n\\nIt is a damning take from a blue-collar three-time Trump voter who lives in a rural area where Democrats have struggled in recent years. But Democrats should hold the celebration. We ask Hayes what he would choose if he could redo his 2024 vote now that he has watched Trump’s tumultuous first month. “I would still do Trump,” he said.\\n\\nThat was a recurring theme as we visited Colorado’s 8th Congressional District as part of our “All Over the Map” project. The district stretches from the northern Denver suburbs to just south of the Wyoming border. It is 40% Hispanic, evenly divided politically and will be critical as House Republicans defend their tiny majority in the 2026 midterms. The president’s political standing is almost always the best midterm barometer, and on this first visit we focused on Trump voters.\\n\\n“I love it,” Esmeralda Ramirez-Ray said of Trump’s frenetic first month. “That is what I voted for.”\\n\\nShe wholeheartedly backed Musk’s march through federal agencies.\\n\\n“I don’t know why it surprises anybody,” she said, noting Musk’s big role in the final weeks of the campaign. “You haven’t been paying attention if that is a surprise.”\\n\\nEsmeralda Ramirez-Ray talks with John King in Greeley, Colorado. CNN\\n\\nAsked where she gets her news, Ramirez-Ray listed Musk’s X social media platform and the Epoch Times, a far-right publication known for its support of Trump and its history of criticizing vaccines and advancing conspiracy theories. “I don’t watch Fox,” she said. “I don’t watch CNN. I don’t watch ABC, NBC, any of that. … It’s really hard for me to get news I can trust or that I can believe in.”\\n\\nRamirez-Ray was raised as a Democrat and said she and her parents faced backlash from other Latinos when they warmed to Trump back in 2016. “They couldn’t believe someone of Hispanic origin would support somebody that was being labeled a racist. We didn’t believe that he was, and we campaigned, and we voted for him.”\\n\\nNow, she sees a first month of keeping promises. She does air one disagreement with Trump — wishing he would change his tone when it comes to immigration.\\n\\n“I was raised as a migrant worker working in the fields,” Ramirez-Ray said in an interview at her office in Greeley, 65 miles north of Denver. “Those are the people out there picking their crops. So even though I support Trump, I don’t believe he is the end-all, be-all savior of humanity. Nobody is.”\\n\\nRamirez-Ray works as an interpreter for court defendants who don’t understand English, and many of her clients are undocumented immigrants who work in meatpacking plants, construction, farming or other jobs. She agrees that some undocumented immigrants are violent, but said she wishes Trump would understand “the majority of my clients who are here are good, honest people trying to make a living, and there should be a legal pathway for them to remain here.”\\n\\nTodd Waufle founded Satire Brewing in 2018. It is in Thornton, a community 12 miles north of Denver, that Waufle describes as “50-50” politically and where one bipartisan complaint is the fast-moving suburban sprawl.\\n\\n“The day after the election, yeah, it was 50-50,” Waufle said. “Half the people were crying in their beers, really upset. I mean really emotional. … Then the other half are, like, high-fiving and cheering and jovial.”\\n\\nCount Waufle among the jovial, then and now.\\n\\n“I like him going full-speed,” Waufle said of Trump. “Let’s get things done. Let’s find out if the policies work, if they don’t work. … I’m all for him getting in action.”\\n\\nSatire Brewing owner Todd Waufle talks with John King in Thornton, Colorado. CNN\\n\\nLike Ramirez-Ray, Waufle has no issues with Musk and his work, at least not yet.\\n\\n“He can make things happen, too,” Waufle said. “You got two guys in there playing, working.”\\n\\nNot that Waufle loves everything in the Trump agenda.\\n\\nBusiness at the brewery is solid, and he constantly debates expanding. During a tour, Waufle shows us new fermentation tanks not yet in use and an open space where he wants to install canning machines so he can increase production and sales. But that is on hold for now because of Trump’s tariffs on aluminum.\\n\\n“If you fly enough, you understand,” he said of navigating the early days of the new Trump term. “Buckle your seat belt. Turbulence ahead.”\\n\\nBut he voiced confidence that things will ultimately settle to a point that he feels comfortable with his expansion plan. Waufle’s approach is a trademark of many Trump voters: accept the things that make them cringe to get the things they believe Trump is best equipped to deliver, beginning with a better economy and a stronger border.\\n\\n“He’s a little pompous, arrogant,” Waufle said. “It’s not necessarily my style. But it works for him. … Trump is going to say what he is going to say and, yes, some of it is going to be exaggerated, some is not going to be true. But at the end of the day, I think you got to sift through all that. Is he going to get things done? Is he going to get the country moving the right way? Is the border going to get taken care of? Are we going to cut costs?”\\n\\nAustin Jenkins cast his November ballot hoping lower taxes and less regulation would help his family and small businesses, which include a cocktail bar and the Greeley Hatchet House — an axe-throwing venue.\\n\\n“I think he is a little outrageous and wild at times,” Jenkins, 28, said of Trump. “I’m not necessarily a Trump guy. I’m just much more conservative in my opinions.’\\n\\nHis wife’s family are Democrats, and the conversation with Jenkins is rich with evidence that his politics are shifting as he starts a family and his businesses take root in Greeley’s diverse community.\\n\\n“They have taught me a lot and it has softened my heart a lot, too,” Jenkins said.\\n\\nHe worries that Trump’s tariffs will add costs and stress to small businesses already dealing with high costs and high interest rates.\\n\\nHatchet House owner Austin Jenkins shows John King how to throw an axe in Greeley, Colorado. CNN\\n\\nAnd Jenkins sees fear in a Latino community he describes as vital to his businesses and the area.\\n\\n“We’ve got friends and family that we care about a lot and, like, they’re nervous they are going to drop their kids off at school and somebody’s going to grab them.”\\n\\nJenkins is all for a stronger border and a more organized immigration process. But he wishes Trump would accept the reality of communities such as Greeley that have significant numbers of undocumented workers.\\n\\n“The hardest-working people I’ve ever met,” Jenkins said. “It’s unfortunate what’s happening. I think there is a better way to go about it. I don’t know if it is necessarily just force them out.”\\n\\nThe blizzard of executive actions also is unsettling.\\n\\n“I thought there’s supposed to be checks and balances,” Jenkins said.\\n\\nTrump won’t be on the 2026 ballot, of course, and we are just a month into his new term. But if concerns like those Jenkins has about immigration, Musk and presidential power continue to grow, battleground Republicans such as freshman GOP Rep. Gabe Evans here could find a more difficult midterm climate. Evans won by a little more than 2,000 votes, and the district is already a top Democratic target.\\n\\nFor now, though, what comes up most among voters here is the same issue that dominated the 2024 race.\\n\\n“The big thing here is the cost of living is getting crazy here in Colorado,” Jenkins said. “It seems like everybody is kind of drowning a little bit.”\\n\\nHayes, the soon-to-retire bison rancher, jokes that “eggs are worth more than diamonds” now. He also is trying to solve another cost-of-living issue that makes him cranky — not a good thing for any incumbent politician.\\n\\n“I have one drug that went from $4.60 in December to $45 in January,” Hayes said. “Nobody knew why. It’s those kinds of things that kind of tick a guy off a little bit.”'},\n",

       "   'content': 'is a senior correspondent at Vox, where he focuses on the Supreme Court, the Constitution, and the decline of liberal democracy in the United States. He received a JD from Duke University and is the author of two books on the Supreme Court.\\n\\nAt the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Justice William Rehnquist’s nomination for chief justice, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-DE, is seen holding a copy of the Constitution and rubbing his forehead. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\\n\\nWe’re less than two months into the second Trump administration, but one thing is clear: President Donald Trump would very much like to be unbound by the Constitution.\\n\\nThus far, the courts have not been particularly tolerant of Trump’s unconstitutional actions.\\n\\nRelated How to make sense of all the court orders against Donald Trump\\n\\nIndeed, Trump’s attempts to subvert the Constitution have been so frequent and so unapologetic, that many scholars are already labeling the situation a constitutional crisis — a situation in which the Constitution either fails to work as designed or is simply ignored by those in power.\\n\\nIf the United States is actually in a crisis it so far has been a managed one. Thus far, the Trump administration has complied with court orders blocking many of its unconstitutional actions. Some members of the administration, most notably Vice President JD Vance, have suggested that Trump should simply ignore these orders and behave as if he is unbound by law. But, for the moment, the Trump administration is not openly defying any of the orders against it.\\n\\nThis tenuous moment could escalate into a full-blown constitutional crisis at any moment, however. And it could get there in one of two ways.\\n\\nThe first is if Trump actually did openly defy a court order insisting that he must comply with the Constitution. If that were to occur, the only lawful mechanism remaining to control his behavior would be impeachment. And, when you consider the fact that the Senate couldn’t find the required 67 votes to disqualify him from office in 2021 after he incited a mob to attack the US Capitol, a successful impeachment seems highly unlikely.\\n\\nThe second possibility is even worse: if the courts, and, especially, the Supreme Court, choose to be complicit in Trump’s attacks on the Constitution.\\n\\nIt’s not hard to imagine the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 Republican supermajority, deciding to cast its lot with the leader of the Republican Party. Just last July, the Republican justices ruled that Trump is immune from prosecution for nearly all crimes he commits using his official powers as president.\\n\\nWorse, much of that opinion argued that Trump cannot face consequences even if he orders the Justice Department to target his political rivals. So the Republican justices have already preemptively given Trump permission to use state power in a manner that’s inconsistent with the rule of law.\\n\\nIf the justices were to uphold some of Trump’s unconstitutional actions, such as his attack on birthright citizenship or his attempt to “impound” federal funds he does not want to spend, that would grant a patina of legitimacy to those actions. And it would likely give Trump’s allies in Congress another excuse to continue backing the president.\\n\\nIt remains to be seen whether Trump or his fellow Republicans on the Supreme Court will decide to trigger the kind of crisis that would result if he openly defies the courts, or if the courts decide to place loyalty to the Republican Party over loyalty to the Constitution. For the moment, all we can do is wait and see if that crisis arrives.'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-13T18:19:00',\n",
       "   'content': '(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to this Post)\\n\\n\\n\\nBeing our semi-regular weekly survey of what’s goin’ down in the several states where, as we know, the real work of governmentin’ gets done and where nobody wants to marry your sister.\\n\\nWe begin in Idaho, where, against all possible odds, they elected a legislature even more wing-nutty than the previous one was. Now that legislature wants public school kids to learn all about the massacring and raping and pillars of fire in the good book. Then we can move on to math and working well with others. From the Idaho Statesman:\\n\\nThe bill, sponsored by Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene, would require verses of the Bible to be read daily, “without comment,” in all “occupied” classrooms at public schools, such that the entire Bible would be read over a 10-year period. The proposal would allow teachers to absent themselves from the readings if they have a “conscience” objection, and also allow students to skip participation if they have a note from their parents.\\n\\nI’m sure Rep, Redman will be all up in arms if the teacher who exercises a “conscience objection” is ostracized by the community and then, under ginned-up mock public rage, is fired by the local school board. And I am the Tsar of all the Russias.\\n\\nParents and other members of the public could sue if they believed the law was not being enforced, and a judge could order the school to comply, according to the bill. “This bill seeks to cultivate morality and encourage good citizenship,” Redman told a House committee Thursday. The Idaho Family Policy Center, a Christian lobbying group that has also previously written state laws that limit abortion and transgender rights, crafted the Bible bill. Blaine Conzatti, the group’s president, stressed Idaho’s history with religion during Thursday’s House committee hearing, adding that an Idaho law passed in 1925 required public school Bible reading.\\n\\nThis was all a “begat” too far even for several Republicans in the Idaho legislature.\\n\\nThree Republicans as well as the two Democrats on the House committee were skeptical of the new Idaho legislation. “This country was settled by people that weren’t moving to religion, they were moving away from state-mandated religion,” Rep. Jack Nelsen, R-Jerome, told the committee. “To me, this picks a particular religion’s Bible, and I am not for advancing this.” Rep. Dan Garner, R-Clifton, asked Conzatti whether Attorney General Raúl Labrador had given an opinion on the bill. Conzatti declined to respond. A spokesperson for Labrador’s office declined to comment.\\n\\nOnward, Christian soldiers, stonewall for the Lord...\\n\\nWe move on to Texas, where, since the state took over the public schools in Houston, people seem to want to know what the fck is going on there in greater numbers than ever before. From the Houston Chronicle:\\n\\nHISD reported an average of 530 open records requests in the four academic years before the Texas Education Agency’s intervention into the state’s largest district. The number of submitted annual records requests spiked to 1,174 during the 2023-24 school year, according to a Chronicle analysis. “If parents are feeling like something doesn’t add up, if they’re confused or if they’re frustrated, it’s one avenue that they can get more clear information to say, ‘OK, am I seeing this clearly or is there maybe something else going on?’ and that can help either confirm or help ease their concerns,” [community organizer Jessi] Heiner said. “Either way, it’s empowering.”\\n\\nIf the state wanted to empower parents, it wouldn’t have barged in and taken over in the first place.\\n\\nWe move along to Alabama, where the citizens of a state that gave the president 65 percent of their vote recently got a nice thank-you note from him in their energy bills. From Popular Information:\\n\\nBut hundreds of Alabama residents are receiving a $100 surcharge on their energy bills as a direct result of Trump’s actions in the White House. About 250 customers of Huntsville Utilities, the public utility company in Huntsville, Alabama, received a letter informing them that their account “has been debited $100.” The surcharge occurred because one of Trump’s executive orders froze a grant that assists low-income residents with their energy bills. In an email, Mike Presley of the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs confirmed that the letter from Huntsville Utilities was genuine and the $100 increase was the direct result of Trump’s executive order.\\n\\nWhen, oh Lord, when will the scales fall from their eyes? This appeal to heaven grows more futile by the day. Chances are they’ll just blame Obama.\\n\\nWe move along to Utah, where a unique naming controversy has broken out that has absolutely no connection to the Civil War or to cultural appropriation of Native lands. Instead, the controversy involves ... bugs. In 1848, one of the Utah’s regular biblical plagues of grasshoppers descended on the state, devouring the crops and threatening the new settlement with famine. The devout Mormon settlers took the biblical part of these plagues quite literally, so much so that the insects became known as “Mormon crickets,” even though they probably weren’t technically crickets.\\n\\nIn 1848, legend has it that the settlers were rescued by flocks of seagulls that descended on the state and set about eating all the crickets. This is why there is a seagull monument in Temple Square in Salt Lake City, and it’s also why the seagull, of all things, is the state bird of a completely landlocked state. Now, though, under debate in the state legislature is House Bill 348, which appeals to the Entomological Society of America to stop people calling the species “Mormon crickets.”\\n\\nHB348, Insect Terminology Amendments, by Rep. Doug Owens, petitions the Entomological Society of America to reference the species Anabrus Simplex (“Mormon cricket”) by a scientific or another common name in order to avoid association between this undesirable insect and Utah’s founders. The Legislature seems determined to erase all living references to the lore of a cricket scourge ended by pioneer prayers and insatiable appetites of seagulls. They previously (and unsuccessfully) attempted to change the state bird, the California Gull.\\n\\nThank Moroni that the legislature was prevented from dishonoring the seagull that way. It’s a pretty neat-looking statue, after all.\\n\\nAnd we conclude, as is our custom, and for the very last time on this side of the Atlantic, in the great state of Oklahoma, whence comes the last saga we will read under the tutelage of the man, the myth, the legend we call Friedman of the Plains. And he’s gone overseas. From Fox23:\\n\\nOklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt (R) dismissed three members of the Oklahoma State Board of Education Tuesday saying the board had become too political and lost focus on educating students. At the same time, the director of communications at the Oklahoma State Department of Education told news reporters his last day with the agency was Monday. Stitt immediately appointed three new board members and said members Sarah Lepak and Zach Archer were allowed to remain on the board. “Nothing is more important than ensuring Oklahoma kids have the best education possible,” Stitt stated in a news release. “After months of headlines followed by disappointing NAEP scores this month, it’s clear that our education infrastructure has fallen prey to needless political drama. If we want to be the best state for business, we need to make sure our kids have a path to success. It’s time for some fresh eyes and a renewed focus on our top ten goals.”\\n\\nAnd people say that conservatives don’t have a sense of humor. This is the guy who visited upon his state education superintendent Ryan Walters, aka Jesus’ Hall Monitor. Maybe Stitt is wising up to this. However, one of his new school-board members is a guy named Deatherage, and if there isn’t a metal band in Tulsa calling itself Deatherage by the end of the week, I will be very disappointed in Oklahoma.\\n\\nThis is your democracy, America. Cherish it.'}],\n",

       "   'content': 'Around this time four years ago, with Democrats in control of the White House, Senate and House, party leaders were well on their way to passing the American Rescue Plan, which helped turn the economy around after the 2020 recession. The legislative drive wasn’t effortless, but by mid-February 2021, a Democratic budget resolution had already passed both chambers.\\n\\nFour years later, it’s Republicans enjoying control of the White House and Capitol Hill, with major legislative ambitions of their own. Their efforts, however, aren’t going especially well.\\n\\nIt wasn’t long after Election Day 2024 when GOP officials began preliminary discussions about the scope and scale of the party’s congressional agenda. Republicans knew they would rely on the budget reconciliation process — a process that would allow GOP senators to circumvent Democrats and pass a bill through majority rule — but they also knew they had a myriad of tactical and substantive variables to consider.\\n\\nThe more Republican officials tried to settle on a solution, the more the party struggled to overcome its divisions. Many GOP senators endorsed a two-bill approach, the first of which would focus primarily on border security and give the White House an early victory, to be followed by a second bill prioritizing economy policy and tax cuts. Many House Republicans, meanwhile, demanded a one-bill approach — a “big, beautiful bill” — encompassing nearly all of Trump’s top legislative priorities.\\n\\nAs the intraparty fissures deepened, it became increasingly obvious that congressional leaders would need the president to help resolve the differences and negotiate a deal that Republican officials in both chambers could live with.\\n\\nIt also became increasingly obvious that Trump didn’t want to play such a role.\\n\\nAbout a week before his second inaugural, Trump met with House GOP lawmakers, who hoped to get some guidance on the budget fight. It was a bust: As The New York Times reported, Trump “equivocated and sent mixed signals.” The article added, “It was a familiar reprise for Republican leaders who were around during Mr. Trump’s first term to experience how his changing moods, shifting priorities and flashes of rage could sap their leverage and derail even their best-laid plans.”\\n\\nSoon after, he also met with Senate Republicans and sounded an “agnostic” note about the process.\\n\\nThe day after Inauguration Day, the new president huddled again with GOP lawmakers and again failed to offer any meaningful direction. The same week, Trump sat down in the Oval Office with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, who asked about the party’s legislative plans.\\n\\n“I don’t care as long as we get to the final answer,” the president said. “I like the concept of that one bill — I guess I said one big beautiful and that’s what everyone says. ... I do like that concept. It could be something else. It could be a smaller bill and a big bill.”\\n\\nThis, naturally, only fueled more intraparty chaos.\\n\\nTwo weeks later, Trump held yet another meeting with Republican members of Congress, and this time, the president sketched out several trillion dollars’ worth of tax cuts that he expected them to pass. He did not, however, offer any guidance on the differences between the House’s and the Senate’s preferred legislative strategy.\\n\\nLast week, at long last, Trump picked a side: As Senate Republicans prepared to advance their own budget plan, the president denounced their proposal and endorsed the one-bill strategy backed by House Republicans.\\n\\nThat announcement came on Wednesday. On Friday, just two days later, as Politico reported, Trump started equivocating again.\\n\\nDonald Trump is continuing to complicate the path forward for congressional Republicans, who are desperate for clarity on what the president wants them to do to enact his massive domestic agenda. In comments on Brian Kilmeade’s radio show Friday, Trump openly entertained a notion that the GOP’s efforts to extend expiring tax cuts with new policies on border security and energy production may need to be broken up into smaller bills to clear Congress.\\n\\nIn other words, congressional Republicans waited for presidential leadership for months on the party’s legislative agenda; Trump finally made a decision that cut Senate GOP leaders off at the knees; and the president hedged on his own policy 48 hours later, creating a new round of uncertainty.\\n\\nThere’s room for debate as to why Trump refuses to help lead his own party, but given his record, it’s not because he’s struggling to decide between two competing ideas. Rather, it’s easier to believe that he’s failed to help congressional Republicans because the president knows effectively nothing about legislating, policymaking and governing.\\n\\nTo be sure, GOP leaders might somehow manage to overcome their difficulties and pass a bill or two anyway. But if they do, it will be despite Trump’s efforts, not because of them.'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-21T19:42:21',\n",
       "   'content': 'This is an adapted excerpt from the Feb. 20 episode of “The Rachel Maddow Show.”\\n\\nFor 26 years, the state of Missouri was represented in Congress by Republican Roy Blunt. He began as Rep. Blunt, serving in House Republican leadership for years, before becoming a senator.\\n\\nBlunt, among everything else he did during his time in office, was a persistent advocate for funding Alzheimer’s research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). When Blunt announced in 2021 that he was retiring from office, the NIH decided to dedicate their very important Alzheimer’s research center to him. They called it the Roy Blunt Center for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias Research.\\n\\nCole made the point that funding that Alzheimer’s center is not just a good thing to do, it also saves the government money in the long run.\\n\\nAt the dedication ceremony, in 2022, Blunt talked about the importance of NIH funding and Alzheimer’s research funding specifically. A bunch of other Republicans from Congress showed up as well and stressed how important it was to fund that specific program. Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma told the crowd, “To be able to do what we’ve done, a fivefold increase in Alzheimer’s and dementia research is a very special thing.\"\\n\\n“This is our most expensive disease,” he continued. “And you can look at the trendline of what it costs to pay for Alzheimer’s and you’ll pretty quickly make the point that it’s cheaper to try and cure it, or at least manage it and delay it, than it is to deal with it. And that has really guided the investments here more than anything else.”\\n\\nCole made the point that funding this specific Alzheimer’s center is not just a good thing to do, it also saves the government money in the long run. But, you can probably guess where this is headed.\\n\\nThis week, The New Republic reported that the Trump administration has now slashed funding to that Republican-beloved Alzheimer’s center. Approximately one-tenth of the center’s workers have now been let go, including its incoming director, “a highly regarded scientist credited with important innovations in the field,\" people familiar with the situation told The New Republic.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, senior member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said senior scientists and the center\\'s acting director were fired by the Trump administration.\\n\\nCole’s office did not respond to a request for comment about these reported cuts, but Michael Greicius, a neurologist at Stanford University, explained to The New Republic the devastating impact closing the center would have on Alzheimer’s research. “[The center] has developed infrastructure and a brain trust that’s really unmatched in the world, in terms of its advances in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s,” he said. “Weakening [it] will set Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s research back substantially.”\\n\\nIf you’re looking for a poster child for something this administration is doing that has no apparent support from anyone — and that can be expected to have not just public opposition and expert opposition but specifically Republican opposition — I think you’ve got your winner.'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-24T11:00:41',\n",
       "   'content': 'Donald Trump has always had trouble keeping a story straight. But even by his own standards, the president’s flip-flop last week on Medicaid cuts was executed with dizzying speed. That pirouette should worry not only the millions of Americans on Medicaid, but those drawing Medicare and even Social Security benefits as well.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Trump and unofficial co-president Elon Musk sat for an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity. “Social Security won’t be touched, other than this fraud or something we’re going to find,” Trump said. “It’s going to be strengthened but won’t be touched. Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched.”\\n\\nThe president’s words seemed unambiguous and reflected three facts: The health care programs insure nearly 40% of Americans, more than 70 million Americans receive Social Security benefits, and all three programs are remarkably popular.\\n\\nDespite the president’s promise the night before on Fox, the House GOP budget leaves Medicaid anything but “untouched.”\\n\\nOn his Truth Social platform the next morning, however, Trump posted an endorsement of the House GOP’s budget plan. “The House Resolution implements my FULL America First Agenda,” Trump wrote with his trademark restraint. “It will, without question, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\\n\\nThat endorsement created a contradiction that, according to Politico, “sent aides scrambling to figure out what Trump meant.” Despite the president’s promise the night before on Fox, the House GOP budget leaves Medicaid anything but “untouched.”\\n\\nThe “full America First agenda” that Trump is so jazzed about will cost around $4.8 trillion, a combination of lower revenue and spending cuts. The vast majority of that — $4.5 trillion — comes as tax cuts, mostly an extension of the 2017 tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefited wealthy Americans. To make that cost more palatable to the far right’s deficit hawks, the budget asks approximately half a dozen House committees to find $2 trillion in spending cuts. The largest reductions — $880 billion — will come via the Energy and Commerce Committee, with most or all of that figure likely to come from Medicaid.\\n\\nThere’s no easy way for Trump to reconcile his words with his favored budget. The White House insists that Trump is merely talking about “waste, fraud and abuse” in Medicare, but hasn’t provided evidence that any of those three are widespread, let alone in quantities sufficient to reach the $880 billion target. In fact, as a group of House GOP moderates warned Speaker Mike Johnson in a letter last week, “For many families across the country, Medicaid is their only access to healthcare. Slashing Medicaid would have serious consequences.”\\n\\nBut it’s not just the 79 million Americans on Medicaid who should be worried. Despite what Trump claimed, the House budget is not his “full agenda.” Many of Trump’s most expensive campaign promises, including the elimination of taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security payments, aren’t included. In addition, Republicans from high-tax states have vowed to eliminate or at least significantly lift the cap on deducting state and local taxes.\\n\\nThere are already indications that Medicare could be vulnerable.\\n\\nPassing everything on this list would require trillions more in spending cuts — well beyond the even deeper Medicaid cuts envisioned by the most conservative Republicans. If Trump only needed 12 hours to go all-in on slashing Medicaid to fund giveaways to the wealthy, why should anyone expect other entitlements to be off the table?\\n\\nThere are already indications that Medicare could be vulnerable. Medicare’s pandemic-era expansion of telehealth services is set to expire in April, after a two-year extension was a casualty of Republicans blowing up the last round of congressional budget negotiations in December. And the same day that Trump backed the House budget, White House spokesperson Kush Desai issued a statement saying that “the Trump administration is committed to protecting Medicare and Medicaid while slashing the waste, fraud, and abuse within those programs.” Only after news outlets noted Medicare’s inclusion did Desai issue an updated statement without any mention of the program.\\n\\nA day later, Senate Republicans dispelled any doubts that Congress would support Medicare cuts should Trump request them. As the Senate GOP moved forward with a vote on its own budget resolution, Democratic Sen. Jack Reed offered an amendment barring Medicare and Medicaid cuts. Every Democrat voted for the amendment; all but two Republicans voted against it.\\n\\nThat leaves Social Security, traditionally the most protected program in American politics. But in the Fox News interview, it was Social Security, not Medicare or Medicaid, that Trump noted may be probed for “fraud or something we’re going to find.” Trump, Musk and the latter’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency have already pushed claims of rampant fraud that have fallen apart under the slightest scrutiny. Both men have claimed, for example, that “millions and millions” of dead people receive Social Security — a claim that Trump’s new commissioner of the Social Security Administration has debunked.\\n\\nThe president may persist with this fraud about “fraud” because, as with the GOP budget, the math isn’t kind to Trump. As I wrote in October, “the Congressional Budget Office projects that the [Social Security] trust fund will run out before 2035. At that point, benefits will immediately shrink by more than 20%, around $400 per month per recipient on average.” But the policies that Trump trumpeted during the campaign will accelerate that timeline: Mass deportations mean fewer workers paying payroll taxes; additional tax cuts reduce revenues; and new tariffs are likely to boost inflation and, consequently, Social Security’s cost-of-living increases. Taking all of Trump’s proposals together, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget projects that Social Security’s trust fund would run out by 2031.\\n\\nThe easy solution here would be to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans, either by ending their portion of the 2017 tax cuts or lifting the cap on payroll taxes. Both are nonstarters for Republicans. So how will the ruling party deal with Social Security’s looming cliff? It’s not clear. But when Trump promises that Social Security will not be cut, remember that he and his allies are already laying the groundwork to turn “no cuts” into “big cuts” overnight.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'WASHINGTON — House Republican leaders are eying a high-stakes vote this week on a sweeping budget resolution to pass President Donald Trump\\'s agenda of trillions of dollars in tax cuts and additional funds for immigration enforcement.\\n\\nWith a majority of 218-215 and no hope of winning Democratic votes, Republicans have almost no margin for error: they can only afford one GOP defection to assure passage of the budget blueprint. If it passes, it would instruct committees to write a sweeping package involving taxes, immigration, military spending and energy policy that can be fast-tracked to the House floor for a vote.\\n\\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Monday afternoon that there “may be more than one” Republican opponent of the measure currently, but predicted that “we’re going to get everybody there.”\\n\\n“This is a prayer request. Just pray this through for us, because it is very high stakes,” he said at an event hosted by the conservative group Americans For Prosperity. “The thing about having a small majority is it brings great clarity. It’s clarifying. I don’t think anybody wants to be in front of this train.”\\n\\nOver the weekend, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus, said he was worried that some of his GOP colleagues are backtracking on the deficit-reduction targets.\\n\\n\"I supported it in committee — and am open to supporting it going forward — as a framework to see how much Republicans are willing to finally deliver. But statements by some of my colleagues (House & Senate) leave that in doubt,\" Roy wrote Sunday on X. \"We’re past the time for excuses.\"\\n\\nThe mercurial Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., responded to Roy in a Monday post on X, saying she\\'s \"a NO on the current version\" of the budget resolution, citing concerns about too much spending.\\n\\nRep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, said he\\'s undecided, saying that it\\'s \"important for the Hispanic Conference to have a seat at the table\" and that his priorities include lowering taxes, reducing inflation and cutting regulations \"because most Hispanic businesses are small businesses\" and often family-owned.\\n\\n\"Folks always talk about Hispanic outreach,\" he said. \"Hispanic Conference is the real life walking talking Hispanic outreach.\"\\n\\nJohnson and his House allies have insisted on passing Trump\\'s legislative agenda in one massive bill, clashing with Senate Republicans who want to break it up into two. Trump has publicly sided with the House\\'s path, but if the vote fails, Republicans may have to fall back on the $340 billion Senate budget resolution, which was adopted by the chamber last week. That version deals with the immigration, defense and energy portions of the GOP plan while leaving the tax debate for another measure.\\n\\n“My math is much more complicated in the house than the Senate. For the first time in our lifetime, Senate Republicans have a wider margin than we have in the House,” Johnson said, adding that he has “a much more diverse caucus” than the Senate GOP, including members from districts that former Vice President Kamala Harris won last fall, who have regional concerns.\\n\\n“So finding the right point for all those dials is going to be the trick,” he said. “Over the next several weeks, we’ll get there. And is the sooner that we do, the better it’s going to be.”\\n\\nRepublicans plan to vote on the measure Monday in the House Rules Committee, where they have a 9-4 majority and will likely have the votes to send it to the House floor.\\n\\nThey may be helped somewhat by potential absences among Democratic lawmakers, due to health reasons and other matters.\\n\\nThe vote comes as Democrats rally in opposition, with Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., pressing his members to show up.\\n\\n\"Given the expected closeness of the vote, it’s imperative that we are present with maximum attendance,\" he wrote in a letter to colleagues Monday, adding that \"far-right extremists are determined to push through $4.5 trillion of tax breaks for wealthy Republican donors and well-connected corporations, explode the debt and saddle everyday Americans with the bill by ending Medicaid as we know it. We must be at full strength to enhance our opportunity to stop the GOP Tax Scam in its tracks.\"\\n\\nDemocrats have zeroed in on language in the budget that requires the House Energy and Commerce Committee to cut spending by a hefty $880 billion. The panel oversees Medicaid, which some Republicans are targeting for spending cuts, eying new policies like work requirements to raise the bar for accessing benefits.\\n\\nA recent poll conducted by Fabrizio Ward, the firm helmed by Trump\\'s longtime pollster Tony Fabrizio, surveyed 18 swing congressional districts on behalf of the Republican-aligned nonprofit Building America\\'s Future.\\n\\nIt found that that health care costs were a major concern for both swing voters and Trump voters. Among the policies it tested, the most favorable reaction was on extending the expiring tax credits for buying health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, which Democrats first passed in 2021 and renewed in 2022.\\n\\nBob Ward, one of the pollsters who conducted it, warned Republicans to tread carefully when it comes to health care benefits.\\n\\n“Find ways to pay for your tax priorities that don’t hurt working families, many of whom, and in some districts — most of whom — are your own voters,” Ward told NBC News. “Taking away peoples health insurance is neither fiscally prudent nor politically smart.”'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-12T22:37:00',\n",
       "   'content': 'The House Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene presiding, held its first public hearing on Wednesday. By now, things being what they are, most congressional hearings are empty farces, the partisan divisions clearly drawn and defended almost without question. Witness the confirmation hearings of the various Trump nominees. Even the most controversial ones felt comfortable barbering the truth in the most obvious ways. (Kash Patel is the latest contestant to win a sleek new government job in these kabuki quiz shows.) But even by these shabby standards, the Marge show in the House was a DOGE and pony show of the lowest order. The Republicans railed about “waste, fraud, and abuse,” their mantra for the past century, at least. The Democrats railed against the cargo-shorts cargo cult and the swath of destruction it’s leaving behind it in the federal government. Chairman Marge filled the role of cheer-squad captain for the administration.\\n\\nThe American people’s anger over this betrayal is what gave birth to the concept of DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency. In fact, DOGE became a major part of President Trump’s campaign and led to his overwhelming victory in November. Every day, Americans go to work, they run businesses, they have to earn their paycheck, no one guarantees it, and if they don’t do a good job, they get fired. They also have to pay their bills, credit card debt, balance checkbooks, and scrap and save every penny they can to plan for that rainy day and hopefully retirement one day. Private businesses only survive on hard earned income. By serving their customers so well that their customers pay them for the services and products they consume. If that business fails, its employees lose their jobs and paychecks, and the owners lose their business and everything they risked along with it. Many go bankrupt in this process. No one bails them out. They only survived by excellent customer service and smart financial management. This is the real world that most Americans live, work, and survive in every day.\\n\\nMarge lives in a lovely world where health-insurance companies never gouge their customers, credit-card companies never jack up their interest rates, corporations don’t buy politicians, and serving this particular president while saying, “MANY GO BANKRUPT IN THIS PROCESS … NO ONE BAILS THEM OUT,” is one of the funniest goddamn things I’ve ever heard—or would be, if all those ordinary Americans weren’t terrified at the moment that their Social Security benefit may be being used as a mushroom by a teenager playing Centipede with the federal budget.\\n\\nAmong the Democrats, Rep. Robert Garcia of California made a meal out of He Who Shall Not Be Named, the Republicans being notably reluctant to talk about Elon Musk. He even cracked wise at the chair’s expense.\\n\\nWe should not stand by as the richest man on the planet gives himself and his companies huge tax cuts while the American people get absolutely nothing. I find it ironic that our chairwoman, Congresswoman Greene, is in charge of running this committee. In the last Congress in our oversight congressional hearing, the chairwoman literally showed a dick pic, so I thought I would bring one as well.\\n\\nAt which point, Garcia put up a large photo of a man he called “President Elon Musk.” Hardly anyone laughed.\\n\\nHe is also the world’s richest man. He was the biggest political donor in the last election. He has billions of dollars in conflicts of interest, and we know he is leading a power grab also abided by and encouraged by Donald Trump and the chairwoman, Congresswoman Greene. But I also want to run through what DOGE is actually going to do. It is a demolition plan that will run through our government.\\n\\nBut it was Texas Rep. Greg Casar, in his questioning of a witness, who made the most compelling argument about Musk and the Republicans’ efforts.\\n\\nAt least five inspector generals that were looking into Elon Musk’s companies were fired by the Trump–Musk administration. These inspector generals, who were independent, protected by law, the people who find the waste, fraud, and abuse, they were fired because they were looking into Elon Musk. The National Labor Relations Board, which is supposed to protect workers from getting their unions busted by folks like Elon Musk, has been functionally broken by the Department of Government Efficiency.... They are trying to shut down the Department of Education, the Department of Labor. Do you know what Elon Musk does not seem to be looking into? His own contracts. Do you know how much money a day Mr. Musk will receive from the federal government?\\n\\nThe answer is $8 million a day. Just last year he was promised $3 billion from close to one hundred contracts with the federal government. Do you know how much the average person in this country who survives on Social Security, a senior who has worked their entire life, has to survive on? Sixty-five dollars a day. This subcommittee, chaired by Marjorie Taylor Greene, is looking into your grandmother’s $65 a day.\\n\\nI think we would all support taxpayer savings. Look into money we might needlessly send to billionaires and big corporations. Find taxpayer savings and send it back to your hard-working families. But instead what Republicans and the Trump–Musk administration want to do is look into your kid’s lunch money. Your kid’s teacher’s salary. Your grandparents’ Social Security. They want to take that money and give it out in billionaire tax cuts, and they are talking about that at committee tomorrow. They just released their plan. When Republicans talk about government efficiency in this Congress, they are not looking into billionaires who do not pay their taxes. They are not looking into Elon Musk firing watchdogs who are supposed to keep him accountable. They are looking at cutting your public schools. They’re going straight for Social Security. They’re coming straight for cancer research. They are not looking at Big Tech or Big Pharma, because those people fund their campaigns. If this committee was serious, this meeting would be about how Musk and Donald Trump are firing the independent watchdogs who have done this for decades. Instead, the goal of this committee is to distract from Trump and Musk’s corrupt war on accountability. This will not be a subcommittee dedicated to making government efficient for everyday people. It is about helping Elon Musk and Donald Trump be efficient as possible in robbing our government and handing out our government services to the rich.\\n\\nPoints to Casar for talking plainly about what so many people are not talking about—the pillaging of the federal treasury by a whack-job billionaire and his cadre of postadolescent goons. But the hearing proved nothing, changed nothing, and advanced nothing. The only person who made sense was witness Stewart Whitson, who actually talked about returning the power of the purse to Congress. This got him props from Rep. Jasmine Crockett, another Texas Democrat.\\n\\nThere are things such as impoundment because, as Mr. Whitson said, we need to return the power of the purse to Congress. It never left. According to the Constitution, that is where it is at. People are confused because they were upset about the guy who runs Twitter, who for sure is doing the various things. If you are trying to conduct audits, I don’t know why you go to some tech guy. It was only techies who were sitting there at the inauguration.\\n\\nBipartisanship!'}],\n",

       "   'content': 'Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\\n\\nOn Tuesday evening, my phone erupted with a notification that, for once in the last hellish month, was not about the forced implosion of the American system of government: “These beans went viral,” the New York Times Cooking app proclaimed. Hmm, viral beans, in this quad-demic? I love beans, so following my reckless curiosity, I tapped through. But I needn’t have bothered—these were those beans, the “Creamy, Spicy Tomato Beans and Greens” that everyone has been losing it over for the past month.\\n\\nWhen you look at the recipe, from senior staff editor Alexa Weibel, you may notice that it was originally published in April of last year. It is not new! Indeed, it was one of the paper’s most popular recipes of 2024, but it seems only to have become “The Beans” to online fans in recent weeks. I started seeing them on Instagram in the latter days of January, and there’s a popular Reddit rave from Jan. 29: “I have ascended. I have seen the face of true comfort, and it is this dish. I took one bite, and suddenly, all was right in the world.” The Times savvily capitalized on this enthusiasm with a Feb. 6 Cooking newsletter, spurring a virtuous cycle of buzz among influencers and on social media, particularly Reddit, where there is a thriving “megathread” dedicated to celebrating The Beans and divining their secrets. Countless skillets are undoubtedly simmering away across the country as we speak.\\n\\nJust what is it about The Beans that makes them so transporting? We can stipulate from the start that they are very good. But ascension good? After happily chewing on them for a few days (excellent leftovers!), I think I have an idea—a humble contribution to Beanology I’d like to share.\\n\\nAt first glance, what we have here is one of those weeknight-friendly, pantry-staple toss-togethers, composed primarily of white beans, tomato paste, and cream, with a jaunty little arugula salad hat. The Beans benefit from truth in advertising—they are indeed creamy (from both the flesh of the partially collapsing beans, and dairy), a little spicy (red pepper flakes), and contain an enjoyable amount of the three named ingredients, not to mention a shower of fried breadcrumbs and pecorino. But there’s a flavor element here, one that emerges only in the final, combined bite, that I believe is the true reason for all the hoopla: The answer to The Beans’ allure, I submit to the committee, is tang.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe Beans are tangy! Some readers will immediately know what I mean by this, but my research suggests that tanginess is undertheorized and not widely enough appreciated. Indeed, I consulted a number of my cooking reference books—the Diner’s Dictionary, the Flavor Thesaurus, the Flavor Bible itself—and found not one entry. Google will return general definitions that are kind of all over the place, circling around the idea of sourness or, even more vaguely, a sharp or strong flavor. But these are facile and inadequate—we can do better.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe lone description for tang that I could find online that actually gets us anywhere comes, interestingly enough, from a website about tea: “An intensely piercing sweet and sour impression along the sides of the tongue.” What I like about this is that it conveys not only the basic taste buds involved, but also something like mouthfeel. And in my experience as a lover of the tangy—my palate was shaped in the South, where tang infuses much of the cuisine, from mustardy Carolina barbecue to collard greens, to coleslaw—it is not just a flavor, like sour or bitter, but a whole-mouth phenomenon.\\n\\nSo, the first expansion I’d propose to our understanding of tang is that, yes, it is sour or acidic, but the full sensation is one of those flavors cutting through fat. There may or may not be sweetness or spice involved (though, for me, a certain sense of sweetness often accompanies the presence of fat in a dish), but there is always that feeling of something bold and biting, “piercing,” as the tea people put it, through some unctuous resistance.\\n\\nRelated From Slate One of the Great Secret-Ingredient Mysteries of Our Time Has Finally Been Solved Read More\\n\\nI mentioned BBQ—there, we have the zip of the mustard playing against the fatty pork. With slaw, it’s vinegar against mayonnaise (preferably Duke’s, which has “twang” right there on the bottle). In the case of The Beans, tang’s incursion comes—and this, I think, is the key to its star power—from an unexpected source: sun-dried tomatoes. Reader, I will admit that when I noticed this ’80s throwback in the recipe’s ingredient list, I was skeptical; I almost left it off my shopping list. When I did get a jar home, I tried one directly, and it was a revelation unto itself—bright, acidic tomato dancing through the olive oil. (Tip: Buy high-quality oil-packed varieties, such as Alessi, to avoid the dusty commercial flavor that haunts so many of us who ate these back in the day.) And in The Beans, the tomatoes, which are chopped and added before the simmer, do a similar little jig, singing through the cream. In a dish that I had expected to be pure comfort mush (+ salad), this note of tang was a little thrill, like a handsome stranger catching your eye across the bar, if the stranger were a confit of desiccated tomatoes and your eye was your tongue.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThis is probably getting to be enough words about some tangy beans, but I can’t resist adding a few parting thoughts. Like handsome strangers, tang leaves you wanting more. Its presence in your mouth is striking, jarring, almost uncomfortable; as with very spicy foods, you may find yourself desiring to repeat the zap, spoonful after spoonful—people certainly have had this experience with The Beans. And last, a provocation for us to ponder: The more I reflect on it, the more I think tang almost tastes … spoiled. There’s a whisper of something off about it, a visceral riskiness that stirs and titillates as acid transgresses fat. (The combination of these two elements can, after all, turn into something rancid.) Could this kill me? your brain stem asks. No. But that it doesn’t, that you’ve eaten on the edge and survived, is maybe where the pleasure lies.\\n\\nOr maybe I’m reading too much into it. They’re just beans. Regardless, I think we could all use a little brightness and sensual excitement in our lives right now. So recipe writers, listen up—more of this, please! We promise there’s viral gold in them tangy hills.'},\n",

       "   'time': '2025-02-23T12:00:00',\n",
       "   'content': 'This is One Thing, a column with tips on how to live.\\n\\nImagine it: A person bakes a cake. A group of friends come together at someone’s home. There are snacks, as well as cups of tea and coffee. There are (multiple) bottles of prosecco and fancy seltzers. The creator of the cake stands to present her bake. A cellphone camera is produced, ready to capture the moment for posterity. A voice is heard above the soft murmur of side conversation. “Tell us about your cake!” The friends ooh and aah while the baker describes the flavors and the method she used for the buttercream. (“Infuse your buttercream,” she implores.) The crowd cheers in anticipatory delight because the best part about Cake Club is finally here: You get to savor the cake and eat it too.\\n\\nCake Club began because, well, I wanted to bake more cakes. Or maybe it was because my friend Chelsea wanted to start baking cakes. Either way, I know that it was Michele who said, “Let’s get together and eat some cake,” then organized a time, a place, and a group to enjoy Chelsea’s first attempt: an Italian cream cake, filled with toasted coconut and pecans, decorated—expertly, I must say—with whorls of tangy cream cheese frosting. About three years later, Cake Club remains one of the most rewarding things I do with my friends, and something that literally anyone cake-inclined can and should do.\\n\\nThe rules of Cake Club are simple. First, someone makes something that is generally considered a dessert. Yes, Cake Club can accommodate sweets beyond the realm of cake. We’ve had people make all sorts of things that aren’t exactly cakes: We’ve had babka, tiramisu, petits fours. I once made a sweet pizza with a rough puff pastry, honey-lemon pesto, and charred peaches, topped with whipped ricotta. I personally have banned cookies from Cake Club, for what some might deem arbitrary reasons. I feel strongly that a Cake Club dessert should have either a cut-into-it element or a cake base. I haven’t made a ruling on cookie cakes yet, but I’m leaning toward allowing them.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe second rule of Cake Club is, you must come together in the same location to enjoy the dessert. There is no Cake Club over Zoom! We try to alternate apartments and will sometimes have a different host from whoever is baking. Splitting up the baking and hosting duties also spreads out the financial burden, as does meeting only once a month. We all believe in the community of Cake Club and know that what goes around comes around, in the end.\\n\\nRule 3 is that every bake must be presented to the group before anyone gets a slice. This is my favorite part because there is so much appreciation shared for the person who has baked. This probably started because we all watched a LOT of Great British Bake Off and wanted to pretend we were contestants on the show. I started recording the presentations because I knew I wanted to have them for something … eventually (I still don’t know what). Although I’ve posted Cake Club snippets to social media from time to time, getting likes is not the point. Frosting is.\\n\\nRule 4 is crucial, and yet perhaps the most controversial, at least with the loved ones of Cake Club members: There should be no leftovers at the end. And with a crew of seven or eight, we almost never fail, so those loved ones rarely get to enjoy a bite, even if the gathering is happening in their own home. Sad but true.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThough we keep it pretty exclusive, every once in a while, guests are invited in to celebrate a birthday or another holiday, and we’ve been lucky that a few of them have stuck around! To become a permanent member, someone must make a thing or host a Cake Club event, but there’s no time limit on doing this.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAt this year’s January Cake Club (which featured a London Fog cake with the aforementioned Earl Grey–infused buttercream), I got to meet my friend’s baby for the first time. Sitting with her kid, I felt a sense of joy as I thought about how, one day, she’ll be old enough to start her own Cake Club. It might not look exactly how ours does, but I hope that our Cake Club inspires her—and you—to create a space where gratitude is the vibe and a well-baked crumb is shared freely and passionately among friends.'}]}"
