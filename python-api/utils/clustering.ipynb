President Joe Biden issued pardons to several close family members Monday inthe final minutes of his presidency. \"My family has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats, motivated solely by a desire to hurt me -- the worst kind of partisan politics,\" Biden wrote in a statement.\\xa0\"Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe these attacks will end.\" \"That is why I am exercising my power under the Constitution to pardon James B. Biden, Sara Jones Biden, Valerie Biden Owens, John T. Owens, and Francis W. Biden,\" he continued. \"The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that they engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense.\" The five preemptive pardons were issued to James Biden, Joe\\'s younger brother; Sara Jones Biden, James\\' wife; Valerie Biden Owens, Joe\\'s younger sister; John T. Owens\\', Valerie\\'s husband; and Francis W. Biden, Joe\\'s younger brother. While he was sitting in the Capitol Rotunda attending the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, Biden announced the preemptive pardons for his siblings and in-laws. \"I believe in the rule of law, and I am optimistic that the strength of our legal institutions will ultimately prevail over politics. But baseless and politically motivated investigations wreak havoc on the lives, safety, and financial security of targeted individuals and their families. Even when individuals have done nothing wrong and will ultimately be exonerated, the mere fact of being investigated or prosecuted can irreparably damage their reputations and finance,\" Biden said. \"The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that they engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense,\" Biden said. This comes afterBiden issued a controversial pardonfor his son, Hunter Biden, in early December over tax evasion and federal gun charges. Biden had repeatedly said he did not plan to pardon Hunter. James Biden, 75, has especially come under fire from Republicans. Congressional Republicans have pressed the incoming Justice Department to bring charges against James Biden for allegedly lying to Congress as part of its impeachment inquiry into the outgoing president and his family. Paul Fishman, an attorney who represents James and Sara Biden, said in a statement to ABC News, \"Jim and Sara Biden did not seek this pardon because they have never committed any crimes. But for the reasons the President described, they have accepted it.\" James Comer, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, wrote to incoming Attorney General Pam Bondi on Friday seeking to hold James Biden accountable for \"having misled Congress regarding Joe Biden\\'s participation in his family\\'s influence peddling and deserving of prosecution under federal law.\" Comer and his Republican colleagues had already issued a criminal referral for James Biden to the Justice Department. Comer reacted to the preemptive pardons of Biden\\'s family, saying they serve as \"a confession of their corruption.\" The pardon warrant, signed Jan. 19, excuses James Biden and the other family members of \"ANY NONVIOLENT OFFENSES against the United States which they may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014, through the date of this pardon.\" These were the second preemptive pardons issued by the outgoing president on Monday, not an unusual act for departing leaders. He also issued pardons to potential targets of the incoming Trump administration, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, retired Gen. Mark Milley and lawmakers who served on the House Jan. 6 committee. \"Our nation relies on dedicated, selfless public servants every day. They are the lifeblood of our democracy,\" Biden said in a statement. \"Yet alarmingly, public servants have been subjected to ongoing threats and intimidation for faithfully discharging their duties.\" ABC News\\' Alexandra Hutzler contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events',\n",

       "   'content': 'Watch CBS News ByKaia Hubbard,Caroline Linton Updated on:  January 20, 2025 / 12:09 PM EST/ CBS News Washington— President Biden announced Monday before leaving office that he would bepreemptively pardoningseveral people who could be targeted with President-elect Donald Trump\\'sreturnto the White House, including members of his family, Dr.Anthony Fauci, GeneralMark A. Milleyand members of theHouse Jan. 6 committeeand their staff. Just 20 minutes before handing over power to Trump, Mr. Biden also announced he was preemptively pardoning his brothers, sister-in-law, sister and brother-in-law. \"My family has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats, motivated solely by a desire to hurt me—the worst kind of partisan politics,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe these attacks will end. ...\\xa0 Even when individuals have done nothing wrong and will ultimately be exonerated, the mere fact of being investigated or prosecuted can irreparably damage their reputations and finances.\" A source familiar with the decision tells CBS News he made the decision to pardon his siblings and their spouses \"in the last few days\" amid the \"continuing talk and concern about possible persecution and prosecution\" by the new administration. Mr. Biden issued preemptive pardons for Fauci, Milley and others earlier in the morning. \"These public servants have served our nation with honor and distinction and do not deserve to be the targets of unjustified and politically motivated prosecutions,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement. The president noted that the pardons \"should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense.\" He added that the nation instead \"owes these public servants a debt of gratitude for their tireless commitment to our country.\" Mr. Biden praised the service of Fauci, who worked for decades as the nation\\'s top infectious disease expert; Milley, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and the members of the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and their staff, who the president said worked with \"integrity and a commitment to discovering the truth.\" The individuals have all been the subject of GOP ire and threats of retribution for perceived wrongdoings. The president said he believes in the rule of law and is \"optimistic that the strength of our legal institutions will ultimately prevail over politics.\" But he added that \"these are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing.\" Fauci issued a statement on Monday after the pardon news saying that he is grateful for the action. \"Despite the accomplishments that my colleagues and I achieved over my long career of public service, I have been the subject of politically motivated threats of investigation and prosecution,\" Fauci said. \"There is absolutely no basis for these threats. Let me be perfectly clear: I have committed no crime and there are no possible grounds for any allegation or threat of criminal investigation or prosecution of me. The fact is, however, that the mere articulation of these baseless threats, and the potential that they will be acted upon, create immeasurable and intolerable distress for me and my family.\" Milley said in a statement after Mr. Biden\\'s announcement Monday that he and his family \"are deeply grateful for the President\\'s action today.\" \"After forty-three years of faithful service in uniform to our Nation, protecting and defending the Constitution, I do not wish to spend whatever remaining time the Lord grants me fighting those who unjustly might seek retribution for perceived slights,\" Milley said. Rep. Bennie Thompson, who had been the chair of the Jan. 6 select committee, and former Rep. Liz Cheney, the Republican who had served as the vice chair, issued a joint statement on Monday expressing gratitude for the pardons due to the \"extraordinary circumstances.\" \"Such a prosecution would be ordered and conducted by persons who led this unprecedented attack on our constitutional system. We are not deterred, we have never been deterred, and we will never be deterred by threats of criminal violence or criminal prosecution, and we are encouraged greatly by the rule of law by the existence of the Constitution\\'s Speech and Debate clause as well as this general pardon by President Biden of our Committee and its excellent staff.\" Speculation about the possibility of preemptive pardons for members of the Jan. 6 committee has circulated in recent days. Trump has accused members of the committee of destroying evidence and committing \"a major crime\" during their investigation. He told NBC\\'s \"Meet the Press\" last month that \"everybody\" who served on the committee \"should go to jail.\" Trump aideTaylor Budowich posted on social mediathat Mr. Biden \"unilaterally shielded a group of political cronies from the scales of justice. This is yet another dangerous and unreversible erosion of American norms.\" Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a Trump ally, told CBS News about the pardons said that Republicans have not indicated they would \"definitely go after the individuals,\" so \"why would he be preemptive to put out a pardon if they didn\\'t do anything wrong?\" Mr. Biden was criticized in December when heissued a sweeping, preemptive pardonof his son Hunter for any crimes Hunter Biden may have committed from Jan. 1, 2014, through Dec. 1, 2024. Hunter Biden wasconvicted in June of three separate felony chargesrelated to his purchase of a revolver in 2018 when he was battling an addiction to illegal drugs, which he lied about on paperwork to obtain the gun. He also pleaded guilty tonine tax evasion chargesin a separate case in September. Thompsontold CBS News last weekthat he would accept a preemptive pardon, saying that \"if for Bennie Thompson, that is something that\\'s offered to me, I will accept it.\" \"Because there are a lot of people who take this person at his word, and I don\\'t want him to weaponize (the) government against people for doing their job,\" Thompson said. Still, other members of the committee have said they were not in favor of pardons. \"We didn\\'t do anything wrong,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar, a Democrat of California. Former Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois said he understands \"understand the theory behind it because Donald Trump has clearly said he\\'s going to go after everybody,\" but he added \"the second you take a pardon, it looks like you\\'re guilty of something.\" \"I\\'m guilty of nothing besides bringing the truth to the American people and in the process, embarrassing Donald Trump,\" Kinzinger told CNN. The panel\\'s other Republican, former Rep. Liz Cheney, had been the subject of Trump\\'s ire since her work on the committee, with Trump successfully backing a primary challenger. During the campaign, Trump called her a \"war hawk\" and a \"stupid person,\" and said \"let\\'s see how she feels about it, you know when the guns are trained on her face.\" Mr. Biden awarded Cheney and Thompson with thePresidential Citizens Medal, the second-highest civilian award, at a ceremony at the White House this month. The move comes as the president has in recent weeks made more individual pardons and commutations than any other President in history, commuting the sentences ofaround 1,500 peopleand pardoning nearly 40 Americans convicted of nonviolent crimes in December, along with commuting the sentences ofalmost 2,500 peopleon Friday.

       "   'content': ' Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Just minutes before leaving office, Joe Biden announced a set of sweeping pre-emptive pardons to members of his family, including his two brothers and his sister, after some on the right suggested the they should face prosecution. The announcement — a move Biden once said would not be indicative of his administration — came ahead of theinauguration ceremony for Donald Trump, who was sworn in as the 47th president on Monday. \"My family has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats, motivated solely by a desire to hurt me — the worst kind of partisan politics,\" Biden said in a statement.\\xa0\"Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe these attacks will end.\" In an interview with CNN in 2020, Biden criticized the notion of an outgoing presidentpre-emptively pardoning family members. At the time, it was suggested that it was such a move Trump might take. “It concerns me, in terms of what kind of precedent it sets and how the rest of the world looks at us as a nation of laws and justice,” Biden said then. “Now, in terms of the pardons, you’re not going to see, in our administration, that kind of approach.” The pardons quickly drew claims of hypocrisy from Republicans. Alex Pfeiffer, a Trump team spokesman,noted on Xthat Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warned Trump against pardoning his children in 2020 before leaving office andlikened pre-emptive pardonsto an abuse of power. Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, lambasted the outgoing president for the move. Comer hadled an investigationinto the Biden family and international business endeavors. “President Biden’s preemptive pardons for the Biden Crime Family serve as a confession of their corruption as they sold out the American people to enrich themselves,\" Comer said in a statement. \"Our investigation revealed that at least ten members of the Biden Crime Family and their associates raked in over $30 million by selling Joe Biden’s influence to corrupt foreign entities and individuals in China, Russia, Ukraine, Romania, and Kazakhstan.\" Trump told a reporter in between inaugural events at the Capitol that it was \"unfortunate\" that Biden issued the pardons. Biden had alreadypardoned his son,Hunter, of federal gun and tax charges after he and his White House repeatedly said he would not take such an action. That move did not sit well with  many Democrats. Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.,recently told USA Todaythat Biden\\'s pardon of Hunter was a “very ill-considered decision.” On Monday, Biden also pardoned Schiff, who has been targeted by Trump and his allies after serving on the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack at the U.S. Capitol.

       "   'content': '   Manage your account  In the final minutes of his presidency, Joe Biden pre-emptively pardoned several family members, including his brothers James and Frank Biden, and sister Valerie Biden Owens. Biden said the pardons were intended to shield his family from politically motivated attacks and should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment of any wrongdoing. The eleventh-hour move follows another set of pardons issued to Covid response chief Anthony Fauci and members of the House 6 January riot investigation to prevent what he called \"unjustified... politically motivated prosecutions\". The outgoing president said: \"Our nation owes these public servants a debt of gratitude for their tireless commitment.\" Donald Trump regularly clashed with Dr Fauci during the pandemic and has suggested he would take action against those who tried to hold him accountable for the 6 January Capitol riot and other \"enemies from within\". For years, Trump has levelled unproven accusations of corruption at both Biden and his family. In 2023, House Republicans launched a nearly yearlong investigation into the Bidens, examining their business dealings abroad, but found no criminal wrongdoing. \"My family has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats, motivated solely by a desire to hurt me,\" Biden said in a statement released as Trump arrived at the Capitol rotunda for his inauguration. \"Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe these attacks will end.\" In addition to his siblings, Biden issued pardons for his sister-in-law Sara Jones Biden and his brother-in-law John Owens. The outgoing president had previously issued a pardon for his son, Hunter Biden, who was facing sentencing for two criminal cases.

As he prepared to leave the White House, Biden also commuted the life sentence of indigenous activist Leonard Peltier, who was serving a life sentence for the 1975 murder of two FBI agents. Peltier will transition to house arrest, Biden said in a statement. On Monday morning, a Trump spokesperson has called Biden\\'s pre-emptive pardons \"the greatest attack on America\\'s justice system in history\". \"With the stroke of a pen, he (Biden) unilaterally shielded a group of political cronies from the scales of justice,\" Taylor Budowich, Trump\\'s incoming deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel said in a post on X. \"This is yet another dangerous and unreversible erosion of American norms.\" Biden also issued a pre-emptive pardon to Mark Milley, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who last year described Trump as \"fascist to the core\". Biden\\'s statement said that the pardons should \"not be mistaken as an acknowledgment\" that any of those covered \"engaged in any wrongdoing\". Democrats had warned the outgoing president against such action. Adam Schiff, a Senator for California, said Biden could set a \"precedent\" for \"each president hereafter on their way out the door giving out a broad category of pardons\". What are presidential pardons? Dr Fauci told US media that he \"truly appreciated\" Biden for taking action, adding that the possibility of prosecution had created \"immeasurable and intolerable distress\" on his family. \"Let me be perfectly clear, I have committed no crime and there are no possible grounds for any allegation or threat of criminal investigation or prosecution of me,\" he added. Gen Milley, 66, thanked Biden in a statement and stated that he did not wish to spend the rest of his life \"fighting those who unjustly might seek retribution for perceived slights\". \"I do not want to put my family, my friends, and those with whom I served through the resulting distraction, expense, and anxiety,\" he said. Biden\\'s pardons cover all members of the House Select Committee that investigated the 6 January riot, as well as their staff and the officers who testified. The committee was led by Democrat Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who later campaigned with Trump\\'s opponent, Vice-President Kamala Harris. Trump in December backed a call for the FBI to investigate Cheney over her role in leading Congress\\'s probe. But the pardons do not shield the officials from congressional investigations. The recipients could be subject to probes from a Republican-led Congress that require them to testify and provide other materials. Former US Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn said he was \"eternally grateful\" to Biden \"not just for this pre-emptive pardon, but for his leadership and service to this nation\". \"Unfortunately, the political climate we are in now has made the need for [a pardon] somewhat of a reality,\" he said. \"I, like all other public servants, was just doing my job and upholding my oath.\" Trump is set to pardon some of those convicted of crimes related to the riot. \"You\\'re going to see something tomorrow,\" Trump said on Sunday, in reference to the 6 January rioters. \"I think you\\'ll be very, very happy.\" On the campaign trail, Trump railed against \"enemies from within\", and has endorsed several figures who have vowed retribution against his foes to join his cabinet. However, his choice for attorney general, Pam Bondi, said during her confirmation hearing last week thatthere would never be an enemies listand that she would not use the justice department to target anyone based on their politics. Donald Trump was sworn in Monday as the 47th president of the United States in one of the most remarkable political comebacks in U.S. history. “If you’re looking for me to sugarcoat the reality we’re facing, I can’t do that,” Rep. Jasmine Crockett tells Harper’s Bazaar. Welcome to the next four years. Donald Trump was sworn into office on Monday for a second term in the White House, and international figures across the globe are sharing their reactions to the 47th president\\'s inauguration.  Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Trump on his return to office, specifically his \"desire to restore direct contacts with Russia, which were interrupted through no fault of our own by the outgoing administration.\"  \"We also hear his statements about the need to do everything to prevent a third World War,\" Putin said during a meeting with members of the Russian Security Council.

For the occasion, he is ditching his navy and crimson \"Trump Force One\" he often flies in favor of a government plane Biden sent to Florida. Donald Trump was supported by family for his Jan. 20 Inauguration as 47th President, including daughter Tiffany Trump, who is pregnant with her and husband Michael Boulos’ first baby. Donald Trump\\'s campaign team attempted to troll the outgoing president on social media. First Lady Melania Trump chose a classic navy blue and ivory ensemble for her husband President Donald Trump, who was worn in as the 47th President at the 2025 Presidential Inauguration. Rep. Byron Donalds had an odd way of describing the president-elect. Melania, 54, has hit out at Barack and Michelle Obama, claiming they made it \"challenging\" for her and Donald to move to the White House. Bill and Hillary Clinton were less than impressed by Donald Trump’s inaugural speech, a fact which they made clear with subtle snark. The address that followed Trump’s swearing-in on Monday was tinged with vindication. The new president slammed the previous administration, declared that God saved him from an assassin’s bullet, and vowed to usher in a new “golden age” in America. Asked what his reaction to the speech was, former President Clinton told CNN, “I think you can figure it out for yours \"My goodness gracious,\" Harry Enten said of one particular polling detail on the outgoing president. Though Barack Obama was in attendance for the inauguration, his wife Michelle was noticeably absent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump will immediately issue executive orders that slash diversity, equity and inclusion programs and proclaim the U.S. government will only recognize two sexes - male and female - that cannot be changed, an incoming White House official said on Monday.  The official, speaking just hours before Trump was sworn in as the 47th president, added that more actions on DEI programs were expected \"very soon.\"  \"This week, I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life,\" Trump said in his inaugural address. WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President-elect Donald Trump is poised to seize greater control of the federal government than any modern president before him when he takes office on Monday, charging ahead with plans to dismantle what he and his allies call the \"deep state,\" according to two sources familiar with transition discussions.  The effort could get underway as early as Trump\\'s first day as president, according to one of the sources, with an executive order aimed at stripping job protections from an estimated 50,000 career federal employees, allowing their replacement by handpicked loyalist appointees.  The Trump administration will also push to fill the thousands of political appointments across government as soon as possible, another source told Reuters.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Sunday he would release classified documents in the coming days related to the assassinations of U.S. President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.  Trump, who returns to the White House on Monday, promised on the campaign trail to release classified intelligence and law enforcement files on the 1963 assassination of JFK, as America\\'s 35th president is widely known.

She was 67. Richards died Monday at home “surrounded by family and her ever-loyal dog, Ollie,” her family said in a statement. “Our hearts are broken today but no words can do justice to the joy she brought to our lives,” the family said. Richards, the daughter of the late Texas Gov. Ann Richards, was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, in 2023, five years aftershe left Planned Parenthood. Though Planned Parenthood also provides birth control, cancer screenings and testing for sexually transmitted diseases at clinics nationwide, its status as the nation’s leading abortion provider has long made it a lightning rod for debate. Richards played a prominent role in pushing back against criticism during her tenure as president and beyond. In 2015, she spent hoursanswering hostile questionsfrom Republican U.S. House members who later created an investigative panel to probe Planned Parenthood’s abortion and fetal-tissue policies. In 2021,she warnedthat the U.S. Supreme Court’s inaction on Texas’ restrictive abortion law could signal the end of judicial checks and balances on the issue. And after the courtoverturned Roe v. Wadein 2022, she continued to speak out. “One day, our children and grandchildren may ask us, ‘When it was all on the line, what did you do?’” she said at the Democratic National Convention in August. “The only acceptable answer is, ‘Everything we could.’” President Joe Biden, who awarded Richards the Presidential Medal of Freedom in November, on Monday called her a “leader of utmost character.” “Cecile fearlessly led us forward to be the America we say we are,” he said in a statement. “Carrying her mom’s torch for justice, she championed some of our Nation’s most important civil rights causes. She fought for the dignity of workers, defended and advanced women’s reproductive rights and equality, and mobilized our fellow Americans to exercise their power to vote.” Alexis McGill Johnson, current president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, called Richards an “indomitable force.” “As we continue to navigate uncharted territory, we will be able to meet the challenges we face in large part because of the movement Cecile built over decades,” she said. “I know, without a doubt, that Cecile would tell us the best way to honor her memory is to suit up — preferably in pink — link arms, and fight like hell for Planned Parenthood patients across the country.” In her Democratic convention speech, Richards described the joy of becoming a grandmother in 2023 and quoted her mother when referring to Kamala Harris\\' presidential campaign as a “celebration of women.” “As my mother, Gov. Ann Richards, would say, ‘I hear America singing,\\'\" she said. “When women are free to make their own decisions about their lives and to follow our dreams, we are unstoppable.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events',\n",

Our hearts are broken today but no words can do justice to the joy she brought to our lives,\" read a statement attributed to Richards\\' husband, Kirk Adams, and their three children, which CBS News obtained. \"We are grateful to the doctors and health care workers who provided her excellent care and the friends, family, and well-wishers who have been by her side during this challenging time.\" The family asked those looking to honor Richards\\' life and legacy to recall a sentiment that they said she repeated often over the last year. \"It\\'s not hard to imagine future generations one day asking: \\'When there was so much at stake for our country, what did you do?\\' The only acceptable answer is: \\'Everything we could,\\'\" the statement quoted her as saying. A longstanding champion of women\\'s rights, Texas-born Richards will be remembered as one of the United States\\' most prominent advocates forabortion accessin recent decades, who steered Planned Parenthood from 2006 to 2018. She repeatedly defended the organization and its mission against mounting attacks from political opponents, including President-elect Donald Trump, whose pledge to overturn the landmark abortion rights decision Roe v. Wade was central to his first presidential campaign. Richards was diagnosed in 2023 with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. She initially shared the news in an interview with The Cut, published last January. \"The last six months have been wild — but thanks to incredible health care providers and the support of family and friends, I\\'m doing really well,\" Richards wrote in a social media post at the time. \"I\\'ve felt lucky all my life, and I feel lucky now: to be here, doing this work, alongside all of you.\" After stepping down as president of Planned Parenthood,Richards went onto found a new political action group, calledSupermajority, alongside Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza and National Domestic Workers Alliance director Ai-jen Poo. The group focuses on encouraging women to become politically active, with the aim of empowering them as a voting bloc.

As we continue to navigate uncharted territory, we will be able to meet the challenges we face in large part because of the movement Cecile built over decades,\" Johnson said. \"I know, without a doubt, that Cecile would tell us the best way to honor her memory is to suit up — preferably in pink — link arms, and fight like hell for Planned Parenthood patients across the country.\" Richards\\' work earned her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in November, adding to the accolades she received throughout her career. TIME magazine named her among the 100 most influential people in the world in 2012. President Biden said in a statement that he and first lady Jill Biden were \"deeply saddened\" by Richards\\' death, and described her as \"a leader of utmost character\" who followed in the footsteps of her mother, former Texas Gov. Ann Richards, also a political activist. \"Cecile fearlessly led us forward to be the America we say we are,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement. \"Carrying her mom\\'s torch for justice, she championed some of our Nation\\'s most important civil rights causes.

She fought tirelessly on behalf of all women, and today millions across the nation benefit from her work,” she said. “She would want us to honor her by rededicating ourselves to the fight for fundamental freedoms. Let us roll up our sleeves and make her proud.” Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa remembered Richards as a “trailblazer, a force for good, and a voice for the voiceless.” “Cecile was a true Texas giant whose work will continue to guide us as we push forward in the fight for justice, equality and restoring reproductive freedom,” Hinojosa said in astatement. “Cecile Richards was a dear friend & invaluable partner in so many fights, from making sure the ACA covered birth control to keeping Planned Parenthood’s doors open no matter what,”Sen.

       "   'content': 'Sarah McCammon In this file photo, then-Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards speaks during a rally opposing repeal of the Affordable Care Act outside of the Capitol Building on July 27, 2017 in Washington, DC.Zach Gibson/Getty Imageshide caption Cecile Richards, a prominent advocate for women\\'s rights and other progressive causes, died Monday. In a statement, her family confirmed her death, saying she passed away at home, \"surrounded by family and her ever-loyal dog, Ollie.\" \"Our hearts are broken today but no words can do justice to the joy she brought to our lives,\" the statement said. Richards was best known for her work leading Planned Parenthood through a particularly challenging time which included threats to its funding and the first election of Donald Trump to the presidency. During more than a decade at the helm of Planned Parenthood, Richards was oftencalled upon to defendthe reproductive health organization against attacks from political opponents.She and her movement faced mounting challenges after Trump, who ran for President in 2016 on a promise to overturn the landmark abortion rights decisionRoe v. Wade, was first elected. At theWomen\\'s Marchin Washington the day after Trump\\'s inauguration in 2017, Richards addressed thousands of marchers and promised to fight his policies. \"Today we\\'re here to deliver a message: we\\'re not gonna take this lying down, and we will not go back,\" Richards told the crowd. The next year,Richards announcedshe was leaving Planned Parenthood. After leaving the organization, Richards focused her efforts on leading Supermajority, a group she\\'d co-founded to mobilize female voters. In the years to come, the Trump administration would take steps designed to reduce access to abortion, including cutting off funds for groups that make abortion referrals, like Planned Parenthood, through anoverhaul of the Title Xfamily planning program. Over the course of his first term, Trump named three conservative justices to the Supreme Court, who, in June of 2022, would ultimately vote to overturn decades of abortion-rights precedent. Despite setbacks for the abortion rights movement and a diagnosis of brain cancer, Richards embodied an \"indefatigable\" determination, says former Texas State Sen. Wendy Davis. \"Her belief [was] you can\\'t give up before you even start, and that it\\'s always worth a fight,\" Davis said. Davis worked closely with Richards during ahigh-profile battleto defeat an anti-abortion bill in Texas in 2013. Now a senior advisor to Planned Parenthood Texas Votes, the group\\'s political arm in Texas, Davis says Richards still inspires her to keep fighting. \"You want to give in to the weariness and give in to just giving up,\" Davis said. \"When I\\'m tempted to feel that way, I think about Cecile, and I know a lot of people do.\" Richards herself drew inspiration from thelegacy of her mother, the late Texas Gov. Ann Richards, who was known for her sharp wit and down-to-earth demeanor. Duringa hearingbefore the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in 2015, a male lawmaker asked her if she expected the committee \"to be easier on you because you\\'re a woman?\" \"Absolutely not,\" Richards responded. \"That\\'s not how my mama raised me.\" The hearing stemmed from the release ofsecretly-recorded videosby the Center for Medical Progress, an anti-abortion group that accused Planned Parenthood of selling fetal body parts. Planned Parenthood said the stingvideos were editedto be deliberately misleading. Dr. Colleen McNicholas, Chief Medical Officer at Planned Parenthood Great Rivers in the St. Louis area, knew Richards for more than a decade through their advocacy for abortion rights. \"I think she really changed the way that the movement engaged publicly; she was a very visible and bold presence,\" McNicholas says. \"She wasn\\'t afraid to take questions, to say the word \\'abortion.\\'\" Washington Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat with a long history of advocacy for reproductive rights, credits Richards with aninstrumental rolein making sure the Affordable Care Act, which passed under President Barack Obama, included contraceptive coverage. Murray says despite the setbacks the movement has faced in recent years, she sees Richards as an example of continuing to fight. \"I would take what Cecile has done in her lifetime and use it as a charge to all of us now: you move forward, you fight for what you believe in, you have the courage to stand up and say what is right,\" Murray says. \"You take those setbacks, learn from them, and move forward, and she\\'s always done that.\" In an Instagram post in January 2024, months after her cancer diagnosis, Richards described going through a whirlwind of treatments, time with family, and focusing on what was most important — including her continued activism. \"After all,\" Richards wrote, \"as my mother used to say: \\'Why should your life be just about you?\\'\" As her health continued to decline,Richards addressedthe 2024 Democratic National Convention. Shespoke of the joyof recently becoming a grandmother, and the challenges many women have faced since the overturning ofRoe v. Wade. \"One day, our children and grandchildren may ask us, \\'When it was all on the line, what did you do?\\' And the only acceptable answer is, everything we could,\" Richards said. In November 2024, President Joe Biden honored Cecile Richards with the Presidential Medal of Freedom during a private ceremony at the White House. In a statement, Biden praised Richards for her \"absolute courage and conviction\" and \"an inspiring legacy that endures in her incredible family, the countless lives she has made better, and a Nation seeking the light of equality, justice, and freedom.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor',\n",

       "   'content': 'Texas-born activist who spent lifetime advocating for abortion rights died after a battle with brain cancer Cecile Richards, the former president ofPlanned Parenthoodwho helped turn the reproductive healthcare giant into a formidable political organization and make support for abortion rights a virtual requirement forDemocraticcandidates, died on Monday after a battle with brain cancer. She was 67. “This morning our beloved Cecile passed away at home, surrounded by her family and her ever-loyal dog, Ollie,”Richards’ family wrote in a statement. “Our hearts are broken today but no words can do justice to the joy she brought to our lives.” Over the course of her career, Richards became one of the biggest faces ofUS abortion rights, if not one of the most important American activists of the 21st century. Under her watch,Planned Parenthoodbecame a mainstay in Democratic politics, battled numerous congressional attempts to defund the organization, and tried to dam a torrent of state-level efforts to restrict abortion access. Her mother, the former Texas governor Ann Richards, was a political legend, but Richards herself became a household name in 2015, after anti-abortion activists released secret recordings of Planned Parenthood workers purportedly discussing the sale of fetal tissue. The recordings – which Planned Parenthood said were doctored – spurred multiple congressional and state investigations that could not substantiate their contents, and led US House Republicans to grill Richards in an hours-long, highly publicized hearing. After stepping down from Planned Parenthood in 2018, Richards went on to found Supermajority, an organization dedicated to championing women’s leadership. After the US supreme court overturnedRoe v Wadein 2022 – in a case involving the kind of state-level abortion restrictions that Richards tried to defeat – Richards started Charley, a bot to help abortion seekers get accurate information about the procedure, and Abortion in America, a campaign to publicize stories of post-Roe abortions. In late 2024, Joe Biden awarded Richards the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the US. “One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned as a lifelong organizer is that there are no permanent wins and no permanent losses. We have to fight for every inch of progress, and we can’t take anything for granted,” Richards wrote on Instagram after receiving the honor. “That’s especially true in challenging moments like the one we find ourselves in now. But what a joy and a privilege it is to be part of the long struggle to make our country a fairer and more hopeful place.” Richards was born on 15 July 1957, in Waco, Texas, and was primarily raised in Dallas and Austin. Her political involvement began early in life, as her parents were ardent progressives. “They were into politics like other couples were into bowling,” Richards toldNPRin 2014. “Every movement that came through town, whether it was the farm workers, the labor movement, the women’s movement, they were into and so were all their friends.” After graduating from Brown University, Richards started working as a labor organizer in Louisiana, where she met her husband, Kirk Adams, who went on to hold leadership positions at the powerful Service Employees International Union. The couple had three children together. Ahead of the 1990 election, the family moved back to Texas to help Ann Richards run for governor. Known for her silvery, sky-high hair and acerbic wit – during her address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, Richards famously declared that Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did, “just backwards and in high heels” – Richards eked out a narrow victory, thanks to a coalition of female voters and voters of color. She then lost her 1994 re-election campaign (to future US president George W Bush), but remained Cecile Richards’ political north star for the rest of Cecile’s life. A chapter of Cecile Richards’ best-selling 2018 memoir, Make Trouble, is titled: “What Would Ann Richards Do?” After Ann Richards’ gubernatorial loss, Cecile attended a 1995 Texas state board of education meeting, where she watched rightwing activists crusade against providing students with information about sex education and LGBTQ+ rights. Struck by the religious right’s rising power, Richards founded Texas Freedom Network, one of the most prominent progressive advocacy organizations in the Lone Star State. Richards later moved to Washington DC, where she served as Nancy Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff before helping to found and lead the voting rights coalition America Votes. The Planned Parenthood Federation of America hired Richards as president in 2006. Two years later, the non-profit endorsed Barack Obama for president. It was only the second time in the group’s 85-year history that it had endorsed a candidate for president, but it heralded Planned Parenthood’s increased commitment to electoral politics – a hallmark of Richards’ time at its helm. By greatly expanding Planned Parenthood’s fundraising and state-level organizing, especially in the face of repeated Republican efforts to defund it, Richards made it into an organization that could corral votes as well as make or break political candidates. After 2010, when Democrats’ inter-party arguing over abortion coverage nearly defeated the Affordable Care Act, Planned Parenthood worked to turn support for abortion rights into a key plank in the Democratic party platform. Today, there is just one anti-abortion Democrat in Congress. After beingdiagnosed with brain cancer in 2023, Richards continued to work on leftwing causes. She co-chaired American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic network that includes a formidable Super Pac, and spoke at the 2024 Democratic National Convention in support of Kamala Harris.Alongside Kate Cox, a Texan woman who sued after being denied a medically necessary abortion, Richards cast Texas’s ceremonial votes in support of Harris. In their statement, Richards’ family said that those who wished to honor Richards’ memory should keep in mind something she frequently said over the last year of her life: “It’s hard not to imagine future generations one day asking: ‘When there was so much at stake for our country, what did you do?’ The only acceptable answer is: ‘Everything we could.’”',\n",

Richards was 67. \"This morning our beloved Cecile passed away at home, surrounded by her family and her ever-loyal dog, Ollie. Our hearts are broken today but no words can do justice to the joy she brought to our lives,\" read a statement attributed to Richards\\' husband, Kirk Adams, and their three children, which CBS News obtained. \"We are grateful to the doctors and health care workers who provided her excellent care and the friends, family, and well-wishers who have been by her side during this challenging time.\" The family asked those looking to honor Richards\\' life and legacy to recall a sentiment that they said she repeated often over the last year. \"It\\'s not hard to imagine future generations one day asking: \\'When there was so much at stake for our country, what did you do?\\' The only acceptable answer is: \\'Everything we could,\\'\" the statement quoted her as saying. A longstanding champion of women\\'s rights, Texas-born Richards will be remembered as one of the United States\\' most prominent advocates forabortion accessin recent decades, who steered Planned Parenthood from 2006 to 2018. She repeatedly defended the organization and its mission against mounting attacks from political opponents, including President-elect Donald Trump, whose pledge to overturn the landmark abortion rights decision Roe v. Wade was central to his first presidential campaign. Richards was diagnosed in 2023 with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. She initially shared the news in an interview with The Cut, published last January. \"The last six months have been wild — but thanks to incredible health care providers and the support of family and friends, I\\'m doing really well,\" Richards wrote in a social media post at the time. \"I\\'ve felt lucky all my life, and I feel lucky now: to be here, doing this work, alongside all of you.\" After stepping down as president of Planned Parenthood,Richards went onto found a new political action group, calledSupermajority, alongside Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza and National Domestic Workers Alliance director Ai-jen Poo. The group focuses on encouraging women to become politically active, with the aim of empowering them as a voting bloc. Alexis McGill Johnson, Planned Parenthood\\'s current president and CEO, called Richards \"an indomitable force\" and praised her for lifting the organization \"to new heights\" during her tenure in another statement Monday. \"We are heartbroken to lose a giant in the fight for reproductive freedom. As we continue to navigate uncharted territory, we will be able to meet the challenges we face in large part because of the movement Cecile built over decades,\" Johnson said. \"I know, without a doubt, that Cecile would tell us the best way to honor her memory is to suit up — preferably in pink — link arms, and fight like hell for Planned Parenthood patients across the country.\" Richards\\' work earned her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in November, adding to the accolades she received throughout her career. TIME magazine named her among the 100 most influential people in the world in 2012. President Biden said in a statement that he and first lady Jill Biden were \"deeply saddened\" by Richards\\' death, and described her as \"a leader of utmost character\" who followed in the footsteps of her mother, former Texas Gov. Ann Richards, also a political activist. \"Cecile fearlessly led us forward to be the America we say we are,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement. \"Carrying her mom\\'s torch for justice, she championed some of our Nation\\'s most important civil rights causes. She fought for the dignity of workers, defended and advanced women\\'s reproductive rights and equality, and mobilized our fellow Americans to exercise their power to vote.

The official, speaking just hours before Trump was sworn in as the 47th president, added that more actions on DEI programs were expected \"very soon.\"  \"This week, I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life,\" Trump said in his inaugural address. WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President-elect Donald Trump is poised to seize greater control of the federal government than any modern president before him when he takes office on Monday, charging ahead with plans to dismantle what he and his allies call the \"deep state,\" according to two sources familiar with transition discussions.  The effort could get underway as early as Trump\\'s first day as president, according to one of the sources, with an executive order aimed at stripping job protections from an estimated 50,000 career federal employees, allowing their replacement by handpicked loyalist appointees.

       "   'content': 'ByTessa Stuart Cecile Richards, the organizer and activist who transformedPlanned Parenthoodinto a political powerhouse, died on Monday at age 67. A year ago, Richards announced that she had been diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive and incurable form of brain cancer. Richards “passed away at home, surrounded by her family and her ever-loyal dog, Ollie,” her husband Kirk, daughters Lily and Hannah, and son Daniel, said in a joint statement. “If you’d like to celebrate Cecile today, we invite you to put on some New Orleans jazz, gather with friends and family over a good meal, and remember something she said a lot over the last year: ‘It’s not hard to imagine future generations one day asking: “When there was so much at stake for our country, what did you do?” The only acceptable answer is: everything we could.’” Richards used the line in aneditorialshe wrote forRolling Stoneon the eve of the election, urging Americans to support Kamala Harris. Richards was the daughter of Texas Gov. Ann Richards (D). A graduate of Brown University, she worked in labor movement, organizing garment workers in Texas and hotel workers in New Orleans, before moving to Washington D.C., where she served as deputy chief of staff to Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) before departing in 2004 to lead the progressive coalition America Votes. Two years later, she joined Planned Parenthood as president. She led the organization for 12 years, through multiple Republican campaigns seeking to defund the organization, and a controversy stirred by right-wing activists who falsely claimed Planned Parenthood sold fetal tissue for profit. Richards left the organization in 2016, shortly after the election ofDonald Trump. Trump would go on to appoint three Supreme Court justices. That newly-conservative majority, of course, went on to strike downRoe v. Wade, eliminating the federal right to abortion.In a moment, years of work Richards spent working to expand abortion access was undone.Editor’s picksThe 100 Best TV Episodes of All TimeThe 250 Greatest Guitarists of All TimeThe 500 Greatest Albums of All TimeThe 200 Greatest Singers of All Time “My feeling is not a personal one: It’s much more just horror that this is the state of the United States at this point,” Richards said, speaking toRolling Stonein 2022. “It’s not only abortion — it’s the thought of the country being ruled by a minority, and moving more into this completely totalitarian regime where it doesn’t matter what the majority thinks, whether it’s on gun reform, the right to make your own decisions about pregnancy, climate. It’s just horrifying that we are living in a non-democratic country right now.” In recognition of her work with Planned Parenthood, President Joe Biden awarded Richards the Medal of Freedom, America’s highest civilian honor, in November. She is the first person to be honored for their work to advance abortion access. On Monday, remembrances of Richards poured in from politicians and activists. Harris called her “a fighter and a force to be reckoned with” who “led with heart, fearlessness, and courage on the frontlines of the fight for women’s rights and the dignity of every woman to make decisions about their own body.” Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign remembered Richards as “a giant in the fight for freedom — an unwavering advocate for reproductive, workers’ and civil rights who never stopped fighting for a stronger, more inclusive country.” And Mini Timmaraju, the president of Reproductive Freedom For All, called her “a true hero, a fighter for our freedoms, and… a dear friend.” In her own statement, Alexis McGill Johnson, the current president of Planned Parenthood, called Richards an “indomitable force” who “brought Planned Parenthood Federation of America to new heights.” “We are heartbroken to lose a giant in the fight for reproductive freedom,” \\xa0McGill Johnson added. “As we continue to navigate uncharted territory, we will be able to meet the challenges we face in large part because of the movement Cecile built over decades.

Richards was diagnosed with glioblastoma, a terminal brain cancer, in 2023. She died at home, \"surrounded by family and her ever-loyal dog, Ollie,\" Richards’ family said in a statement. Her passing came hours before Donald Trump was inaugurated as president. Trump appointed three Supreme Court justices who provided a conservative majority tooverturn Roe v. Wadein 2022, ending federal protections for abortion rights throughout the U.S. Related Richards was perhaps best known forleading Planned Parenthood; from 2006 to 2018, she was the organization’s president,the longest amount of timeany individual led the organization. Her tenure started during the second administration of President George W. Bush and ended during Trump’s first administration. As the national fight over abortion access intensified in the mid 2010s, Richards often served as the public face for abortion rights. During her time at the organization, Richardsfought off attackson abortion funding from Republican-led state legislatures; in 2022, she described the previous 20 years as “a turning point in the fight for access to abortion” inan essayfor The New York Times. She was the daughter of former Texas Gov. Ann Richards, a Democrat who served from 1991 to 1995 and died in 2006. In 2013, Cecile Richards joined protesters in the state Capitol building “yelling at the top of their lungs” to try to block a restrictive abortion bill that eventually passed. Richards left her post at Planned Parenthood in 2018 and spent her remaining years working to improve information and access around reproductive care. In November, former President Joe Bidenpresented Richardswith the Medal of Freedom. In a private ceremony, Biden said that Richards had “led some of our nation’s most important civil rights causes — to lift up the dignity of workers, defend and advance women’s reproductive rights and equality, and mobilize Americans to exercise their power to vote.” Last summer, New York Magazinespoke with Richardsabout her continued fight for abortion access amid her own health battle. At the time, she’d recently launchedAbortion in America, a website where individuals who have sought abortion care after Roe’s overturning can share their stories. She also worked to launch Charley, an AI chatbot that provides information on where people can access abortions. “So many people I’ve worked with and organized, nursing-home workers and hotel workers and janitors, they didn’t have any options,” Richards told the magazine. “But I have been one of the really privileged few that could do what I thought needed doing. And so whatever comes next, I have that.” Read more about this topic Copyright © 2025 Salon.com, LLC. Reproduction of material from any Salon pages without written permission is strictly prohibited.

Melania Trumparrived at the ceremony on Monday wearing anoutfit by American designer Adam Lippes, according to fashion website WWD — but what everyone is talking about is the incoming first lady's hat, the work of American designer Eric Javits. The wide-rimmed hat, a dark navy with a white ribbon, partially shields Trump's face, and immediately evoked a sharp reaction. Some users on X admired the look: Others, however, harkened it to fictional characters Zorro, a masked vigilante, and Carmen Sandiego, a criminal mastermind: There were also comparisons to theBabadook, the titular horror character of Jennifer Kent's 2014 film(combined with the Quaker Oat man...) Melania looks like a combination of the Babadook and the Quaker Oats man[image or embed] Given that the hat obscured Trump's face, there was also speculation that the sartorial choice would fuelconspiracy theories about a \"fake\" Melania: As today goes on, the conversation is sure to steer away from fashion and towards whatever executive orders Donald Trump will sign on day one of his second term as president.

       "      <td>One day before hisinauguration, president-elect Donald Trump pledged to issue aday one executive orderintended to save TikTok, despite being a main proponent of a ban during his first term. Posting to Truth Social on Jan. 19, Trump wrote that he was looking to “extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect” and foster a \"deal to protect our national security,\" suggesting that he intends to broker a joint venture that would result in an American company taking 50 percent ownership. He called on companies to \"not let TikTok go dark\"and said he could \"confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.\" TikTok quickly responded, saying it was workingtoreinstate servicefollowing Trump's statements. The app was up and running for existing users shortly after, although it still remains off U.S. app stores. \"We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive,\"wrotethe platformon their official policy account on X. Despite Trump only promising to work on saving the app, and not yet bestowed with executive power, a new pop-up notification on the platform reads: Welcome back!Thanks for your patience and support. As a result of President Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.!You can continue to create, share, and discover all the things you love on TikTok. In a reversal from hisprevious stance and executive ordersduring his first presidential term, Trump has turned in favor of the China-owned company over the last year. Last month, the president-elect sent an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court arguing he isuniquely positioned to save TikTokand protect the country's national security objectives, asking the court to grant a stay on the ban. The court laterupheld the ban. Trump and tech's biggest names have been courting each other's favor for months, especially following Trump's campaign victory. On Jan. 17, TikTok CEO Shou Chewposted a public messageto users in which he thanked Trump for his efforts to reinstate the app. \"This is a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship,\" said Chew. \"We are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform — one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process.\" Not long after the app went dark, TikTok altered an in-app pop up message alerting users to the ban. The original message read: We regret that a U.S. law banning TikTok will take effect on January 19 and force us to make our services temporarily unavailable.We're working to restore our service in the U.S. as soon as possible, and we appreciate your support. Please stay tuned. The revised notification read: A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now.We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned! The pop-up was then removed. It's not just TikTok, either. Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Tesla/ X owner Elon Musk, who is set toscore an advisory positionunder the new administration, have also publicly praised Trump and his policy positions, particularly surrounding hiscontroversial stances on content moderationand free speech. Meta recently overhauled itsmoderationandDEIpolicies in the name of a more \"free speech\" supportive platform, abolishing its diversity mandates and loosening its hate speech policies to includepreviously bannedforms of content. And OpenAI's Sam Altman hasdefended his decisionto donate millions in personal contributions to Trump's inaugural fund, in response to a letter from U.S. Senators hinting at possible corruption. Many of Big Tech's inner circle, including Chew, areexpected to appearat the inaugural swearing-in ceremony on Monday.

The Trumps, Republicans, and Trump’s inner circle turned out for private dinners and fireworks in a show of strength. Their sartorial choices said as much. As we saw throughout Trump’s previous presidential tenure, clothing and fashion played a significant part in the Trumpian narrative. Where Melania Trump’schoice of dresscould propel a designer into the discourse and subtle and not-so-hidden messages were communicated through clothing.

With the Bidens exiting the White House,Dr. Biden’s choiceof traditional American designers comes to mind: American-in-Paris Daniel Roseberry forSchiaparelli, Tom Ford, Ralph Lauren, and even Jackie Kennedy’s go-to Oscar de la Renta.Michelle Obama’s allegiance to both emerging and under-appreciated designers too: such as Jason Wu andIsabel Toledo. Predictions abound for who will dress the incoming second-time first lady—who was fond of Louboutin, Dior, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, and Ralph Lauren the first time around—and what the next fuschia pussybow blouse or “I Really Don’t Care—Do U?” moments will be. This weekend’s pre-inauguration events offer clues for what to expect. Vice President-elect JD Vance and his wife Usha Vance hosted the vice presidential dinner at the National Gallery of Art on January 18 in Washington, DC. For the black tie event, Usha wore a custom noir velvet gown with asymmetric floral accents and a sweetheart neckline by Oscar de la Renta. Vance wore a classic tuxedo. The incoming vice president'sown clothing choiceshave been a discussion point for the last few weeks, as he seems to be mirroring Trump’s most outlandish looks, swapping his Silicon Valley-stuck windbreakers, shrunken, single-breasted suits, and chinos for Republican red ties (a Trump signature), and wider-tailored suits. For Saturday’s event, he gave his beard a trim: Something of note, given it’s been more than a century since a sitting president or vice president has had such prominent facial hair. The incoming Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was also present and wore a navy and black lapel jacket, a white tuxedo shirt with black piping, accessorized with a bow tie and white pocket scarf. His wife, the actor Cheryl Hines, wore an off-the-shoulder black dress with feather detailing. Tiffany Trump attended with husband Michael Boulos; she wore a black sweetheart neckline dress. Eric Trump with his wife Lara were also present. On Friday, Donald Trump Jr. and his partner Bettina Anderson attended the Crypto Ball in Washington D.C., sporting a patriotic look. He wore a tuxedo and bowtie, with American flag cufflinks and dress shirt buttons that spelled out ‘MAGA’. Trump and Melania began their celebrations at his golf club in Sterling, Virginia, just outside of Washington, with a fireworks showcase. The Trump family, also including Ivanka and Jared Kushner, were in attendance. Melania wore a gray Dior coat and a Dolce &amp; Gabbana pantsuit, while Bettina and Tiffany wore white, buttoned-up coats. Ivanka wore a black wool coat and dress. The Trump clan and his chosen incoming cabinet appeared for a wreath laying by Trump and J.D. Vance at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia on January 19. Melania went monochrome and an almost military-style: a black, buttoned Dior cape coat with elbow-length black leather gloves and knee-high Christian Louboutin boots. Usha was the opposite, in a white, a-line wool coat and dress from Sergio Hudson, with brown leather gloves and matching brown knee-high leather boots. Ivanka wore a beige, floral applique Oscar de la Renta coat with brown leather gloves, and Tiffany wore a grey, princess-style belted coat with silver buttons. Also on the eve of the inauguration ceremony, a candlelit dinner was held at at the National Building Museum in Washington D.C.. Melania wore a Saint Laurent tuxedo cape, with a white Dolce &amp; Gabbana shirt, a Ralph Lauren belt, Carolina Herrera sequin skirt, and Manolo Blahnik pumps to watch her husband deliver his speech. Ivanka wore a custom off-shoulder crystal and pearl floral-embroidered empire waist gown with a silver stole by Oscar de la Renta. Usha Vance wore a deep purple, one-shoulder gown by Indian couturier Gaurav Gupta. Other notable guests included SpaceX and Tesla’s Elon Musk, Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos and his partnerLauren Sánchez. Sánchez wore a black Dolce &amp; Gabbana dress with a sweetheart neckline and crystal corset. As the events continue to unfold, following the sartorial choices of the first family and their inner circle through uncertain and turbulent times will prove interesting.

John Yang speaks with Anshel Pfeffer, Israel correspondent for The Economist, for the latest. Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. John Yang: Good evening. I'm John Yang. Just 12 hours before the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel is to go into effect, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it would not go forward until Hamas made good on its agreement to provide a list of the hostages they're going to release. Netanyahu also said that Israel could resume fighting if negotiations over future steps faltered, a position, he said, that had the support of President-elect Trump. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Prime Minister (through translator): As soon as he was elected, President Trump engaged in the mission of freeing hostages. He spoke with me on Wednesday evening and welcomed the agreement and rightly emphasized that the first step of the agreement is a temporary ceasefire. We reserve the right to return to war if necessary with the backing of the United States. John Yang: Even as Netanyahu spoke, the Israeli military prepared to receive hostages and to deliver much needed aid to Gaza devastated by 15 months of war. Anshel Pfeffer is the Israel correspondent for The Economist. Mr. Pfeffer, Netanyahu saying he can't move forward without this list from Hamas. Is this just a hiccup or is this something more serious? Anshel Pfeffer, Israeli Correspondent, The Economist: Well, based on what we saw back in November 23, when we had the previous large release of hostages, this is the kind of perhaps technical glitch or a last minute attempt by Hamas to exert some kind of psychological warfare on the Israeli public. But usually the lists are handed in on time. And as we saw back then Netanyahu speak, I think once the deal has been signed, we will start seeing, hopefully tomorrow, hostages being released and the ceasefire, at least the first stage of the ceasefire taking place. John Yang: Walk us through this. You say the first stage. It's supposed to have several phases. What's supposed to happen in this first phase? That's supposed to begin tomorrow. Anshel Pfeffer: So this is a six-week phase in which there'll be every week a number of Israeli hostages will be released in return. Israel released dozens of Palestinian prisoners from its jails and on the ground in Gaza, the Israeli army will stop firing, will stop attacking Hamas targets and there will be a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces, not a total withdrawal in this phase. And also gradually, Palestinians who are displaced by the war will be allowed to return to their homes, or what's left of their homes. There's also supposed to be talks between Israel and Hamas over the next stage, which is a comprehensive full ceasefire. And also for the third stage, which is a reconstruction of Gaza. John Yang: What are the challenges about this getting to that second stage, which sounds much tougher for a complete withdrawal from Gaza? Anshel Pfeffer: Israel is back on the borders of Gaza. There's a question of what kind of security guarantees, what kind of security arrangements will be in place. From Hamas's perspective, there's a question of does it assume full control of Gaza again? Will there be perhaps an alternative Palestinian force coming in to work on security? There are other partners as well. Egypt has a border with Gaza. What's the status going to be on the border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, which currently Israel controls? If Israel isn't there, does Hamas control it? Does someone else? Does the Palestinian Authority move in and control it? All these things will continue to be the subject of the talks and there's a lot of potential there for things to go wrong. And that move from the first to the second stage is what everybody's looking now that's really fraught with difficulty. John Yang: And what are the Israeli pledges on aid for Gaza? Anshel Pfeffer: According to the deal, 600 trucks a day are to bring aid into Gaza. So that's basically returning to the pre-October 7th levels even a bit higher because some of the capacity food in Gaza isn't there anymore and therefore there's a higher need of aid. But once again, this is something very temporary. We're talking here about 42 days in which there will be, there is a guarantee of the aid going in. The question is what happens next. John Yang: Anshel Pfeffer, The Economist in Israel, thank you very much. Anshel Pfeffer: Thanks for having me.

       "      <td>Tommy Tuberville and J.D. Vance have really earned some friendship bracelets. As long as nobody calls it a cult or anything. On Monday, two United States senators, Tommy Tuberville and J.D. Vance, took a pilgrimage to the Manhattan courthouse in which Michael Cohen was explaining to a jury everything he did while being paid by the former president* to be a schmuck to the entire outside world. By all accounts, Cohen was a model witness, though we should hold all tickets on that bet until we see how he does under cross-examination. Far more interesting werethe two legislative acolyteswho came to pay homage. It’s like the courthouse is now Fatima, with farts. From Politico: And they weren’t alone. The senators were joined in their witness by Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, Republican of New York, as well as the attorneys general of Iowa and Alabama, who apparently have little to do these days. Taxpayers in those two states certainly got their money’s worth paying the salaries of these two clucks. Moreover, Tuesday promised even more pilgrims to the shrine. Vivek Ramaswamy, re-emerging from having his operating systems updated, promised to come and pay tribute, as didSpeaker of the House of RepresentativesMike Johnson. For the benefit of those keeping score at home, Speaker Moses, who is a very good Christian man, is going to New York to support an unapologetic defendant in a criminal scheme that violated at least half the Ten Commandments. That should be a tinhorn tent revival of a type unseen since Jimmy Swaggarttook to the podium and tearfully coppedto doing missionary work in various motels in the neighborhood we like to call Out by the Airport. It is Politico’s analysis that these pilgrims are coming to court in order to meet the press and say all the stuff the defendant can’t say because Judge Juan Merchan may toss him in the hoosegow. How did these young journos ever get so cynical? Speaker Moses Is Donald Trump’s Puppet We’re Fighting Over How High to Raise the Flag Now I’m...in Agreement with Steven Bannon?

       "      <td>Outgoing PresidentJoe Bidenissued alast-minute set of grants for clemency, which included members of his family, Democratic politicians and Native American activist Leonard Peltier, who was convicted of killing two FBI agents in a 1975 shootout on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota — a charge that he has steadfastly denied. Preliminary pardons were given to James B. Biden, the outgoing president's brother; Sara Jones Biden, James' wife; Valerie Biden Owens, the outgoing president's sister; John T. Owens, Valerie's husband; and Francis W. Biden, the outgoing president's brother. None of them have been charged with an offense, but Biden had been concerned that newly sworn-in PresidentDonald Trumpand his allies would go after them in a quest for vengeance. Related “I believe in the rule of law, and I am optimistic that the strength of our legal institutions will ultimately prevail over politics,” Biden wrote. “But baseless and politically motivated investigations wreak havoc on the lives, safety and financial security of targeted individuals and their families. Even when individuals have done nothing wrong and will ultimately be exonerated, the mere fact of being investigated or prosecuted can irreparably damage their reputations and finances.” Thanks to Biden's commutation of his life sentence, Peltier, the Native American activist, will now be allowed to spend his remaining years in home confinement. While Peltier had admitted to participating in the shootout, he maintains that he did not kill the FBI agents and has released a stream ofdefiant lettersto supporters from jail.Human rights watchdogsandactivists, as well as numerous international figures like Nelson Mandela and Mother Theresa, had advocated for clemency since his imprisonment, with many of them alleging that he is being wrongfully held as a political prisoner. In a statement, Biden officials acknowledged the calls for clemency and Peltier's \"advanced age, illnesses, his close ties to and leadership in the Native American community and the substantial length of time he has already spent in prison.” Two other individuals —  Gerald G. Lundergan and Ernest William Cromartie — were given an even greater prize: full pardons. Lundergan, a businessman and former Democratic state legislator in Kentucky, was convicted in 2019 of making illegal campaign contributions to his daughter's failed 2014 effort to unseat Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Cromartie, a former Democratic city council member in Columbia, South Carolina, was convicted of tax evasion. Read more about Biden's pardons  Copyright © 2025 Salon.com, LLC.

       "      <td>Should we look to the once and future president’s past business dealings? The once and future president’s sudden lust for the Panama Canal rang a bell deep in the blog’s cortex. Sure, he was just running his mouth. (Chinese troops are running the canal? Which of his brainiac advisors came up with that one? Was it noted geopolitician Professor Otto Yerass? Probably.)  But something else was familiar, so we considered the shebeen’s Director of Research, Dr. Google.This is what he produced. FromTheIndependent: Did all the fcks gather in a cluster? Let’s guess. Is the Trump Organization’s vetting procedure limited to one question—“Do you have lots of money, or can you pretend you do?” Opinions vary. The Trump Organization, of course, denied any knowledge of Nogueira, who blew town while awaiting trial on unrelated charges. And while the echoes of a cock crowing were still resounding, some of the tower’s tenants sued the organization for being lousy real estate managers—a family trademark—and the once and future countersued for $75 million. In 2017, things got physical. Ultimately, to the surprise of absolutely nobody, in 2018, this all wound up in court in New York. The Fintiklis side charged that the Trump Organization had played fast and loose with the tax laws, and that it was a lousy landlord. The Trump side denied everything. A Panamanian court later ruled in Fintiklis’s favor, and Trump’s name was torn from the side of the building, which is now a Marriott property. (The winning side dropped the suit in 2021.) It may sound cynical, but I suspect that the once and future president might have an ax to grind against Panama itself. In fact, I suspect that we may all well be deafened by the sound of 1,000 axes, grinding, over the next four years.

Strands requires the player to perform a twist on the classic word search. Words can be made from linked letters — up, down, left, right, or diagonal, but words can also change direction, resulting in quirky shapes and patterns. Every single letter in the grid will be part of an answer. There's always a theme linking every solution, along with the \"spangram,\" a special, word or phrase that sums up that day's theme, and spans the entire grid horizontally or vertically. By providing an opaque hint and not providing the word list, Strands creates a brain-teasing game that takes a little longer to play than its other games, likeWordleandConnections.

Melania Trumparrived at the ceremony on Monday wearing anoutfit by American designer Adam Lippes, according to fashion website WWD — but what everyone is talking about is the incoming first lady's hat, the work of American designer Eric Javits. The wide-rimmed hat, a dark navy with a white ribbon, partially shields Trump's face, and immediately evoked a sharp reaction. Some users on X admired the look: Others, however, harkened it to fictional characters Zorro, a masked vigilante, and Carmen Sandiego, a criminal mastermind: There were also comparisons to theBabadook, the titular horror character of Jennifer Kent's 2014 film(combined with the Quaker Oat man...) Melania looks like a combination of the Babadook and the Quaker Oats man[image or embed] Given that the hat obscured Trump's face, there was also speculation that the sartorial choice would fuelconspiracy theories about a \"fake\" Melania: As today goes on, the conversation is sure to steer away from fashion and towards whatever executive orders Donald Trump will sign on day one of his second term as president.

Posting to Truth Social on Jan. 19, Trump wrote that he was looking to “extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect” and foster a \"deal to protect our national security,\" suggesting that he intends to broker a joint venture that would result in an American company taking 50 percent ownership. He called on companies to \"not let TikTok go dark\"and said he could \"confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.\" TikTok quickly responded, saying it was workingtoreinstate servicefollowing Trump's statements. The app was up and running for existing users shortly after, although it still remains off U.S. app stores. \"We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive,\"wrotethe platformon their official policy account on X. Despite Trump only promising to work on saving the app, and not yet bestowed with executive power, a new pop-up notification on the platform reads: Welcome back!Thanks for your patience and support. As a result of President Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.!You can continue to create, share, and discover all the things you love on TikTok. In a reversal from hisprevious stance and executive ordersduring his first presidential term, Trump has turned in favor of the China-owned company over the last year. Last month, the president-elect sent an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court arguing he isuniquely positioned to save TikTokand protect the country's national security objectives, asking the court to grant a stay on the ban. The court laterupheld the ban. Trump and tech's biggest names have been courting each other's favor for months, especially following Trump's campaign victory. On Jan. 17, TikTok CEO Shou Chewposted a public messageto users in which he thanked Trump for his efforts to reinstate the app. \"This is a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship,\" said Chew. \"We are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform — one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process.\" Not long after the app went dark, TikTok altered an in-app pop up message alerting users to the ban. The original message read: We regret that a U.S. law banning TikTok will take effect on January 19 and force us to make our services temporarily unavailable.We're working to restore our service in the U.S. as soon as possible, and we appreciate your support. Please stay tuned. The revised notification read: A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now.We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned! The pop-up was then removed. It's not just TikTok, either. Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Tesla/ X owner Elon Musk, who is set toscore an advisory positionunder the new administration, have also publicly praised Trump and his policy positions, particularly surrounding hiscontroversial stances on content moderationand free speech. Meta recently overhauled itsmoderationandDEIpolicies in the name of a more \"free speech\" supportive platform, abolishing its diversity mandates and loosening its hate speech policies to includepreviously bannedforms of content. And OpenAI's Sam Altman hasdefended his decisionto donate millions in personal contributions to Trump's inaugural fund, in response to a letter from U.S. Senators hinting at possible corruption. Many of Big Tech's inner circle, including Chew, areexpected to appearat the inaugural swearing-in ceremony on Monday.

       "1310  Ahead of Donald Trump’ssecond inaugurationon Monday, January 20, several pre-inauguration events have been held across Washington D.C. The Trumps, Republicans, and Trump’s inner circle turned out for private dinners and fireworks in a show of strength. Their sartorial choices said as much. As we saw throughout Trump’s previous presidential tenure, clothing and fashion played a significant part in the Trumpian narrative. Where Melania Trump’schoice of dresscould propel a designer into the discourse and subtle and not-so-hidden messages were communicated through clothing. A ceremony or presidential engagement look can be a show of strength, stoicism, or defiance. With the Bidens exiting the White House,Dr. Biden’s choiceof traditional American designers comes to mind: American-in-Paris Daniel Roseberry forSchiaparelli, Tom Ford, Ralph Lauren, and even Jackie Kennedy’s go-to Oscar de la Renta.Michelle Obama’s allegiance to both emerging and under-appreciated designers too: such as Jason Wu andIsabel Toledo. Predictions abound for who will dress the incoming second-time first lady—who was fond of Louboutin, Dior, Dolce & Gabbana, and Ralph Lauren the first time around—and what the next fuschia pussybow blouse or “I Really Don’t Care—Do U?” moments will be. This weekend’s pre-inauguration events offer clues for what to expect. Vice President-elect JD Vance and his wife Usha Vance hosted the vice presidential dinner at the National Gallery of Art on January 18 in Washington, DC. For the black tie event, Usha wore a custom noir velvet gown with asymmetric floral accents and a sweetheart neckline by Oscar de la Renta. Vance wore a classic tuxedo. The incoming vice president'sown clothing choiceshave been a discussion point for the last few weeks, as he seems to be mirroring Trump’s most outlandish looks, swapping his Silicon Valley-stuck windbreakers, shrunken, single-breasted suits, and chinos for Republican red ties (a Trump signature), and wider-tailored suits. For Saturday’s event, he gave his beard a trim: Something of note, given it’s been more than a century since a sitting president or vice president has had such prominent facial hair. The incoming Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was also present and wore a navy and black lapel jacket, a white tuxedo shirt with black piping, accessorized with a bow tie and white pocket scarf. His wife, the actor Cheryl Hines, wore an off-the-shoulder black dress with feather detailing. Tiffany Trump attended with husband Michael Boulos; she wore a black sweetheart neckline dress. Eric Trump with his wife Lara were also present. On Friday, Donald Trump Jr. and his partner Bettina Anderson attended the Crypto Ball in Washington D.C., sporting a patriotic look. He wore a tuxedo and bowtie, with American flag cufflinks and dress shirt buttons that spelled out ‘MAGA’. Trump and Melania began their celebrations at his golf club in Sterling, Virginia, just outside of Washington, with a fireworks showcase. The Trump family, also including Ivanka and Jared Kushner, were in attendance. Melania wore a gray Dior coat and a Dolce & Gabbana pantsuit, while Bettina and Tiffany wore white, buttoned-up coats. Ivanka wore a black wool coat and dress. The Trump clan and his chosen incoming cabinet appeared for a wreath laying by Trump and J.D. Vance at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia on January 19. Melania went monochrome and an almost military-style: a black, buttoned Dior cape coat with elbow-length black leather gloves and knee-high Christian Louboutin boots. Usha was the opposite, in a white, a-line wool coat and dress from Sergio Hudson, with brown leather gloves and matching brown knee-high leather boots. Ivanka wore a beige, floral applique Oscar de la Renta coat with brown leather gloves, and Tiffany wore a grey, princess-style belted coat with silver buttons. Also on the eve of the inauguration ceremony, a candlelit dinner was held at at the National Building Museum in Washington D.C.. Melania wore a Saint Laurent tuxedo cape, with a white Dolce & Gabbana shirt, a Ralph Lauren belt, Carolina Herrera sequin skirt, and Manolo Blahnik pumps to watch her husband deliver his speech. Ivanka wore a custom off-shoulder crystal and pearl floral-embroidered empire waist gown with a silver stole by Oscar de la Renta. Usha Vance wore a deep purple, one-shoulder gown by Indian couturier Gaurav Gupta. Other notable guests included SpaceX and Tesla’s Elon Musk, Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos and his partnerLauren Sánchez. Sánchez wore a black Dolce & Gabbana dress with a sweetheart neckline and crystal corset. As the events continue to unfold, following the sartorial choices of the first family and their inner circle through uncertain and turbulent times will prove interesting.

John Yang speaks with Anshel Pfeffer, Israel correspondent for The Economist, for the latest. Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. John Yang: Good evening. I'm John Yang. Just 12 hours before the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel is to go into effect, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it would not go forward until Hamas made good on its agreement to provide a list of the hostages they're going to release. Netanyahu also said that Israel could resume fighting if negotiations over future steps faltered, a position, he said, that had the support of President-elect Trump. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Prime Minister (through translator): As soon as he was elected, President Trump engaged in the mission of freeing hostages. He spoke with me on Wednesday evening and welcomed the agreement and rightly emphasized that the first step of the agreement is a temporary ceasefire. We reserve the right to return to war if necessary with the backing of the United States. John Yang: Even as Netanyahu spoke, the Israeli military prepared to receive hostages and to deliver much needed aid to Gaza devastated by 15 months of war. Anshel Pfeffer is the Israel correspondent for The Economist. Mr. Pfeffer, Netanyahu saying he can't move forward without this list from Hamas. Is this just a hiccup or is this something more serious? Anshel Pfeffer, Israeli Correspondent, The Economist: Well, based on what we saw back in November 23, when we had the previous large release of hostages, this is the kind of perhaps technical glitch or a last minute attempt by Hamas to exert some kind of psychological warfare on the Israeli public. But usually the lists are handed in on time. And as we saw back then Netanyahu speak, I think once the deal has been signed, we will start seeing, hopefully tomorrow, hostages being released and the ceasefire, at least the first stage of the ceasefire taking place. John Yang: Walk us through this. You say the first stage. It's supposed to have several phases. What's supposed to happen in this first phase? That's supposed to begin tomorrow. Anshel Pfeffer: So this is a six-week phase in which there'll be every week a number of Israeli hostages will be released in return. Israel released dozens of Palestinian prisoners from its jails and on the ground in Gaza, the Israeli army will stop firing, will stop attacking Hamas targets and there will be a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces, not a total withdrawal in this phase. And also gradually, Palestinians who are displaced by the war will be allowed to return to their homes, or what's left of their homes. There's also supposed to be talks between Israel and Hamas over the next stage, which is a comprehensive full ceasefire. And also for the third stage, which is a reconstruction of Gaza. John Yang: What are the challenges about this getting to that second stage, which sounds much tougher for a complete withdrawal from Gaza? Anshel Pfeffer: Israel is back on the borders of Gaza. There's a question of what kind of security guarantees, what kind of security arrangements will be in place. From Hamas's perspective, there's a question of does it assume full control of Gaza again? Will there be perhaps an alternative Palestinian force coming in to work on security? There are other partners as well. Egypt has a border with Gaza. What's the status going to be on the border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, which currently Israel controls? If Israel isn't there, does Hamas control it? Does someone else? Does the Palestinian Authority move in and control it? All these things will continue to be the subject of the talks and there's a lot of potential there for things to go wrong. And that move from the first to the second stage is what everybody's looking now that's really fraught with difficulty. John Yang: And what are the Israeli pledges on aid for Gaza? Anshel Pfeffer: According to the deal, 600 trucks a day are to bring aid into Gaza. So that's basically returning to the pre-October 7th levels even a bit higher because some of the capacity food in Gaza isn't there anymore and therefore there's a higher need of aid. But once again, this is something very temporary. We're talking here about 42 days in which there will be, there is a guarantee of the aid going in. The question is what happens next. John Yang: Anshel Pfeffer, The Economist in Israel, thank you very much. Anshel Pfeffer: Thanks for having me.

Vance have really earned some friendship bracelets. As long as nobody calls it a cult or anything. On Monday, two United States senators, Tommy Tuberville and J.D. Vance, took a pilgrimage to the Manhattan courthouse in which Michael Cohen was explaining to a jury everything he did while being paid by the former president* to be a schmuck to the entire outside world. By all accounts, Cohen was a model witness, though we should hold all tickets on that bet until we see how he does under cross-examination. Far more interesting werethe two legislative acolyteswho came to pay homage. It’s like the courthouse is now Fatima, with farts. From Politico: And they weren’t alone. The senators were joined in their witness by Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, Republican of New York, as well as the attorneys general of Iowa and Alabama, who apparently have little to do these days. Taxpayers in those two states certainly got their money’s worth paying the salaries of these two clucks. Moreover, Tuesday promised even more pilgrims to the shrine. Vivek Ramaswamy, re-emerging from having his operating systems updated, promised to come and pay tribute, as didSpeaker of the House of RepresentativesMike Johnson. For the benefit of those keeping score at home, Speaker Moses, who is a very good Christian man, is going to New York to support an unapologetic defendant in a criminal scheme that violated at least half the Ten Commandments. That should be a tinhorn tent revival of a type unseen since Jimmy Swaggarttook to the podium and tearfully coppedto doing missionary work in various motels in the neighborhood we like to call Out by the Airport. It is Politico’s analysis that these pilgrims are coming to court in order to meet the press and say all the stuff the defendant can’t say because Judge Juan Merchan may toss him in the hoosegow. How did these young journos ever get so cynical? Speaker Moses Is Donald Trump’s Puppet We’re Fighting Over How High to Raise the Flag Now I’m...in Agreement with Steven Bannon?

Preliminary pardons were given to James B. Biden, the outgoing president's brother; Sara Jones Biden, James' wife; Valerie Biden Owens, the outgoing president's sister; John T. Owens, Valerie's husband; and Francis W. Biden, the outgoing president's brother. None of them have been charged with an offense, but Biden had been concerned that newly sworn-in PresidentDonald Trumpand his allies would go after them in a quest for vengeance. Related “I believe in the rule of law, and I am optimistic that the strength of our legal institutions will ultimately prevail over politics,” Biden wrote. “But baseless and politically motivated investigations wreak havoc on the lives, safety and financial security of targeted individuals and their families. Even when individuals have done nothing wrong and will ultimately be exonerated, the mere fact of being investigated or prosecuted can irreparably damage their reputations and finances.” Thanks to Biden's commutation of his life sentence, Peltier, the Native American activist, will now be allowed to spend his remaining years in home confinement. While Peltier had admitted to participating in the shootout, he maintains that he did not kill the FBI agents and has released a stream ofdefiant lettersto supporters from jail.Human rights watchdogsandactivists, as well as numerous international figures like Nelson Mandela and Mother Theresa, had advocated for clemency since his imprisonment, with many of them alleging that he is being wrongfully held as a political prisoner. In a statement, Biden officials acknowledged the calls for clemency and Peltier's \"advanced age, illnesses, his close ties to and leadership in the Native American community and the substantial length of time he has already spent in prison.” Two other individuals —  Gerald G. Lundergan and Ernest William Cromartie — were given an even greater prize: full pardons. Lundergan, a businessman and former Democratic state legislator in Kentucky, was convicted in 2019 of making illegal campaign contributions to his daughter's failed 2014 effort to unseat Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Cromartie, a former Democratic city council member in Columbia, South Carolina, was convicted of tax evasion. Read more about Biden's pardons  Copyright © 2025 Salon.com, LLC.

The once and future president’s sudden lust for the Panama Canal rang a bell deep in the blog’s cortex. Sure, he was just running his mouth. (Chinese troops are running the canal? Which of his brainiac advisors came up with that one? Was it noted geopolitician Professor Otto Yerass? Probably.)  But something else was familiar, so we considered the shebeen’s Director of Research, Dr. Google.This is what he produced. FromTheIndependent: Did all the fcks gather in a cluster? Let’s guess. Is the Trump Organization’s vetting procedure limited to one question—“Do you have lots of money, or can you pretend you do?” Opinions vary. The Trump Organization, of course, denied any knowledge of Nogueira, who blew town while awaiting trial on unrelated charges. And while the echoes of a cock crowing were still resounding, some of the tower’s tenants sued the organization for being lousy real estate managers—a family trademark—and the once and future countersued for $75 million. In 2017, things got physical. Ultimately, to the surprise of absolutely nobody, in 2018, this all wound up in court in New York. The Fintiklis side charged that the Trump Organization had played fast and loose with the tax laws, and that it was a lousy landlord. The Trump side denied everything. A Panamanian court later ruled in Fintiklis’s favor, and Trump’s name was torn from the side of the building, which is now a Marriott property. (The winning side dropped the suit in 2021.) It may sound cynical, but I suspect that the once and future president might have an ax to grind against Panama itself. In fact, I suspect that we may all well be deafened by the sound of 1,000 axes, grinding, over the next four years.
