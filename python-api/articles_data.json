The wide-rimmed hat, a dark navy with a white ribbon, partially shields Trump's face, and immediately evoked a sharp reaction.

        "title": "Camera owner asks Canon, skies: Why is it $5/month for webcam software?",
        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "Just because it's a good rig doesn't mean you can use it on Zoom. Photography enthusiasts pay a lot for their very powerful cameras. How much more should they pay to put them to much, much easier work as a webcam? However many hundreds of dollars you paid, Canon thinks you should pay $5 per month—or, heck, just $50 per year—to do that. Roman Zipp detailed his journey from incredulousness to grim resignation ina blog post. He bought hisCanon PowerShot G5 X Mark IIfor something like $900 last year. The compact model gave him the right match of focal length and sensor size for concert pics. What it did not give him was the ability to change anything at all about his webcam feed using Canon's software. (The \"$6,299 camera\" referenced in Zipp's blog post title is his indication that all models of Canon's cameras face this conundrum, regardless of price point.) Ah, but that's because Zipp did not pay. If you head to Canon's site, provide a name and email, and manage to grab the EOS Webcam utility when Canon's servers are not failing, you can connect one camera, with one default scene, at 720p, 30 frames per second and adjust everything on the camera itself if you need to. Should you pay $5 per month, or $50 per year, you can unlockEOS Webcam Utility Pro(PDF link), which provides full 60 fps video and most of the features you'd expect out of a webcam that cost hundreds fewer dollars. \"Software development isn’t free, and I’m happy to pay for software I use regularly,\" Zipp writes. \"However, Canon is a hardware company, not a software company, and they should—due to the lack of standards—provide software that allows you to use their cameras as intended. Aside from development costs, there’s no justification for a subscription model, particularly from a company earning nearly$3 billion in profit.\" Zipp's pointed complaint made the front page of Hacker News, where commenters immediately got sidetracked into a discussion of UK tariff laws on video equipment, sneakers, cookies, and ethanol. But further in, recommendations appear for the open sourceMagic Lanterncamera add-on software, or possiblyCHDK(Canon Hack Development Kit) firmware. Whether or not Zipp can better use his camera as a webcam is somewhat beside the point, or at least the point he's making. Many higher-end (or at least better-than-smartphone) cameras output video in formats that computers and web conferencing software cannot natively accept. HDMI output is an option, but using that typically requires a capture device and specialty software to mix and use it and that the camera provide \"clean\" HDMI out, with no overlays. The G5 X Mark II does seem to offer that and has a USB-C port. It also seems to work fine once the software is paid for. It's an open question whether Canon should provide this as part of the cost of the camera, one for which Zipp and many commenters have an answer. Ars has reached out to Canon for comment and will update this post if the company responds. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

        "content": "If the Trump admin doesn't alter the process, negotiated prices will go into effect in 2027. Blockbuster weight-loss and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic topthe list of 15 drugsselected for the second round of federal price negotiations, which are scheduled to begin this year, with resulting bargained prices going into effect in 2027. The first round of negotiations, involving 10 high-cost drugs, wrapped up in August, with resulting prices being 38 percent to 79 percent lower than list prices. Those negotiated prices will go into effect in 2026 and are expected to save people with Medicare prescription drug coverage $1.5 billion in out-of-pocket costs. “Last year we proved that negotiating for lower drug prices works,\" Xavier Becerra, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), said in a statement. \"Now we plan to build on that record by negotiating for lower prices for 15 additional important drugs for seniors.\" The list of 15 drugs in the next round is below, in the order provided by HHS. According to the health department, about 5.3 million people with Medicare prescription drug coverage used at least one of these drugs between 2023 and 2024. In that time frame, they collectively accounted for about $41 billion in total gross covered prescription drug costs, or about 14 percent. Topping the list are three versions of semaglutide drugs sold by Novo Nordisk: Wegovy, used for weight loss and to reduce the risks of cardiovascular disease; Ozempic, used for Type 2 diabetes; and Rybelsus, used for Type 2 diabetes. The drugs are as costly as they are popular. Wegovy has a list price of around $1,350, while Ozempic's is nearly $1,000. In an emailed statement to Ars, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said the company is opposed to negotiating the price of these drugs and the negotiations in general. Novo Nordisk is one of many pharmaceutical companies that have sued the government over the negotiation process, which is a provision of the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). \"Novo Nordisk remains opposed to government price setting through the IRA and has significant concerns about how the law is being implemented by this administration, including aggregating multiple products that individually would not meet the requirements of the statute,\" the statement from Novo Nordisk said. \"Even as our IRA lawsuit progresses, we remain committed to working with policymakers to advance solutions to ensure access and affordability for all patients.\" The pharmaceutical industry's legal challenges claim that the negotiations are unconstitutional, an argument that hasso far been unsuccessful in courtsgiven that drug makers are not required to participate in Medicare drug plans. Amid the legal defeats, pharmaceutical industry leaders are planning to ask the Trump administration to pause or alter the negotiations. Earlier this week, the CEO of Eli Lilly—which makes a rival weight loss drug to Novo Nordisk—said he and other drug makers would appeal to the next administration, saying, \"They need to fix [the IRA].\" Novo Nordisk ended its statement today by saying it \"will work with the incoming administration to deliver meaningful solutions for patients.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

        "source": "https://nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "Rates of nearsightedness, or myopia, are skyrocketing in kids—and scientists say it has to do with how little time they’re spending outdoors. Here’s why it’s so good for your vision. There’s a new public health epidemic looming on the horizon: Rates of nearsightedness, also known as myopia, are increasing at alarming speed. The American Optometric Associationestimatesthat myopia diagnoses have climbed more than 25 percent in the past 40 years—and the National Eye Instituteprojectsthat by 2050, close to half the world's population will be nearsighted. The rise is dramatic enough \"it has caused the term 'myopia epidemic' to be used to describe the phenomenon,\" says Marc Mathias, an associate professor of ophthalmology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. (Why are so many children being diagnosed with myopia?) Childrenhave been particularly affectedby the rise in myopia—and scientists think there may be a surprising connection with how little time they are spending outside.One surveyshowsthat in 2022, only 27 percent of children were regularly playing outside compared to the 80 percent of adolescents who were two generations ago. Because of this,a 2024 National Academies reportaddressing the causes and prevention of myopia recommends for parents to get their kids outside more to better protect their eyesight. \"Our report reaffirms what has been in the scientific literature for over 15 years: that increased childhood outdoor time appears to be protective for myopia onset and development,\" saysTerri Young, a co-author of the report and a pediatric ophthalmologist and chair of the University of Wisconsin department of ophthalmology and visual sciences. Here's why sunlight and spending time in nature is so good for eye health—plus how much time outside is needed to reap benefits. Myopia occurs when the shape of the eye becomes elongated, causing distant objects to appear blurry while close objects remain clear. When the eye is elongated, the retina—the tissue that lines the eye and ultimately translates light signals into vision—has to “stretch” to cover it, explains Sara Weidmayer, a practicing Doctor of Optometry in the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System in Michigan. When this elongation occurs, it cannot be reversed and the reduced vision can affect day-to-day life, work and school performance, driving safety, confidence levels, and athletic performance. While eyeglasses or contact lenses are often prescribed, myopia isn't only a matter of inconvenience. (This rare disorder is a leading cause of blindness in young people.) \"When you have elongated eyes, the stretched structures inside are at a much higher risk for many ocular health conditions—some of which can permanently reduce vision and, in some cases, cause vision loss and blindness,\" saysLaura Di Meglio, an instructor of ophthalmology at the Wilmer Ophthalmological Institute at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Some such worrisome eye conditions include glaucoma, premature cataracts, macular degeneration, and retinal tears and detachments. Playing outside and being in the sun improves eye health for everyone, but especially does so for kids. \"For younger children whose eyes are still developing, spending time outdoors helps prevent excessive elongation of the eyeball,\" says Chase Ludwig, a vitreoretinal surgeon at the Byers Eye Institute at Stanford University School of Medicine. This is primarily because bright sunlighttriggers the releaseof a neurotransmitter found in the brain and retina called dopamine, which, he says, \"regulates eye growth and ensures the retina maintains its proper shape.\" Dopamine also helps the eye adapt to different light conditions by regulating how images interact with specific receptors in the retina, adds Inna Lazar, an optometrist practicing in Darien, Connecticut—an interaction that further improves the shape and health of the eye. (4 ways to get more 'nature therapy' into your kid's schedule.) Another benefit of sunlight is that it supports vitamin D production, \"which can strengthen ocular tissues,\" says Isdin Oke, an ophthalmologist at Boston Children's Hospital and an instructor of ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School. He says it does this, in part, by reducing eye inflammation, improving corneal function, and helping with tear secretion. Di Meglio adds that vitamin D also strengthens the outer layer of the eye known as the sclera, \"which helps prevent stretching or thinning.\" Aside from its effect on nearsightedness, \"vitamin D is also thought to play a role in preventing or improving other eye conditions such as age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, dry eye disease, and uveitis due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties,\" says Jacqueline Nguyen, a clinical assistant professor at the University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center. Such reasons are whymultiplestudiesshow that regular outdoor exposure is associated with lower rates of myopia in children. But it’s not just sunlight that keeps your eyes healthy—being outside and away from additional factors that harm your vision can play a role too. For instance, research shows that the time we spend with our eyes glued to screensalso plays a role in the myopia epidemic, says Mathias. One reason for this is that screens and close-up activities don’t give our eyes opportunities to strengthen long-distance sightseeing muscles—and engaging in such activites for prolonged periods \"appear[s] to trigger the eye to elongate in an effort to lessen the accommodative demand that it takes to see clearly up close,\" says Weidmayer. It’s an especially important risk factor for eyes that are young and developing, she adds. This, combined with less-studied concerns related to the blue light emissions of screens, are among the reasons the World Health Organizationhas suggestedthat children under two have no screen time at all and for children ages two to five to limit their screen use to no more than one hour per day. \"Beyond age five, continuing to limit screen time remains important for young children and adolescents with developing eyes,\" adds Mathias. Beyond screen use and excessive up-close activities, some people also attribute rising myopia rates to genetic predispositions, \"but these account for less than 10 percent of myopia variability, as shown ingenome-wide association studies,\" says Ludwig. Such considerations are among the reasons the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine's recentconsensus study reportencourages \"increased outdoor time during daylight for young children and persistent outdoor activity throughout childhood and into young adulthood.\" The amount of time suggested by the report and supported by additional research \"is at least one hour of daily outdoor activity,\" says Oke. Indeed,ameta-analysisfound that spending an hour a day outside results in a 45 percent reductionin myopia incidence while 76 minutes of outdoor activity daily equals a 50 percent reduction risk. It's also important to stay on top of eye exams—especially for children. \"Most young children in America are not receiving eye care,\" says Weidmayer, who notes thatless than 15 percentof preschoolers receive an annual eye exam. \"When myopia starts early in children, it is more likely to progress, and progressive myopia is a very real public health concern,\" she cautions. For children and adults alike, Ludwig advises taking breaks when reading, looking at screens, or engaging in tasks that require doing prolonged up-close work. \"Follow the 20-20-20 rule,\" he suggests, which states that for every 20 minutes of screen-based or other up-close activity, you should look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. \"Following this one tip can significantly reduce eye strain,\" he says. Ditto for ensuring that reading and up-close activity spaces are well-lit and \"maintaining a healthy distance of at least one arm's length from screens.\" While Di Meglio says that increasing the amount of time spent outdoors and following such strategies won’t guarantee long-term eye health, \"any amount of myopia that can be prevented can help reduce the chances of complications and possible vision loss later in life.\" Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2025 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

        "content": "One day before hisinauguration, president-elect Donald Trump pledged to issue aday one executive orderintended to save TikTok, despite being a main proponent of a ban during his first term. Posting to Truth Social on Jan. 19, Trump wrote that he was looking to “extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect” and foster a \"deal to protect our national security,\" suggesting that he intends to broker a joint venture that would result in an American company taking 50 percent ownership. He called on companies to \"not let TikTok go dark\"and said he could \"confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.\" TikTok quickly responded, saying it was workingtoreinstate servicefollowing Trump's statements. The app was up and running for existing users shortly after, although it still remains off U.S. app stores. \"We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive,\"wrotethe platformon their official policy account on X. Despite Trump only promising to work on saving the app, and not yet bestowed with executive power, a new pop-up notification on the platform reads: Welcome back!Thanks for your patience and support. As a result of President Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.!You can continue to create, share, and discover all the things you love on TikTok. In a reversal from hisprevious stance and executive ordersduring his first presidential term, Trump has turned in favor of the China-owned company over the last year. Last month, the president-elect sent an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court arguing he isuniquely positioned to save TikTokand protect the country's national security objectives, asking the court to grant a stay on the ban. The court laterupheld the ban. Trump and tech's biggest names have been courting each other's favor for months, especially following Trump's campaign victory. On Jan. 17, TikTok CEO Shou Chewposted a public messageto users in which he thanked Trump for his efforts to reinstate the app. \"This is a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship,\" said Chew. \"We are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform — one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process.\" Not long after the app went dark, TikTok altered an in-app pop up message alerting users to the ban. The original message read: We regret that a U.S. law banning TikTok will take effect on January 19 and force us to make our services temporarily unavailable.We're working to restore our service in the U.S. as soon as possible, and we appreciate your support. Please stay tuned. The revised notification read: A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now.We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned! The pop-up was then removed. It's not just TikTok, either. Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Tesla/ X owner Elon Musk, who is set toscore an advisory positionunder the new administration, have also publicly praised Trump and his policy positions, particularly surrounding hiscontroversial stances on content moderationand free speech. Meta recently overhauled itsmoderationandDEIpolicies in the name of a more \"free speech\" supportive platform, abolishing its diversity mandates and loosening its hate speech policies to includepreviously bannedforms of content. And OpenAI's Sam Altman hasdefended his decisionto donate millions in personal contributions to Trump's inaugural fund, in response to a letter from U.S. Senators hinting at possible corruption. Many of Big Tech's inner circle, including Chew, areexpected to appearat the inaugural swearing-in ceremony on Monday. UPDATE: Jan. 19, 2025, 1:58 p.m. ESTThis piece was updated to include a new in-app notification added shortly after TikTok reinstated service.

        "content": "National Geographic content straight to your inbox—sign up for our popular newsletters here Tim Anderson’s new book, Hokkaido, is inspired by Japan’s northernmost prefecture, where Western influences and Indigenous cooking create a cuisine like no other. The blend of cultural influences. I was struck by the similarities to Wisconsin, where I’m from. There’s that Midwestern-style agriculture, focusing on crops like corn and potato, and dairy farming. During the Meiji Restoration from the 1870s, the Japanese government enlisted Middle European and Midwestern American agriculturalists to advise on Western farming methods, because these regions share a similar climate and terrain to Hokkaido. That’s why you can find old German beer halls like those in Milwaukee, some even serving German potato salad. A piece of home, but in Japan. And, of course, there’s the important influence of the Indigenous Ainu people, who migrated centuries ago from northern Russia. That’s why I wanted to spotlight Ainu food. I spoke to a lot of Ainu chefs and cooks, but also businesspeople and craftspeople, as well spending time at the National Ainu Museum. As it’s a snowy and volcanic region, the ecosystems contribute to the seaweed’s flavour, helping to produce top-quality kombu. This also means delicious seafood: crab, scallop and salmon. Seafood from Hokkaido features on menus at high-end establishments across Japan, but it’s even fresher and cheaper at the source. Hokkaido isn’t hot or wet enough to be a rice-growing region, so it imports a lot of rice from the rest of Japan, as well as from China, Korea and Taiwan. Even before the Meiji Restoration, the Ainu traded seafood and kombu for rice. Native grains and wheat have also, unsurprisingly,played a key role in the cuisine. Due to the abundance of wheat, wheatramen is one of the most popular Hokkaido dishes. Hops grow wild along railroads, and the availability of hops and barley explain products like Sapporo beer. Grains like millet and pearl barley, as well as legumes like soybeans, are used to bulkout rice. Plants like wild garlic and butterbur, often foraged. The latter has giant leaves (used as shelter for korpokkur gnomes, according to Ainu folklore), which are grilled, dried or used in soups. There’s also confectionery using Hokkaido milk and butter, like milk butter ice cream and milk bread, as well as chocolates, biscuits, cheesecakes and crackers, often also using local wheat. There’s a real focus on natural produce, so these confections are popular as omiyage (gifting souvenirs). Even though it’s a wintry place, there’s great fruit, which you might not expect, such as sweet melons, strawberries and grapes. Plants from the multicoloured flower fields, like lavender, are used to flavour everything from shaved ice to coffees. Spirituality. In Ainu culture, there are kamuy (spirit deities) within certain living things, elements and even tools, as well as kamuy that oversee some creatures. When you take food from the environment, by hunting, foraging or fishing, it’s important to give thanks to the appropriate kamuy. This translates into a respect for crops — for example, wild garlic is cut above the root to make sure it grows back. This is practically important, too, in a region that has little vegetation for more than half the year. At Washo Market in Kushiro, dozens of in-season seafood varieties are used to make the most amazing breakfast dishes, such as a seafood rice bowl. I love the spaghetti katsu at Izumiya restaurant and, in the evening, the robata joints serve up small plates of grilled local seafood. Zangi [Hokkaido-style fried chicken] and thin, crinkly noodles in a light soy sauce broth with lard are also great Kushiro specialities. I’d recommend the traditional Ainu food and fusion plates in the Ainu village at Lake Akan. At Abashiri, a former prison, the museum cafe serves the old prison menu for lunch, and it’s delicious. Another must is chanchanyaki, a fisherman’s dish of salmon cooked on a hot plate with cabbage, bean sprouts and onions. There’s more opportunity to learn about Ainu food now. The National Ainu Museum offers cooking classes and has small farms growing traditional crops. There are also a few more Ainu restaurants; in 2005, there was only one Ainu restaurant in Sapporo, run out of a family home, which closed two years later due to lack of interest. There are some issues around appropriation of Ainu art and decor, but it’s great to see renewed interest in Ainu food culture. I hope people try the Ainu recipes in the book — they’re accessible and tasty.  Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2025 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

        "title": "'The Brutalist' AI backlash, explained",
        "source": "https://mashable.com/",
        "content": "Brady Corbert'sThe Brutalistis one of the mostprominently featured filmsin this year's awards season, including widespread Oscar expectations of a Best Picture nod. Set in the aftermath of World War II, it tells the story of László Tóth (Adrien Brody), a fictional Hungarian-Jewish architect forced to immigrate to the United States without his family. The film's commitment to form is evident not only in its cinematic portrayal of Brutalism, the postwar period's definingarchitectural movement,but also in its reverence to American cinema of the time. Shot almost entirely onVistaVision(a format widely abandoned in the 1960s with the emergence of70mmandCinemaScope),The Brutalistmakes an event out of its theatrical screenings, with a 15-minute in-roll intermission splitting its colossal runtime of three hours and 34 minutes. It is perhaps this return to the cinematic spectacle of the mid-20th century that has made some viewThe Brutalist’s use of an AI speech-enhancing softwareas some sort of betrayal to the craft and not as another tool available to filmmakers to enhance the impact and credibility of their storytelling.Concerns over the film industry's increasing use of AIare not unique toThe Brutalist, with recent controversies including the horrorLate Night With the Devil, Netflix's sci-fi anime shortThe Dog & The Boy, and Marvel'sSecret Invasion. But what happened and how exactly didThe Brutalistuse AI? Speaking toRedShark News,The Brutalisteditor Dávid Jancsó explained that the team usedsoftware by Ukrainian AI company Respeecherto refine Brody and co-star Felicity Jones' Hungarian pronunciation in the film. In the interview, Jancsó, himself a Hungarian speaker, talks about the difficulties of sounding native in his language. Hungarian is a Uralic language, a linguistic branch which also includes Finnish and Estonian, and some of its sounds are challenging to Anglo-Saxon speakers, even if they happen to be some of the world’s most talented actors. Respeecher'svoice conversion systembuilds a database of what a person sounds like — their language, accent or other specific features (such as a lisp), then allowing an actor to perform their lines as the tool alters their voice. InThe Brutalist’s case, according to Jancsó, the AI speech enhancer was only used to substitute the sound of certain letters that the actors found challenging to pronounce. According to Jancsó, Brody and Jones were aware of the alterations, and most of the corrected pronunciation was read out by the editor himself. \"Most of their Hungarian dialogue has a part of me talking in there. We were very careful about keeping their performances. It's mainly just replacing letters here and there. You can do this in ProTools yourself, but we had so much dialogue in Hungarian that we really needed to speed up the process otherwise we'd still be in post,\" Jancsó told the publisher. In his interview with RedShark News, Jancsó states that these alterations would have been made regardless, but that Respeecher’s AI tool significantly sped up the process, saving the production time and money, which was especially important asThe Brutalistwas completed on a slim $10 million budget. It only takes looking into Respeecher's body of work to know thatThe Brutalistis far from the first film using AI tools in its post-production. Speech enhancing for Hollywood productions has been the Ukrainian company's bread and butter, and the company is credited forrestoring Darth Vader’s voicefor theObi-Wan Kenobiseries after actor James Earl Jones retired, as well asrecreating French singer Edith Piaf's voiceto posthumously \"narrate\" her own biopic, which isstill in the making. Beyond the film world, Respeecher has been using its technologyto help preserve the endangered Crimean Tatar language, which faces increased repressions under Russia’s occupation of Crimea. Not just used for voice corrections, however, AI was also employed to create some of Toth's architectural drawings and finished buildings featured in the Venice Biennale sequence towards the end of the film, according to Jancsó, though he doesn't specify (at the time of this article) what AI tool was used and whether the drawings were completely AI-generated. \"It is controversial in the industry to talk about AI, but it shouldn't be,\" the editor told RedShark News. \"We should be having a very open discussion about what tools AI can provide us with. There's nothing in the film using AI that hasn't been done before. It just makes the process a lot faster. We use AI to create these tiny little details that we didn't have the money or the time to shoot.\" There have been growing concerns about the use of generative AI at the expense of filmmakers, from screenwriting to acting to music production. It was one of the main instigating topics of the 2023Writers Guild of America (WGA)andScreen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA)strikes in 2023. After months of negotiations, the strikers reachedtentative agreementswhich aim to regulate the use of AI in the film industry. Whether or not these revelations will affectThe Brutalist's Oscar standing remains to be seen — the nominees will be announced on Thursday, Jan. 23. But they've ignited a fresh conversation around the use of AI in movie and TV production, whether the production team was ready to find themselves within it or not.

A group of people visiting the Turks and Caicos islands captured video of debris from the failed SpaceX rocket flying overhead, as the wreckage left behind a colorful stream of smoke. SpaceX launched its Starship rocket on its latest test flight Thursday, but the spacecraft was destroyed following a thrilling booster catch back at the pad. Elon Musk’s company said the spacecraft’s six engines appeared to shut down one by one, with contact lost just 8 1/2 minutes into the flight. SpaceX’s mega rocket Starship launches for a test flight from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas, Thursday, Jan. 16, 2025. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) SpaceX’s mega rocket Starship booster returns to the launch pad during a test flight from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas, Thursday, Jan. 16, 2025. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)       CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — SpaceX suspects a fire may have caused itsStarship to break apartduring liftoff and send trails offlaming debrisnear the Caribbean. SpaceX’sElon Musksaid preliminary indications are that leaking fuel built up pressure in the cavity above the engine firewall. The resulting fire would have doomed the spacecraft. On Friday, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered SpaceX to investigate what went wrong. The FAA said there were no reports of injuries from Starship debris. The400-foot Starship— the world’s biggest and most powerful rocket — launched from the southern tip of Texas on a test flight early Thursday evening. The booster made it back to the pad for a catch by giant mechanical arms, only the second time in Starship history. But the engines on the still ascending spacecraft shut down one by one, and communication was lost 8 1/2 minutes into the flight. Dramatic video taken near the Turks and Caicos Islands showed spacecraft debris raining down from the sky in a stream of fireballs. Flights near the falling debris had to be diverted, the FAA said. SpaceX said Starship remained in its designated launch corridor over the Gulf of Mexico and then the Atlantic. Any surviving wreckage would have fallen along that path over water, the company said on its website. Starship had been shooting for a controlled entry over the Indian Ocean, halfway around the world. Ten dummy satellites, mimicking SpaceX’s Starlink internet satellites, were on board so the company could practice releasing them.  It was the seventh test flight of a Starship, but it featured a new and upgraded spacecraft. The FAA said it must approve SpaceX’s accident findings and any corrective actions. SpaceX said the booster and spacecraft for the eighth demo are already built and undergoing testing. Musk said on X the loss was “barely a bump in the road” in his plans to build a fleet of Starships to carry people to Mars. NASA already has booked two Starships to land astronauts on the moon later this decade under its Artemis program, the successor to Apollo. “Spaceflight is not easy. It’s anything but routine,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson posted on X after the accident. “That’s why these tests are so important.” Earlier Thursday, Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin company also had mixed results with the debut of its massive New Glenn rocket. It achieved orbit on its first try, putting a test satellite thousands of miles above Earth. But the booster was destroyed after failing to land on a floating platform in the Atlantic.

        "content": "\"The computed numbers below prove that this is quite feasible with margins to spare.\" Welcome to Edition 7.27 of the Rocket Report! Thursday was an eventful day in super heavy lift launch, with Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket having a highly successful debut launch before dawn in Florida, at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Then, on Thursday afternoon, an upgraded Starship took flight from South Texas. The first stage performed well, but the Starship upper stage experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly during its ascent. Ars will, of course, have full and ongoing coverage. As always, wewelcome reader submissions, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar. RFA receives launch license. The UK Civil Aviation Authority has issued Rocket Factory Augsburg a vertical launch license to conduct the inaugural flight of its RFA ONE rocket from SaxaVord Spaceport in Scotland,European Spaceflight reports. The license is for the launch of the company's RFA One rocket, which has an advertised payload of 1.3 metric tons to low-Earth orbit. RFA said it intends to complete the launch sometime this year. A new era for BritSpace... The company might have launched sooner, but last year, a fire during testing destroyed the rocket’s first stage, forcing RFA to build a replacement before proceeding with the initial launch attempt. An orbital-class rocket has never launched in a vertical configuration before from the United Kingdom, and no rocket has ever successfully reached orbit from there. \"This is a new era for aerospace, and granting the first vertical launch license from UK soil builds toward a historic milestone for the nation,\" said Rob Bishton, chief executive of the civil authority. (submitted by EllPeaTea) Chinese rocket launches from sea platform. China launched a Jielong-3 solid rocket from a mobile sea platform late Sunday, successfully placing 10 Centispace navigation enhancement satellites into orbit,Space News reports. This was the fifth Jielong-3 (or Smart Dragon-3) solid propellant rocket, and it lifted off from a specially converted sea barge off the coast of Haiyang city in the Eastern province of Shandong. Seeking to scale up quickly... The launch was carried out using facilities belonging to the Haiyang Eastern spaceport for sea launches. The spaceport plans more than 10 for 2025, having conducted six sea launches in 2024. The launch was China’s second orbital launch attempt of 2025 and the second success in as many tries. Utah considering a spaceport. State Sen. Jerry Stevenson has introduced a bill to form a committee that would investigate whether Utah should invest in a spaceport and what benefits it could bring to the state,KUTV Salt Lake City reports. The legislation would provide $500,000 for a committee to study the potential benefits of a launch site. Stevenson said the committee would look into both scientific uses and opportunities to expand Utah’s tourism industry, but questions remain over whether such a taxpayer-funded investment makes financial sense. Something to build on... When asked how the state would get a return on its investment, Stevenson said the spaceport would align with Utah’s current industries and infrastructure. \"We think that this fits very well into what’s going on in the state of Utah and what’s already here and what we can build on,\" Stevenson said. Still, critics wondered if the state should focus on space tourism, especially given the potential costs, possibly on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars. Stoke Space goes nova in fundraising round. The Washington-based launch company announced Wednesday that it had raised $260 million in Series C funding, a significant capital raise at a time when it has become more difficult for some space companies to attract funding,Ars reports. \"The market is tough, but I think what we’re doing is poised to go straight to the end state of the industry, and I think investors recognize that,\" said Andy Lapsa, Stoke Space's co-founder and chief executive officer. Full reuse right out of the gate... By \"end state of the industry,\" Lapsa means that Stoke is developing a fully reusable medium-lift rocket named Nova. The vehicle's first stage will land vertically, similar to a Falcon 9 rocket, and the second stage, which has a novel metallic heat shield and engine design, will also land back on Earth. Historically, it is unlikely for a company to move from engine testing to a first orbital launch attempt in the same year, so a Nova debut in 2026 seems more likely. Nevertheless, the new funding from investors signals confidence that Stoke is making credible technical progress on its vehicle development. (submitted by EllPeaTea) The initial launch plan for Neutron. Rocket Lab is closing in on the completion of its Neutron rocket, and the company plans to launch the medium-lift booster for the first time later this year. With a capacity of 13 metric tons to low-Earth orbit, the rocket will be sold at a cost of $50 million to undersell SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket for megaconstellation launches. Falcon 9 can launch 17.5 metric tons to LEO in a reusable configuration, which is often a higher capability than the customer needs,Payload reports. So on a price-per-launch basis, if Neutron can deliver, it could provide credible competition. A slow ramp-up... Rocket Lab intends to launch a single Neutron this year, followed by three rockets in 2026 and five in 2027. This may not be as flashy as saying the company will ramp up to a dozen rockets next year, but I appreciate the realism in launch cadence. Companies never increase their launch cadence as quickly as they say they will. However, speaking of realism, it's realistic to question whether Neutron will actually make it to the launch pad this year. I'd bet no, but I'd love to be proven wrong. Two lunar landers launch on Falcon 9. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida early Wednesday and deployed two commercial lunar landers on separate trajectories to reach the Moon in the next few months,Ars reports.  It took about an hour and a half for the Falcon 9 rocket to release both payloads into two slightly different orbits, ranging up to 200,000 and 225,000 miles (322,000 and 362,000 kilometers) from Earth. A lunar double shot... The two robotic lunar landers—one from Firefly Aerospace based near Austin, Texas, and another from the Japanese space company ispace—will use their own small engines for the final maneuvers required to enter orbit around the Moon in the coming months. Firefly and ispace reported that their landers, each about the size of an SUV, were healthy as ground teams in Texas and Japan activated the spacecraft soon after their separation from the Falcon 9 launch vehicle. ArianeGroup completes Prometheus engine test. Although it was not revealed until January 9, ArianeGroup completed a successful hot fire test of the Prometheus rocket engine in late December 2024,European Spaceflight reports. European Space Agency Director General Josef Aschbacher referred to the \"very important\" test during his annual press briefing. Afterward, an ESA spokesperson confirmed that the test had taken place on December 19 on the PF20 test bench at the ArianeGroup facilities in Vernon, France. A nominal test... The test of the liquid oxygen and biomethane engine lasted for 41 seconds, with the engine reaching 100 percent of its thrust. Prometheus is slated to initially power the Themis reusable booster demonstrator, a project also being developed by ArianeGroup under an ESA contract. In addition to its use by Themis, Prometheus will also be utilized by ArianeGroup subsidiary MaiaSpace to power its partially reusable Maia rocket. (submitted by EllPeaTea) The hidden MVP of SpaceX's high cadence. On any given day, SpaceX is probably launching a Falcon 9 rocket, rolling one out to the launch pad, or bringing one back into port. With three active Falcon 9 launch pads and an increasing cadence at the Starbase facility in Texas, SpaceX's teams are often doing all three. The company achieved another milestone last Friday with the 25th successful launch and landing of a single Falcon 9 booster. This rocket, designated B1067, launched a batch of 21 Starlink Internet satellites from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida.Ars has reportedon these rocket reuse milestones before, but SpaceX is breaking its own records so often that we've dialed back our coverage. Building a lot of upper stages... SpaceX's accomplishment of 25 flights offers an opportunity to step back and take in some context. Although everyone focuses on reuse, SpaceX is still building new second stages for every launch. The task of building so many spaceships in a year is a tall order. While SpaceX's competency with reusing Falcon 9 boosters gets a lot of attention—landing a rocket is still incredible, even after seeing it nearly 400 times—the high-rate manufacturing of Falcon 9 upper stages is the secret MVP. It also suggests that the company's goal to build 100 Starships a year is not crazy. New Glenn makes a triumphant first flight. For the first time since its founding nearly a quarter of a century ago, Blue Origin has reached orbit. The long-awaited debut launch of the New Glenn rocket, a super-heavy lift vehicle developed largely with private funding, was a smashing success in its debut launch early on Thursday morning,Ars reports. The launch occurred a little more than one hour into the launch window. Liftoff was delayed, at first, by an unspecified issue with properly chilling the BE-4 engines ahead of launch. Then there was a wayward boat. No landing, no problem... Ultimately, the rocket launched at 2:03 am in the morning, local time, at Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The first and second stages both appeared to perform nominally, and the Blue Ring pathfinder was put into its intended orbit. The only downer came a bit later when Blue Origin's Ariane Cornell confirmed that the first stage did not successfully return to a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean. But no one who really understands the difficulties of launching and landing rockets believed that Blue Origin would succeed in catching its first orbital booster, and the company deserves credit for making the attempt rather than criticism for failing to stick the landing. How to do Artemis without SLS or Starship. There has been a lot of discussion about potential changes to the Artemis Program under the incoming Trump administration,including on Ars.In The Space Review, engineer Ajay Kothari offers an architecture that is based on the Falcon Heavy rocket rather than NASA's Space Launch System or SpaceX's Starship rocket. \"The computed numbers below prove that this is quite feasible with margins to spare,\" Kothari wrote about using Falcon Heavy to get Orion to the Moon. \"Although three dockings in LEO would be required for the Orion, there is no refueling need and it is a much smaller number than the Starship HLS refueling estimates.\" There is a catch... Because there is always a catch, right? Kothari writes: \"The lander would have to be built by NASA. It would be like the Apollo 17 Lunar Module, called Challenger, which carried two astronauts to the surface from LLO. It had a mass of 16.5 tons, so the new one here is bookkept at 18 tons wet mass, including higher consumable for a 6.5-day stay.\" If we're being realistic, if NASA were to put out a call for bids for a lunar lander tomorrow, it would not have one in hand before the end of the decade at the very earliest. So if NASA is going to the lunar surface in the 2020s, it's likely Starship or bust. Upgraded Ariane booster to undergo tests. The European Space Agency will begin testing the P160 solid-fuel booster in March 2025,European Spaceflight reports. The booster, which is to be strapped onto the Ariane 6 rocket, will replace the current P120 booster and will be a key element in enabling Arianespace to deliver on an 18-launch contract for Amazon. For 16 of its 18 missions for Amazon to launch Project Kuiper satellites, the Ariane 6 rocket will launch with four of the more powerful boosters. Don't forget about Vega... The P160 motor will replace the P120 booster currently in service. The upgraded boosters will increase the capacity of the Ariane 6 rocketby about 2 tonsto low-Earth orbit. In addition to Ariane 6, the P160 boosters will also be utilized by Avio aboard the upgraded Vega C+ and the company’s next-generation Vega E rocket.

        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "Users are in, new downloads are paused, and Trump's order will face scrutiny. TikTok disappeared for a portion of the weekend, following aSupreme Court decisionthat upheld a2024 federal lawrequiring the app to cease operations in the US unless it was sold by its Chinese owner, ByteDance. TikTok is gradually resuming service in the US, but it has an unclear road ahead. TikTok started greeting US users late Saturday night with a notice stating that \"Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now,\" noting that \"A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US.\" The message changed after it was first deployed, adding a note that \"We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\" TikTok gradually started working again in the US on Sunday, at least on the web. As of 9am Eastern time Monday, users with the app installed could access their accounts again, with a \"Welcome back\" message praising \"President Trump's efforts.\" The app remained unavailable in Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store for Android for new installs, however. Notices on both platforms advise searchers that TikTok and other ByteDance apps are \"not available in the country or region you're in\" (Apple) or that \"Downloads for this app are paused due to current US legal requirements\" (Android). President Trumpposted on Sunday morning on Truth Socialthat he would issue an executive order after his inauguration today to \"extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.\" He added that the order would promise \"no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark\" before such an order. Trump added that he would \"like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture.\" At a rally Sunday, he did not clarify if this meant a US-based business or the government itself. \"So they'll have a partner, the United States, and they'll have a lot of bidders … And there's no risk, we're not putting up any money. All we're doing is giving them the approval without which they don't have anything,\"Trump said Sunday. Trump's order, and TikTok's return to service, both seem at odds with the law—and leadership in the Republican party. Speaker Mike Johnsonsaid on NBC'sMeet the PressSundaythat Congress would \"enforce the law.\" Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.) issued a joint statement Sunday, commending Apple, Microsoft, and Google for \"following the law,\" and noting that other companies \"face ruinous bankruptcy\" for violating it. \"Now that the law has taken effect, there's no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date,\" the statement read. The law states that \"A path to executing a qualified divestiture\" has to be determined before a one-time extension of 90 days can be granted. TikTok's best chance at avoiding a shutdown vanished in last week'sunanimous Supreme Court decisionupholding the divest-or-sell law. Aimed at protecting national security interests from TikTok's Chinese owners having access to the habits and data of 170 million American users, the law was ruled to be \"content-neutral,\" and that the US \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\" Reports atForbes,Bloomberg, and elsewhere have suggested that ByteDance and its Chinese owners could be seeking to use TikTok as a bargaining chip, with maneuvers includinga sale to Trump ally Elon Muskas a means of counteracting Trump's proposed tariffs on Chinese imports. One largely unforeseen side effect of Congress' TikTok-centered actions is thatMarvel Snap, a mobile collectible card and deck-building game,disappeared in similar fashion over the weekend. The game, developed by a California-based team, is published by ByteDance's Nuverse mobile game division. With no web version available,Snapremained unavailable on app stores Monday morning. A message to players with the game installed noted that \"This outage is a surprise to us and wasn't planned,\" though it pledged to restore the game.

        "content": "At least 40 states are under cold alerts on Monday morning. The coldest air of the season is moving into the Northeast and a huge part of the U.S., including the Gulf Coast, after a snowstorm. At least 40 states, from Oregon to Florida and up to Maine, are on cold alerts on Monday morning. The inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump in Washington will be a cold one, the coldest since President Ronald Reagan's 1985 inauguration. That one also had to be pushed indoors due to brutal cold, with the temperature at noon at only 7 degrees with wind chills below zero. The forecast this year calls for temperature in the mid 20s with wind chills in the mid-teens, which isn't as cold as it was in 1985, but is about 15 degrees colder than normal for Washington, D.C. The cold expected on the East Coast is nothing compared to what people in the Upper Midwest are dealing with. Wind chills there are dipping as low as 40 to 50 degres below zero. The bitter cold has reached the Gulf Coast where freeze alerts are issued and temperatures could reach the lower 20s and even teens this week. The cold alerts follow a quickly moving little snowstorm that is done with, after most major cities from D.C. to NYC got just an inch or two. More fell inland. Terra Alta, West Virginia, got about a foot of snow, along with 12.5 inches in Grantsville, Maryland. Boston, Massachusetts, had 4 inches so far, while Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, got about 2 inches. Central Park in New York City saw about 1.6 inches and Washington, D.C., received less than a foot of snow ahead of Monday's inauguration. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Among the first executive orders set to be signed byPresident Donald Trumpwill be an order to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the newly named \"Gulf of America.\" The plan will be enacted \"a short time from now,\" Trump said during his inaugural address at the Capitol Rotunda on Monday. During his January press conference at Mar-a-Lago, Trump declaredhe would change the name, saying the gulf is currently run by cartels and that \"it’s ours.\" \"We're going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, which has a beautiful ring that covers a lot of territory, the Gulf of America,\" Trump said at the time. \"What a beautiful name. And it's appropriate. It's appropriate. And Mexico has to stop allowing millions of people to pour into our country.\" Presidents do have the authority to rename geographic regions and features, but it needs to be done via executive order. The U.S. Board of Geographic Names typically has the jurisdiction for geographic names. The Gulf of Mexico is one of the largest and most important bodies of water in North America. It's the ninth-largest body of water in the world and covers some 600,000 square miles. Half of the U.S. petroleum refining and natural gas processing capacity is located along the Gulf of Mexico, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and it supplies about 40% of the nation's seafood, according to the Environmental Defense Fund. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "\"Something needs to change,\" he posted on X. Elon Musk has objected to a lack of reciprocity in the US-China tech relationship, a rare criticism from the billionaire on issues sensitive to Beijing after US president-elect Donald Trump prepared to offer a reprieve to TikTok on a ban in the US. Musk, who has long sought to maintain close ties with Communist party officials in China, a core market and production centre for his electric-car company Tesla, has for years been careful in his statements about Beijing. But he said on Sunday that “something needs to change” after Trump said he would “most likely” extend a deadline for Chinese tech group ByteDance to divest from TikTok, which faced a ban under a US law that briefly forced it offline. Musk said that while he opposed banning the short-form video app on free-speech grounds, “the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but X is not allowed to operate in China, is unbalanced.” “Something needs to change,” he said in a post on X. Asked about Musk’s comments, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Monday that Beijing welcomed any company that abided by its laws and Chinese groups abroad were obliged to follow local rules. Responding to Trump’s proposal to push TikTok, which began restoring service in the US on Sunday, into a joint venture, Mao said Chinese groups should “decide independently” on operations and deals. Musk’s criticism was mild compared with some of his fierce attacks on western politicians and recent intrusions into the domestic politics of countries such as Germany, the UK and Italy. But it highlighted the Tesla chief’s potential conflicts of interest between protecting his business interests in China and serving as a confidant to the incoming president and a government efficiency tsar. Tesla earned almost a quarter of its sales in the third quarter from China and exported even more vehicles from its Shanghai plant to third countries. Some analysts believe Beijing is pinning its hopes on Musk as a potential intermediary with Trump, who has vowed to increase tariffs on imports from China. Chinese officials had previously discussed using Musk as a broker to resolve TikTok’s fate in the US. Musk on Sunday also met Chinese vice-president Han Zheng, who will represent President Xi Jinping at Trump’s inauguration. The presence of a Chinese official as senior as Han is unprecedented at US presidential inaugurations, where Beijing is normally represented by its ambassador in Washington. “Han met . . . Elon Musk, and welcomed US companies including Tesla to seize opportunities and share the fruits of China’s development,” China’s state-run news agency Xinhua reported. Han also met business leaders from the US-China Business Council and the US Chamber of Commerce on Sunday, as well as Trump’s incoming vice-president JD Vance. Han and Vance discussed the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl, which successive US administrations have pushed Beijing to crack down on, as well as regional stability and balancing trade, the Trump-Vance transition team said in a statement. US business leaders in the past have sought to play a moderating influence in often-volatile Sino-US relations, a role Beijing seems eager to encourage ahead of the second Trump administration. Han described US business as a “backbone” of relations between the countries, and urged businesses to “play an active role as a bridge” in US-China relations, Xinhua said. © 2025 The Financial Times Ltd.All rights reserved.

        "content": "Biden issued pardons to several family members Monday. President Joe Biden issued pardons to several close family members Monday inthe final minutes of his presidency. \"My family has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats, motivated solely by a desire to hurt me -- the worst kind of partisan politics,\" Biden wrote in a statement. \"Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe these attacks will end.\" \"That is why I am exercising my power under the Constitution to pardon James B. Biden, Sara Jones Biden, Valerie Biden Owens, John T. Owens, and Francis W. Biden,\" he continued. \"The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that they engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense.\" The five preemptive pardons were issued to James Biden, Joe's younger brother; Sara Jones Biden, James' wife; Valerie Biden Owens, Joe's younger sister; John T. Owens', Valerie's husband; and Francis W. Biden, Joe's younger brother. While he was sitting in the Capitol Rotunda attending the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, Biden announced the preemptive pardons for his siblings and in-laws. \"I believe in the rule of law, and I am optimistic that the strength of our legal institutions will ultimately prevail over politics. But baseless and politically motivated investigations wreak havoc on the lives, safety, and financial security of targeted individuals and their families. Even when individuals have done nothing wrong and will ultimately be exonerated, the mere fact of being investigated or prosecuted can irreparably damage their reputations and finance,\" Biden said. \"The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that they engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense,\" Biden said. This comes afterBiden issued a controversial pardonfor his son, Hunter Biden, in early December over tax evasion and federal gun charges. Biden had repeatedly said he did not plan to pardon Hunter. James Biden, 75, has especially come under fire from Republicans. Congressional Republicans have pressed the incoming Justice Department to bring charges against James Biden for allegedly lying to Congress as part of its impeachment inquiry into the outgoing president and his family. Paul Fishman, an attorney who represents James and Sara Biden, said in a statement to ABC News, \"Jim and Sara Biden did not seek this pardon because they have never committed any crimes. But for the reasons the President described, they have accepted it.\" James Comer, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, wrote to incoming Attorney General Pam Bondi on Friday seeking to hold James Biden accountable for \"having misled Congress regarding Joe Biden's participation in his family's influence peddling and deserving of prosecution under federal law.\" Comer and his Republican colleagues had already issued a criminal referral for James Biden to the Justice Department. Comer reacted to the preemptive pardons of Biden's family, saying they serve as \"a confession of their corruption.\" The pardon warrant, signed Jan. 19, excuses James Biden and the other family members of \"ANY NONVIOLENT OFFENSES against the United States which they may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014, through the date of this pardon.\" These were the second preemptive pardons issued by the outgoing president on Monday, not an unusual act for departing leaders. He also issued pardons to potential targets of the incoming Trump administration, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, retired Gen. Mark Milley and lawmakers who served on the House Jan. 6 committee. \"Our nation relies on dedicated, selfless public servants every day. They are the lifeblood of our democracy,\" Biden said in a statement. \"Yet alarmingly, public servants have been subjected to ongoing threats and intimidation for faithfully discharging their duties.\" ABC News' Alexandra Hutzler contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Aceasefire between Israel and Hamasin Gaza went into effect on Sunday morning.Hostages held in the stripand Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails will be freed in the first phase of the deal. Meanwhile, the November ceasefire in Lebanon is holding despite ongoing Israeli airstrikes on Hezbollah targets, which Israeli officials say are responses to ceasefire violations by the Iranian-backed militant group. Israeli forces also remain active inside the Syrian border region as victorious rebels there build a transitional government. Tensions remain high between Israel and Iran after tit-for-tat long-range strikes in recent months and threats of further military action from both sides. The IDF and the Yemeni Houthis also continue to exchange attacks. Yemen's Houthi rebels announced that they will limit their attacks in the Red Sea to only Israel-affiliated ships, signaling a temporary easing of their broader assault on commercial vessels.   The decision coincided with the ceasefire and hostage-release deal agreed between Israel and Hamas that went into effect on Sunday. The announcement was made via an email sent to shipping companies by the Houthi Humanitarian Operations Coordination Center, the Associated Press reported. Attacks on Israeli-linked vessels will end \"upon the full implementation of all phases\" of the ceasefire, the Houthis said, adding that attacks on U.S.- or U.K.-linked shipping may resume if the two nations continue airstrikes in Yemen. The Houthis have targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023, significantly affecting global shipping, particularly through Egypt's Suez Canal. The Houthis have also attacked American and allied military shipping in the region, plus launched drone and ballistic missile strikes into Israel. -ABC News' Somayeh Malekian The Palestinian Civil Defense in Gaza said there could be as many as 10,000 bodies buried under rubble all across the strip, as many displaced Gazans try to return to their homes under a nascent ceasefire agreement. The Civil Defense said in a post to Telegram that 10,000 missing people are believed to be \"under the rubble of destroyed homes, buildings and facilities.\" They are not counted in the 38,300 fatalities listed by the Civil Defense since Oct. 7, 2023.   The Gaza Ministry of Health -- which has separately tracked deaths during the conflict -- said on Sunday that 46,913 people had been killed in the Hamas-run territory during the war with Israel. The Civil Defense said Israeli forces prevented its crews from accessing large areas of the strip during the fighting, \"where there are hundreds of bodies\" that have not yet been recovered. The Civil Defense called for the entry of foreign rescue workers \"to support us in carrying out our duty to deal with the catastrophic reality left behind by the war, which exceeds the capacity of the civil defense apparatus in the Gaza Strip.\" The organization called on Gazans to assist rescuers \"with all necessary capabilities, including rescue, firefighting, and ambulance vehicles and equipment, as well as heavy machinery and equipment that will help us retrieve the bodies of martyrs from under the rubble of thousands of destroyed buildings and homes.\" Mandy Damari, the mother of Emily Damari -- who was among the three Israeli captives freed from Gaza on Sunday -- released a statement thanking all those involved in her daughter's release \"from the bottom of my heart.\"   \"Yesterday, I was finally able to give Emily the hug that I have been dreaming of,\" Mandy said in a statement shared by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters. \"I am relieved to report that after her release, Emily is doing much better than any of us could ever have anticipated,\" she added. \"In Emily's own words, she is the happiest girl in the world; she has her life back,\" Mandy said. \"In this incredibly happy moment for our family, we must also remember that 94 other hostages still remain,\" she added. \"The ceasefire must continue and every last hostage must be returned to their families.\" -ABC News' Anna Burd The International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement that Sunday's operation to collect three freed Israeli hostages from Gaza \"was complex, requiring rigorous security measures to minimize the risks to those involved.\"   \"Navigating large crowds and heightened emotions posed challenges during the transfers and in Gaza, ICRC teams had to manage the dangers posed by unexploded ordnances and destroyed infrastructure,\" the ICRC said in a Monday statement. \"More families are waiting anxiously for their loved ones to come home,\" ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric said. \"We call on all parties to continue to adhere to their commitments to ensure the next operations can take place safely.\" The ICRC also stressed that \"urgently needed humanitarian assistance must enter Gaza, where civilians have struggled for months to access food, drinkable water and shelter.\""

        "content": "Chief Justice John Roberts administered the oath of office. President Donald Trump did not place his hand on the Bible as he took the oath of office duringhis inaugurationon Monday. First lady Melania Trump stood next to the president holding two Bibles, but the 47th president of the United States didn't place his hand on either as he raised his right hand to take the presidential oath, which Chief Justice John Roberts issued. Melania Trump was holding her husband's personal Bible, which was given to him by his mother, and the Lincoln Bible that President Abraham Lincoln used to take the oath of office in 1861. There is no legal requirement for the president to place his hand on the Bible. According to Article VI, Clause 3, of the U.S. Constitution, which covers oaths of office, members of Congress, state legislatures, and executive and judicial officers throughout the country are bound \"by oath or affirmation\" to support the Constitution. \"But,\" it continues, \"no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.\" During his first inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017, Trump placed his right hand atop two Bibles held by the first lady as Roberts swore him in as the 45th president. Trump took the oath of office on Monday immediately after Vice President JD Vance was sworn in by Associate Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. As Vance took the oath of office, he placed his right hand on a Bible that was held by his wife, Usha Vance, as she also held one of their three children. During his presidential campaign,Trump endorsed the \"God Bless the USA Bible\"that, according to its website, was \"inspired by\" country singer Lee Greenwood's patriotic ballad. \"Happy Holy Week!

        "content": "The ceasefire will see Gaza hostages and Palestinian prisoners in Israel freed. Aceasefire between Israel and Hamasin Gaza went into effect on Sunday morning.Hostages held in the stripand Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails will be freed in the first phase of the deal. Meanwhile, the November ceasefire in Lebanon is holding despite ongoing Israeli airstrikes on Hezbollah targets, which Israeli officials say are responses to ceasefire violations by the Iranian-backed militant group. Israeli forces also remain active inside the Syrian border region as victorious rebels there build a transitional government. Tensions remain high between Israel and Iran after tit-for-tat long-range strikes in recent months and threats of further military action from both sides. The IDF and the Yemeni Houthis also continue to exchange attacks. The International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement that Sunday's operation to collect three freed Israeli hostages from Gaza \"was complex, requiring rigorous security measures to minimize the risks to those involved.\"   \"Navigating large crowds and heightened emotions posed challenges during the transfers and in Gaza, ICRC teams had to manage the dangers posed by unexploded ordnances and destroyed infrastructure,\" the ICRC said in a Monday statement. \"More families are waiting anxiously for their loved ones to come home,\" ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric said. \"We call on all parties to continue to adhere to their commitments to ensure the next operations can take place safely.\" The ICRC also stressed that \"urgently needed humanitarian assistance must enter Gaza, where civilians have struggled for months to access food, drinkable water and shelter.\" Tensions were high as people waited in Beitunia, in the West Bank, for the arrival of the 90 Palestinian prisoners who were released from Israeli custody just after 1 a.m. local time. Israeli forces used cars and tear gas to attempt to clear the roads, ABC News reporters on the scene said. ABC News' team saw flash bangs where people were gathered waiting for the prisoners’ release. Israeli Police did not immediately respond to ABC News’ request for comment on the matter.   The prisoners were released from Ofer Prison in Ramallah, West Bank, as a part of the hostage exchange and ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. People were seen on top of the buses waving flags and chanting as the prisoners arrived in Beitunia at approximately 1:42 a.m. -ABC News' Ellie Kaufman, as well as Tom Soufi Burridge and Hugo Leenhardt in the West Bank The 90 Palestinian prisoners that were in Israeli custody have been released, an Israeli prison service spokesperson said in a statement early Monday morning local time – about 80 minutes past the conclusion of Day 1 of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage exchange deal. There was no acknowledgement of the delay in the statement. However, it noted that the prison service was \"working to release the prisoners in accordance with the political outline that was agreed upon.\" The prisoners were transferred from “several prison facilities” to Ofer Prison in Ramallah in the West Bank. They were then released from Ofer Prison and the Jerusalem Detention Center, the spokesperson said. Buses with the prisoners have left the prison, a local source confirmed to ABC News. -ABC News' Ellie Kaufman, Anna Burd and Latifeh Abdellatif As the first day of a ceasefire and hostage exchange agreement between Israel and Hamas drew to a close, 90 Palestinian prisoners who were supposed to be released on Day 1 had not yet been released. The prisoners are being held in Ofer Prison in Ramallah, West Bank, where it is now in the earliest hours of Day 2. Although the agreement did begin a few hours later than expected on Sunday, there has been no official update from the Israel Prison Service — which is overseen by National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir — justifying the delay in the prisoners’ release. -ABC News' Ellie Kaufman and Matt Gutman"

        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "Summaries are often incorrect or strange; Apple is working on improvements. Apple released new beta versions of iOS 18.3 to developers and the public yesterday, and one of the changes coming with the new software update will (at least temporarily) disable Apple Intelligence notification summaries for all apps in the App Store's News and Entertainment category, at least temporarily. Apple saidearlier this monththat it would be instituting updates to how these notifications are handled after complaints from news organizations, and the company has apparently decided to turn them off entirely while it decides what those updates will look like. Most prominently, one user's notification summary from the BBC suggested that Luigi Mangione, the alleged killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had died of suicide; this was not true.Other exampleshave been cropping up since then. For the notification summaries that remain, Apple is instituting changes to make it clearer when users are reading summaries and to make it easier to turn those summaries off. Notification summaries in iOS 18.3 will be italicized to help further distinguish them from individual non-summarized notifications—before, there was a small icon next to the text to indicate you were looking at a summary. Apple is also making it possible to turn off summaries on a per-app basis directly from the lock screen without diving into the Settings app to do it. Inour own extensive testingwith Apple Intelligence notification summaries in iOS 18.1 and macOS 15.1, we observed many instances of summaries that were inaccurate or just plain weird. When you're just getting updates from your Discords or group text threads, errors tend to be pretty low-stakes, at least. But when you're getting notifications about war, murder, and politics, these kinds of errors have the potential to mislead and misinform. TheiOS 18.1and18.2 updates(along with iPadOS 18.2 and macOS Sequoia 15.2) enabled most of Apple's promised Intelligence features across all the hardware that supports them. For the iPhone, that's still only 2023's iPhone 15 Pro and 2024's iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro. The iOS 18.3 update is currently in its third beta release. The iOS 17.3, 16.3, and 15.3 updates have all been released in late January, so it's likely that we'll see the 18.3 update (and corresponding updates for iPadOS, macOS, and other Apple software) released at some point in the next few weeks.

        "title": "Hollywood mourns the loss of David Lynch",
        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "What better way to honor the visionary director than with a watchfest of some of his greatest work? Visionary filmmakerDavid Lynch—whose work spanned midnight movie staples likeEraserhead(1977), neo-noir psychological thrillers likeMulholland Drive(2001), and beyond—has diedat 78. According toDeadline Hollywood, the director had to evacuate his home due to the LA wildfires. He had been diagnosed with severe emphysema a few years ago and rarely left his house due to COVID-19 fears. Following the evacuation, his health deteriorated, and hediedat his daughter's house. “It is with deep regret that we, his family, announce the passing of the man and the artist, David Lynch,” the director's family saidin a statement. “We would appreciate some privacy at this time. There’s a big hole in the world now that he’s no longer with us. But, as he would say, ‘Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole.’ It’s a beautiful day with golden sunshine and blue skies all the way.” Reactionsfrom Hollywoodwere swift and heartfelt. Kyle MacLachlan, who became a star when Lynch cast him as Paul Atreides in 1984'sDune,Blue Velvet(1986), and the TV seriesTwin Peaks,described the directoras \"the most authentically alive person I'd ever met\": What I saw in him was an enigmatic and intuitive man with a creative ocean bursting inside him. He was in touch with something the rest of us wish we could get to... David was in tune with the universe and his own imagination on a level that seemed to be the best version of human. He was not interested in answers because he understood that questions are the drive that make us who we are. They are our breath... I will miss him more than the limits of my language can tell and my heart can bear. My world is that much fuller because I knew him and that much emptier now that he's gone. Lynch began making short films in the late 1960s and graduated from the American Film Institute in 1970. His first feature film was the cult classicEraserhead,and that early success led to the critically acclaimedThe Elephant Manin 1980. The verdict is more mixed on Lynch's adaptation ofDune;I personally found it unwatchable, but ithas its diehard fans. It was a box office bomb (although still the director's highest-grossing film), andLynch himself saidin an interview last June that it \"wasn't the film I wanted to make because I didn't have final say,\" adding, \"I died a death. And it was all my fault for not knowing to put that in the contract.” The success of Lynch's next film,Blue Velvet, helped assuage his disappointment, as did his move to television with the bizarrely surreal and influential seriesTwin Peaks—part detective story, part soap opera, with dashes of sci-fi and horror. The series spawned a spin-off prequel movie,Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me(1992), and a 2017 revival series,Twin Peaks: The Return,that picks up the storyline 25 years later. Many other TV series were influenced by Lynch's show, includingThe X-Files,Lost,The Sopranos,Bates Motel,Fargo,Riverdale,Atlanta, and the animated seriesGravity Falls. His final feature films were an LA-centric trilogy—Lost Highway(1997),Mulholland Drive, andInland Empire(2006)—and 1999's biographical road drama,The Straight Story, based on the true story of a man named Alvin Straight who drove across Iowa and Wisconsin on a lawn mower. It was acquired by Walt Disney Pictures and was Lynch's only G-rated film. The director'sfilmographyalso includes an assortment of short films, all bearing his eccentric stamp, including a surrealist short,Absurda, shown at Cannes in 2007, as well asPremonition Following an Evil Deed(NSFW YouTube link),Lynch's contribution to the 1995 anthology filmLumière and Company.All 41 featured directors used the originalCinématographecamera invented by theLumière brothers. Lynch was also an avid painter,cartoonist, and musician and directed several music videos for such artists as Moby and Nine Inch Nails. Until his death, he hosted quirky online \"weather reports\" and a web series,What Is David Lynch Working on Today? He even racked up the occasional acting credit. Lynch received an Honorary Oscar in 2000 for lifetime achievement at the Governors Awards after three prior nominations forThe Elephant Man,Blue Velvet, andMulholland Drive. Deadline's Pete Hammondcalled Lynch's speech\"probably one of the shortest for any Oscar acceptance.\" Lynch briefly thanked the Academy, the other honorees, wished everyone a great night, then pointed to the statuette and said, \"You have a very interesting figure. Good night.\" At Cannes, he won the Palme d'Or in 1990 forWild at Heartand won Best Director in 2001 forMulholland Drive. Naomi Watts, who played a dual role as doppelgängers Betty Elms and Diane Selwyn inMulholland Drive,said thatLynch put her \"on the map\" as an actor by casting her. “It wasn’t just his art that impacted me—his wisdom, humor, and love gave me a special sense of belief in myself I’d never accessed before,\" she said in a statement. \"Every moment together felt charged with a presence I’ve rarely seen or known. Probably because, yes, he seemed to live in an altered world, one that I feel beyond lucky to have been a small part of. And David invited all to glimpse into that world through his exquisite storytelling, which elevated cinema and inspired generations of filmmakers across the globe.\" \"I loved David’s films,” director Steven Spielbergsaid in a statement. “Blue Velvet,Mulholland DriveandElephant Mandefined him as a singular, visionary dreamer who directed films that felt handmade. I got to know David when he played John Ford inThe Fabelmans. Here was one of my heroes, David Lynch, playing one of my heroes. It was surreal and seemed like a scene out of one of David’s own movies. The world is going to miss such an original and unique voice. His films have already stood the test of time and they always will.” What better way to honor Lynch's passing than with a watchfest over the three-day weekend of our favorite Lynch creations? Credit:\n\n          \n          Libra Films How does one even begin to describe the surrealist oddity that is Lynch's first feature film? A young man named Henry (Jack Nance), living in a dank industrial neighborhood, finds out his girlfriend, Mary (Charlotte Stewart), is pregnant; when the baby is born, it is deformed with a snake-like face. Mary abandons them, and Henry, the reluctant father, begins experiencing strange visions about the Man in the Planet, a lady living in the radiator, and his own head popping off and being turned into erasers at a pencil factory. It's less a straightforward plot and more a collection of increasingly bizarre imagery. The finale combines sheer body horror with hints of sci-fi and the supernatural. Frankly, the film won't be to everyone's taste; at least one critic found the finale \"unwatchable\" when it was first released. But that boundary-pushing vision, plus Lynch's eerie black-and-white cinematography and ingenious sound design, combine to make it a cult favorite among film connoisseurs. Credit:\n\n          \n          Paramount Pictures Lynch kept the black-and-white cinematography for his next film,The Elephant Man, which was much more mainstream thanEraserhead, although it also deals with physical deformity—in this case, a tale loosely based on the late 19th-century life of John Merrick (John Hurt), a severely disfigured man with a skull so deformed that he would asphyxiate if he were to lie down. Merrick is forced to earn his keep as part of a Victorian freak show in London, where he is habitually abused and kept hooded by his \"owner.\" Merrick is rescued by a surgeon named Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins), who learns that Merrick is quite intelligent and makes him a permanent hospital resident, but Merrick still encounters those who see him as a horror. His climactic cry, \"I am not an animal! I am a human being! I am a man!\" before collapsing, is a cinematic moment for the ages. Both Hopkins and Hurt give exquisite performances, with Hurt's portrayal being all the more impressive because he had to do so through elaborate prosthetics and makeup. (There is now an Oscar for Best Make-Up because ofThe Elephant Man.) Credit:\n\n          \n          De Laurentiis Entertainment Group Blue Velvetcombines classic Hitchcockian elements with Lynch's distinctive visual style and edgy sensibility. A young man named Jeffrey (MacLachlan) finds a severed human ear on a lawn while visiting his ailing father and gets drawn into a mystery involving a sexy lounge singer named Dorothy (Isabella Rossellini) and an abusive drug-huffing gangster named Frank (Dennis Hopper), who keeps Dorothy as a sex slave after kidnapping her young son. He will also only drink Pabst Blue Ribbon beer. It's a frequently violent, disturbing, and unnerving film with overt sadomasochistic themes, but it's also a quite brilliant ode to 1950s film noir that has a way of getting under your skin. The scene where Frank’s creepy associate Ben (Dean Stockwell) lip-syncs to Roy Orbison’s “In Dreams,” while smearing lipstick on his face and kissing a restrained Jeffrey, is one that will linger well after the film's conclusion. Credit:\n\n          \n          Samuel Goldwyn Company[1] Based on Barry Gifford's novel of the same name,Wild at Heartis Lynch's take on the star-crossed lovers-on-the-run trope, weaving elements fromThe Wizard of Ozand the songs of Elvis Presley into Lula's (Laura Dern) and Sailor's (Nicolas Cage) bloody rampage across the country. They are fleeing a private detective and a hitman, both hired by Lula's mother, who objects to their relationship. While the film polarized viewers and critics upon its release, it has since become a critical favorite. Just how violent isWild at Heart? About 80 people walked out of a test screening during a graphic torture scene; 100 walked out during a second screening. Lynch realized the scene would kill his film, so he made some cuts to make it more palatable. He had to make further cuts to get a contractually obligated R-rating for the film's US release, using smoke to blur a moment where a character shoots off his own head with a shotgun. \"But that was part of whatWild at Heartwas really about,\" he later said. \"Really insane and sick and twisted stuff going on.\" As for Gifford, he thought Lynch's adaptation of his book was \"fantastic—it's like a big, dark, musical comedy.\" If that's your jam, this is the film for you. Credit:\n\n          \n          Universal Pictures Mulholland Driveis arguably Lynch's masterpiece, widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. It's certainly a compelling and singular film, with double doppelgängers and a dream-like plot so convoluted and ambiguous that the director included a card with the original DVD release outlining 10 \"clues\" to unlock his psychological thriller. Other than that, he steadfastly refused to offer any insight over the ensuing years into how the film's events should be interpreted. The film opens with a woman (Laura Harring) nearly being shot by her chauffeur on the titular Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles, saved when another car crashes into them. Having lost her memory, she takes refuge in an apartment and is befriended by its tenant, aspiring actress Betty (Naomi Watts). The two set out to discover who the woman is and why she has so much cash and a blue key in her purse. There are decomposing corpses, a lesbian sex scene, a bungling hitman, a director being threatened by mobsters, Spanish crooners in a venue called Club Silencio, and a heartbreaking finale. What does it all mean? Lynch is happy to let you speculate. Credit:\n\n          \n          ABC If you're feeling super ambitious, the long weekend is the perfect opportunity to bingeTwin Peaks. It begins with the discovery of a young woman's body on the beach, wrapped in plastic—high school homecoming queen Laura Palmer. FBI agent Dale Cooper (MacLachlan) comes to the quirky Pacific Northwest town to help solve the murder. It's the deftly drawn characters—who can forget the Log Lady (Catherine E. Coulson)?—and quirky local touches that make the show unique. It's all anchored by MacLachlan's wide-eyed appreciation of the region's Douglas firs, good coffee, and cherry pie—all dictated in great detail to his offscreen secretary, Diana. Sure, the acting is sometimes hilariously over the top—we're looking at you, Bobby (Dana Ashbrook)—but that was par for the course in nighttime soaps of that decade.Twin Peaks takes creative risks that defied conventional industry wisdom at the time, and the first season's short eight-episode run is more in keeping with today's streaming model. (The second season had the full 22 episodes typical of broadcast TV.) The unofficial third season,Twin Peaks: The Return, is even more strangely compelling, right down to the unforgettable finale.

        "content": "\"Classic\" plans without AI or price increases are only for current subscribers. Microsofthas two announcementsfor subscribers to its Microsoft 365 Personal and Family plans today. First, you're getting the Copilot-powered AI features that Microsoft has been rolling out to businesses and Copilot Pro subscribers, like summarizing or generating text in Word, drafting slideshows in PowerPoint based on a handful of criteria, or analyzing data in Excel. Second, you'll be paying more for the privilege of using those features, to the tune of an extra $3 a month or $30 a year. This raises the price of aMicrosoft 365 Personal subscriptionfrom $7 a month or $70 a year to $10 and $100; a family subscription goes from $10 a month or $100 a year to $13 a month or $130 a year. For current subscribers, these prices go into effect the next time your plan renews. Current subscribers are also being given an escape hatch \"for a limited time.\" \"Classic\" Personal and Family plans at the old prices with no Copilot features included will still be offered, but you'll need to go to the \"services & subscriptions\" page of your Microsoft account and attempt to cancel your existing subscription to be offered the discounted pricing. Microsoft hasn't said for how long this \"limited time\" offer will last, but presumably it will only last for a year or two to help ease the transition between the old pricing and the new pricing. New subscribers won't be offered the option to pay for the Classic plans. Subscribers on the Personal and Family plans can't use Copilot indiscriminately; they get 60 AI credits per month to use across all the Office apps, credits that can also be used to generate images or text in Windows apps like Designer, Paint, and Notepad. It's not clear how these will stack with the 15 credits that Microsoft offers for free for apps like Designer, or the 50 credits per month Microsoft is handing out forImage Cocreator in Paint. Those who want unlimited usage and access to the newest AI models are still asked topay $20 per month for a Copilot Pro subscription. As Microsoft notes, this is the first price increase it has ever implemented for the personal Microsoft 365 subscriptions in the US, which have stayed at the same levels since being introduced as Office 365over a decade ago.Pricing for the business plansand pricing in other countries has increased before. Pricing for Office Home 2024 ($150) and Office Home & Business 2024 ($250), which can't access Copilot or other Microsoft 365 features, is also the same as it was before.

        "source": "https://nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "Stunning discoveries and fresh breakthroughs in DNA analysis are changing our understanding of our own evolution and offering a new picture of the \"other humans\" that our ancestors met across Europe and Asia. Deep inside Cobra Cave, in the remote mountains of northeastern Laos, the beam from Eric Suzzoni’s headlamp bounced across barren rock until it flashed on something unusual: dozens of bones and teeth protruding from a layer of sediment and rock. Suzzoni, a tall, 50-year-old caving specialist with a tiger tattoo on his arm, yelled out to his partner, Sébastien Frangeul. This was the French explorers’ first foray into Cobra Cave. They had just scaled 65 feet of limestone cliff, ascending from the forest floor to the cave’s entrance with their unlikely companions: a pair of local teenagers in flip-flops. The Hmong boys knew the terrain around the cave and the namesake cobras that sometimes lurked inside. Today the snakes were nowhere to be seen. But soon after climbing into the cave, the explorers had stumbled upon what appeared to be a trove of ancient fossils. Suzzoni and Frangeul were scouting this cave for an international team of paleoanthropologists excavating sites nearby. For more than 15 years, the scientists had been digging in these mountains, searching for clues to some of the deepest mysteries of human evolution: When didHomo sapiensarrive here? And what other humans did they encounter? Suzzoni didn’t dare touch the fossils at first. But when he returned to survey the cave the next day with one of the research team’s geologists, his task was to pry loose a sample of the sediment from the cave wall. As he tapped on a chisel, a large brown tooth tumbled out, a molar thatlookedeerily human. Suzzoni hadn’t intended to make a find—by protocol and profession, that was the scientists’ job—but he marveled at the specimen for a moment and slipped it into his shirt pocket. It was, he says, “a beautiful gift.” (Tooth from mysterious human relative adds new wrinkles to their story.) Back at base camp, Suzzoni huddled with the research team’s leader, paleoanthropologist Fabrice Demeter with the University of Copenhagen, and Clément Zanolli, an expert in archaic teeth with the University of Bordeaux. Suzzoni carefully described what he’d seen up in Cobra Cave and showed them a few animal teeth he’d pulled from the sediment. Then he reached for his pocket. “Oh, I brought something for you,” Suzzoni said with a grin. Zanolli, wearing an Indiana Jones hat, leaned in for a close look. “The tooth was completely unworn, well-preserved,” he remembers. “I knew immediately that it was human.” But what kind of human? It was too big and rippled, he thought, to have come from a modernHomo sapiens.And though it superficially resembled a Neanderthal tooth, remains of that species had never been definitively identified in East Asia. The scientists exchanged baffled looks: Who was the owner of this mysterious tooth? A molar in Laos,a jawbone on the Tibetan Plateau, the fragment of a pinkie in Siberia. Our evolutionary history is now being rewritten by tiny discoveries illuminated by fast-advancing science—breakthroughs in ancient genetics, the study of proteins, and radioactive dating. The flood of new insights is not only radically changing the understanding of our origins; it is challenging the very notion of what it means to be human. All of us, all eight billion people on this planet, belong to a single species. WeHomo sapiensare the last hominins on Earth. Not long ago, it was widely believed that modern humans followed a relatively straight path of evolutionary progress as wefanned out of Africa, one that was separate from—and, implicitly, superior to—that of other species. Even today, one of the most indelible images of evolution is the so-called March of Progress, an illustration plastered on T-shirts and posters that shows our predecessors improving their posture as they progress inexorably toHomo sapiens,tall and proud, striding into the future. The current upheaval in evolutionary thinking has shattered that neat, linear view of human origins and begun to replace it with a far more tangled picture. What researchers now know is that between 70,000 and 40,000 years ago—a critical period in our evolutionary development—the world teemed with human variety. And asHomo sapiensradiated out across Europe and Asia, they encountered and at times even mated with other types of humans. Evidence of this commingling came in 2010, when Swedish paleogeneticist Svante Pääbo mapped the Neanderthal genome for the first time. His work proved that Neanderthals andHomo sapiensprocreated—and that the genetic exchange had profound and lasting consequences. Today, more than 40,000 years after the Neanderthals went extinct, most human beings alive carry remnants of their DNA. But who else shared the planet with us? And how did our interactions with these other humans shape the course of our own evolution and their extinction? Paleoanthropologists are delving ever deeper into these questions—the same ones that Demeter and Zanolli faced as they studied their mystery tooth from Cobra Cave. (Multiple lines of mysterious ancient humans interbred with us.) One of the most revealing clues came from a cave in Siberia, near Russia’s border with Kazakhstan, where researchers uncovered a pinkie fragment, no larger than a pea. The frigid temperatures in Denisova Cave had preserved ancient DNA in Neanderthal fossils discovered there. But this bone, more than 60,000 years old, was different. When Pääbo and his team analyzed its DNA, they came to a stunning realization: The fossil belonged to a completely unknown and vanished human species. The Denisovans, as Pääbo’s team dubbed them, became the first human group ever identified solely through DNA—a ghost species, as experts call those without a physical identity. Denisova Cave yielded more fossils with their DNA. These included a bone from a girl who had a Denisovan father and a Neanderthal mother—the only first-generation hybrid hominin ever discovered. (Did early humans interbreed with a ‘ghost’ population?) From the finger fragment, geneticists were able to trace Denisovan DNA in modern-day populations all over the world, from Iceland to Peru, with especially high concentrations in Papua New Guinea, 5,500 miles away from Denisova Cave.Homo sapiensalmost certainly interbred with Denisovans as well as Neanderthals and carried their DNA across the planet. Paleoanthropologists now believe these “gene-flow events” were not an anomaly but a central feature of evolution, helpingHomo sapiensadapt to new environments and leaving most of us with a direct biological link to extinct groups of ancient humans. For all the advances in genetic and protein research, understanding how Denisovan genes made it to Papua New Guinea or why Neanderthals and Denisovans, after nearly half a million years of existence, disappeared onceHomo sapiensarrived will require more fragments of ancient bones and teeth. After more than a century of digging, the fossil record of our best-known relative, Neanderthals, is comparatively sparse—bones from about 400 individuals. The Denisovan record is vanishingly small. All of the Denisovan fossils ever found could fit into a bread box, and there’d still be room for bagels. (Meet the Denisovans, the newest members of the human tree of life.) High on theTibetan Plateau in China’s Gansu Province—in a cave hollowed out of a cliff some 11,000 feet above sea level—a Buddhist prayer site has become a remarkable locus of scientific discovery. Long before the bones found there acquired value to modern researchers, they were ground to make medicines and elixirs. So it’s perhaps something of a miracle that an ancient jawbone found in Baishiya Karst Cave in 1980, now commonly known as the Xiahe mandible, still survives. The monk who discovered it brought the bone to his leader, the sixth Gung-Thang Living Buddha, who bequeathed it to Chinese scientists. The mandible sat on a shelf for years, unidentified and almost forgotten. But several years ago, inspired by the discoveries in Siberia, Lanzhou University archaeologist Dongju Zhang joined some colleagues in trying to solve the riddle of the bone’s identity. Then in her mid-30s—the bone had been languishing at the university for almost as long as she’d been alive—Zhang initiated a delicate excavation in Baishiya Karst Cave alongside the meditating monks. But obstacles abounded. The jawbone’s muddled oral history didn’t specify exactly where in the cave it had been found. Even more confounding: The jawbone had no trace of DNA. The only information came from the carbonate crust still clinging to it, which uranium-thorium dating estimated to be at least 160,000 years old. The jawbone was by far the earliest trace of human presence ever discovered on the Tibetan Plateau. Intriguing, yes, but it got Zhang no closer to identifying the fossil. On a work trip to Europe in mid-2016, Zhang, eager for help, met with a graduate student experimenting with a method of analysis that promised to go beyond DNA. Frido Welker was just 25, but he was already breaking new ground in a developing field, paleoproteomics, which functions like a deep-time machine. The tousle-haired Dutchman explained to Zhang how he analyzed ancient proteins that persist in fossils far longer than DNA—sometimes two million years longer. Proteins follow patterns set by DNA, so they act like shadow DNA, echoing information long after the original is gone. Still, Welker warned Zhang that extracting proteins is typically invasive—a hole must be drilled into the fossil—and there is no guarantee of success. “I felt a huge responsibility for this precious artifact,” Zhang recalls. “But we needed to find out what it was, and I was out of options.” Zhang’s last resort eventually became Welker’s first big chance, what he calls a “scientific opportunity” for his nascent field. The protein material was extracted in China—Zhang recalls how nervous she was handing over the mandible to be drilled—and Welker, now at the University of Copenhagen, then analyzed it with a mass spectrometer in a German lab. The patterns of the collagen protein found in the jawbone confirmed that the fossil was, in fact, Denisovan. The revelation marked the first time an ancient human had been identified solely through proteins. The jawbone, moreover, was the first evidence of Denisovans existing outside of Denisova Cave—enriching the picture of a species about which nearly nothing was known. The breakthroughs have continued, and the story of the Denisovans in the Tibetan Plateau cave has grown more detailed. A year after their discovery, Zhang and her team found traces of Denisovan DNA in Baishiya Karst Cave, further confirming their presence there. Last summer, Welker and his Chinese colleagues again used proteomics—and a Denisovan rib bone—to show that Denisovans had inhabited the cave off and on for more than 100,000 years, butchering and consuming a wide range of wild animals. “Adding a piece of the puzzle is a unique experience,” says Welker, “because every new piece changes the arrangement of all the rest.” Welker’s point, about how one discovery can change the meaning of another, is underscored by the jawbone that he and Zhang revealed. Their work identifying the mandible meant that Denisovans now had an “anchor point,” a bone that could serve as a basis of comparison for other fossils, whether found in a dusty Chinese collection or, say, in a cave in Laos. This is precisely what Fabrice Demeter needed. He’d been carrying around the mysterious molar from Cobra Cave, trying to find ways to extract information from it, but no viable DNA could be found in the tooth. Not even paleoproteomics could help, as the tooth’s proteins were too limited for a conclusive reading. The only thing Demeter could determine was that the tooth was human and belonged, 160 millennia ago, to a young girl. But when he learned that Zhang and Welker were set to publish a journal article unveiling the Denisovan jawbone, Demeter knew he and Zanolli, the tooth expert, could compare their molar with the two teeth on the jawbone. They discovered that one of the teeth was almost identical to the Cobra Cave molar. It was a morphological match, not an indisputable genetic one, but Demeter felt vindicated. “Maybe we had some luck,” he told me last year, as his team gathered at the Laos cave site. “But we’ve been digging here for 21 years! Now our work is finally paying off.” (Ancient teeth hint at mysterious human relative.) Cobra Cave marks the third place in the world where a Denisovan fossil has been found. It is also the first one discovered in a subtropical environment, about a thousand miles south of the high-altitude Baishiya Karst Cave on the Tibetan Plateau and 2,000 miles southeast of the frigid Denisova Cave, suggesting that Denisovans roamed widely and adapted to many different environments. As more Denisovan geographic markers are confirmed, and as their location and timeline continue to overlap with those of other hominins—in particular, Neanderthals andHomo sapiens—more genetic puzzle pieces fall into place. In 2014, five years before the Xiahe mandible was identified as Denisovan, population geneticist Emilia Huerta-Sánchez at Brown University made a surprising discovery about ancient DNA: She found that the gene known asEPAS1,which helps Tibetans live comfortably at high altitude without getting hypoxia, came not from modern humans but from Denisovans. (The pinkie from Denisova Cave gave her the only nearly perfect DNA match.) When Welker and Zhang confirmed in 2019 that Denisovans had inhabited the Tibetan Plateau, the connection made perfect sense. Tibetans put this gene to use, Huerta-Sánchez says, even though they carry only a small remnant of Denisovan DNA—and arrived on the plateau tens of thousands of years after the interbreeding took place. “You don’t need a lot of archaic DNA for it to be beneficial or useful later on,” says Huerta-Sánchez, who is now studying a Denisovan gene prevalent in the Americas. Even a small amount, she says, “has a huge impact on people, as it did with Tibetans.” The consequences of ancient interbreeding are still poorly understood. But geneticists like Huerta-Sánchez believe it served a vital evolutionary purpose. Not only did all that mating inject much needed genetic diversity intoHomo sapienspopulations. The gene flow gave modern humans evolutionary shortcuts to adapt more quickly to extreme environments: staving off hypoxia in Tibet, for example. This bolstering of the immune system likely helpedHomo sapiensspread across the world. But the impact hasn’t all been good. Scientists are finding that some of the genes inherited from Neanderthals and Denisovans are associated with depression, autism, or obesity. Interbreeding, moreover, didn’t seem to help the Neanderthals and Denisovans. Though remnants of their DNA live on within us, their genomes show no trace of modern humans—and some scientists believe that interbreeding withHomo sapiensmay even have hastened their demise. (DNA reveals first look at enigmatic human relative.) Ludovic Slimakis obsessed with the moment whenHomo sapiensmight have pushed other human species out of the evolutionary picture. The French paleoanthropologist with the University of Toulouse III has chased the ghosts of Neanderthals from the Horn of Africa to the Arctic Circle. For the past quarter century, he and his wife, archaeologist Laure Metz, have spent much of their time digging and thinking in Grotte Mandrin, a cave in southern France inhabited at different times more than 42,000 years ago byHomo sapiensand some of the last Neanderthals. It’s just a small rock overhang, but the human story it tells “is really universal,” says Slimak. “I use Neanderthals as a mirror to try to see ourselves more clearly.” Slimak, bearded and barefoot, is halfway through an animated soliloquy on the Neanderthal extinction when his seven-year-old son bursts into their 12th-century stone house in the foothills of the Pyrenees. “Papa, look what I found!” The boy drops a pile of bones onto the kitchen table. Slimak jumps up in delight to inspect the haul. The bones are the remains of a deer, and father and son piece them together into a skeleton. Slimak sees himself reflected in his son: “All my life I’ve been on a quest for our origins.” Slimak’s pursuit has led him to study the period whenHomo sapiensemerged from Africa, entering territory inhabited by Neanderthals, Denisovans, and other late hominins: the ghost species. This was a critical moment, the 52-year-old believes, when the last of these other humans were carrying out their own experiments in humanity—experiments that he strives to understand not just from a genetic perspective but from a behavioral one too. Scurrying around his office high in the rafters of his medieval home, Slimak shows me stone flints found in Grotte Mandrin. “When you take Neanderthal tools, each is unique,” he says, pointing out the variations in shape, color, and size. Living in small, isolated groups across Europe, Neanderthals displayed a creativity—and a sensitivity to their environment—quite unlike earlyHomo sapiens,whose tools and weapons were almost identical from the Levant to western Europe. Neanderthals, Slimak says, “perceived and engaged with the world in ways profoundly different from those ofHomo sapiens.” The discovery in Grotte Mandrin of one of the last Neanderthals in Europe has prompted Slimak, a National Geographic Explorer, to think deeply about how the divergent natures ofHomo sapiensand Neanderthals may have led to the latter’s ultimate demise. The skeleton, which Slimak named Thorin after the dwarf king in J.R.R. Tolkien’sThe Hobbit,was found a decade ago. Slimak’s team has been slowly unearthing it ever since, using tweezers to remove grains of sand and fragments of bone. After nine years, they’ve recovered parts of Thorin’s skull, 31 teeth, and a large number of tiny, unidentified bones. The root of one tooth still had viable DNA, which yielded an astonishing insight, just recently unveiled. Thorin’s group inhabited Grotte Mandrin about 42,000 years ago and had been in genetic isolation for the previous 50,000 years, never even mingling with other Neanderthals living a few valleys away. For Slimak, this was further evidence of a deeper Neanderthal lineage—and of how different Neanderthals were from modern humans. Slimak believes the moment when Neanderthals andHomo sapiensfinally encountered one another was a turning point in evolutionary history—and one captured on the walls of Grotte Mandrin. His colleague, archaeologist Ségolène Vandevelde, analyzed the soot deposits left by cooking fires on the cave walls—akin to counting the rings on a tree—and found that the last fire in the part of the cave once inhabited by Neanderthals occurred less than a year before the firstHomo sapiensfire. Whether there was an actual physical encounter or not, Slimak believes this moment, around 42,000 years ago, marked the point of no return. That the Neanderthals disappeared at the same time a wave ofHomo sapiensarrived was not, in Slimak’s words, “an unfortunate coincidence.” Paleoanthropologists have debated the causes of the Neanderthals’ extinction for years and will surely do so with Denisovans as their timeline and geographic spread become clearer. Denisovans and Neanderthals seem to have vanished from the fossil record at roughly the same time. There is a growing consensus among paleoanthropologists that the Neanderthals’ disappearance owed primarily to a demographic crisis—a dwindling population with limited genetic diversity—exacerbated by climate change and the emergence of a powerful rival,Homo sapiens.Interbreeding may have played a role too. Chris Stringer, a paleoanthropologist at the Natural History Museum in London and National Geographic Explorer, suggests that Neanderthal females may have been absorbed—or abducted—by dominantsapiensgroups, pushing Neanderthals to the edge of the demographic abyss. (Ancient DNA reveals new twists in Neanderthal migration.) The disappearance of the Neanderthals, Denisovans, and other groups around 40,000 years ago marked the end of millions of years when multiple groups of hominins walked the Earth. The current epoch is a historical anomaly, and Stringer advises us not to be smug in our status as the last ones standing. Neanderthals and Denisovans survived for half a million years;Homo erectuslasted nearly two million years. At the rate we’re going, how successful will we look in 2,000 years, much less a million? (How scientists bring ancient faces back to life.) As the sun sinks in the French sky, Slimak steps out into the garden, where his sons are jumping on a trampoline. His mind is still on the Neanderthals’ demise, which he chooses not to attribute primarily to a changing climate or demographic weakness.Homo sapienscaused Neanderthals to “vanish almost instantaneously from the annals of archaeology,” Slimak says. There’s no need to deny our colonialist guilt, he says, or to seek solace in the strands of Neanderthal DNA that live on inside us. Even after half a million years on the planet, the Neanderthals’ creativity and isolation didn’t stand a chance againstHomo sapiens’hyperefficiency and social networking. This was, he has said, “a fully fledged conquest.” Back in a rice fieldin northeastern Laos, Eric Suzzoni is leading Fabrice Demeter’s team of scientists toward a new cave several miles north of their base camp. For the past two decades, the international team has worked on a single mountain, excavating a cluster of caves that has yielded a rare trifecta of ancient human species: In addition to discovering the Denisovan molar, the team has unearthed fossils of ancientHomo sapiensin one cave and, in another, a 130,000-year-old tooth most likely fromHomo erectus.“That is an incredible result, but we’re also looking at just one site,” says Laura Shackelford, an American paleoanthropologist with the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and a National Geographic Explorer who began working with the team in Laos in 2008. Denisovan remains “have to be all over the place, and we just haven’t found them yet.” The future of the distant past seems to lie in Asia, a region that Demeter calls “a blank slate compared to Europe.” It started with the astonishing discovery of two diminutive “hobbit” populations—Homo floresiensisin Indonesia in 2003 andHomo luzonensisin the Philippines in 2019. But the focus has now shifted to China. Ever since the Xiahe mandible was identified in 2019, Chinese paleoanthropologists have raced to reexamine the country’s vast fossil collections—dusting off their “cold cases”—to see if they too might contain Denisovan relics. Two archaic jawbones—one dug up west of Beijing, the other dredged from the Taiwan Strait—are close physical matches with the mandible. If their identity is confirmed, as expected, it will mean that Denisovans ranged over all of mainland Asia—perhaps centering on what is now Chinese territory. Chinese researchers have begun to reshape long-standing assumptions about when we branched off from our fellow hominins. A recent phylogenetic study of one Chinese skull pushed back our divergence from Neanderthals and Denisovans by 300,000 years, shaking long-held beliefs about whether our common ancestor even lived in Africa. Then there’s the Harbin skull. Found in 1933 by a worker in northeastern China and hidden in a well for the rest of the 20th century, the 146,000-year-old fossil could belong to a hominin relative closer to modern humans than either Neanderthals or Denisovans—a tantalizing clue that inches us nearer to the identity of our common ancestor. Some scientists think the Harbin skull could represent a branch of the Denisovan family or even a completely different lineage. Local paleoanthropologists gave the lineage a distinctly Chinese label:Homo longi,or Dragon Man. (The Harbin skull was the basis for the model constructed by paleoartist John Gurche.) (‘Dragon Man’ skull may be new species, shaking up human family tree.) Over the past few years, Beijing has invested heavily in genetics and paleoproteomics labs—and in a new generation of scientists—to close the research gap with the West. Unlike Laos, China does not allow human fossils to leave the country for analysis, nor does it offer much access or transparency for foreign scientists. Many young Chinese scientists like Dongju Zhang, however, nurture a spirit of collaboration. Last summer, she invited a dozen foreign scientists, including Welker and Demeter, to western China for an international symposium on Denisovans. “We cannot work and publish alone,” Demeter says. “I need their help, and they need ours.” Venturing into the new Laotian cave—called Tam Neun—Suzzoni and the team of scientists entered the realm of the distant past. Time collapsed. And the remnants of ancient floods became apparent. Deep in the cave, geologist Philippe Duringer trained his headlamp on multiple thin layers of limestone encasing thick seams of sediment and rock, known as breccia. “That flowstone took thousands of years to form, but the sediment flooded in here in a single event, maybe in a single day,” he said. Near the back of the cave, tiny shadows appeared on the wall—silhouettes of bones and ancient teeth sticking out of the breccia, all entombed on that day more than 50,000 years ago. Suzzoni wriggled into the cave’s deepest chamber on his back, his face inches from the fossil-encrusted ceiling. Maybe, with a little luck, he would make another discovery that would change the map of human evolution.

        "content": "The seventh test flight of Starship is scheduled for launch Thursday afternoon. SpaceX plans to launch the seventh full-scale test flight of its massive Super Heavy booster and Starship rocket Thursday afternoon. It's the first of what might be a dozen or more demonstration flights this year as SpaceX tries new things with the most powerful rocket ever built. There are many things on SpaceX's Starship to-do list in 2025. They include debuting an upgraded, larger Starship, known as Version 2 or Block 2, on the test flight preparing to launch Thursday. The one-hour launch window opens at 5 pm EST (4 pm CST; 22:00 UTC) at SpaceX's launch base in South Texas. You can watch SpaceX's live webcast of the flighthere. SpaceX will again attempt to catch the rocket's Super Heavy booster—more than 20 stories tall and wider than a jumbo jet—back at the launch pad using mechanical arms, or \"chopsticks,\" mounted to the launch tower.Read moreabout the Starship Block 2 upgrades in our story from last week. You might think of next week's Starship test flight as an apéritif before the entrées to come. Ars recently spoke with Lisa Watson-Morgan, the NASA engineer overseeing the agency's contract with SpaceX to develop a modified version of Starship to land astronauts on the Moon. NASA has contracts with SpaceX worth more than $4 billion to develop and fly two Starship human landing missions under the umbrella of the agency's Artemis program to return humans to the Moon. We are publishing the entire interview with Watson-Morgan below, but first, let's assess what SpaceX might accomplish with Starship this year. There are many things to watch for on this test flight, including the deployment of 10 satellite simulators to test the ship's payload accommodations and the performance of a beefed-up heat shield as the vehicle blazes through the atmosphere for reentry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean. If this all works, SpaceX may try to launch a ship into low-Earth orbit on the eighth flight, expected to launch in the next couple of months. All of the Starship test flights to date have intentionally flown on suborbital trajectories, bringing the ship back toward reentry over the sea northwest of Australia after traveling halfway around the world. Then, there's an even bigger version of Starship called Block 3 that could begin flying before the end of the year. This version of the ship is the one that SpaceX will use to start experimenting with in-orbit refueling, according to Watson-Morgan. In order to test refueling, two Starships will dock together in orbit, allowing one vehicle to transfer super-cold methane and liquid oxygen into the other. Nothing like this on this scale has ever been attempted before. Future Starship missions to the Moon and Mars may require 10 or more tanker missions to gas up in low-Earth orbit. All of these missions will use different versions of the same basic Starship design: a human-rated lunar lander, a propellant depot, and a refueling tanker. Catching Starship back at its launch tower and demonstrating orbital propellant transfer are the two most significant milestones on SpaceX's roadmap for 2025. SpaceX officials have said they aim to fly as many as 25 Starship missions this year, allowing engineers to more rapidly iterate on the vehicle's design. SpaceX is constructing a second launch pad at its Starbase facility near Brownsville, Texas, to help speed up the launch cadence. Can SpaceX achieve this flight rate in 2025? Will faster Starship manufacturing and reusability help the company fly more often? Will SpaceX fly its first ship-to-ship propellant transfer demonstration this year? When will Starship begin launching large batches of new-generation Starlink Internet satellites? Licensing delays at the Federal Aviation Administration have been a thorn in SpaceX's side for the last couple of years. Will those go away under the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump,who counts SpaceX founder Elon Musk as a key adviser? And will SpaceX gain a larger role in NASA's Artemis lunar program? The Artemis program's architecture is sure to be reviewed by the Trump administration and the nominee for the agency's next administrator, billionaire businessman and astronaut Jared Isaacman. The very expensive Space Launch System rocket, developed by NASA with Boeing and other traditional aerospace contractors,might be canceled. NASA currently envisions the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft as the transportation system to ferry astronauts between Earth and the vicinity of the Moon, where crews would meet up with a landing vehicle provided by commercial partners SpaceX and Blue Origin. Watson-Morgan didn't have answers to all of these questions. Many of them are well outside of her purview as Human Landing System program manager, so Ars didn't ask. Instead, Ars discussed technical and schedule concerns with her during the half-hour interview. Here is one part of the discussion, lightly edited for clarity. Ars:What do you hope to see from Flight 7 of Starship? Lisa Watson-Morgan:One of the exciting parts of working with SpaceX are these test flights. They have a really fast turnaround, where they put in different lessons learned. I think you saw many of the flight objectives that they discussed from Flight 6, which was a great success. I think they mentioned different thermal testing experiments that they put on the ship in order to understand the different heating, the different loads on certain areas of the system. All that was really good with each one of those, in addition to how they configure the tiles. Then, from that, there'll be additional tests that they will put on Flight 7, so you kind of get this iterative improvement and learning that we’ll get to see in Flight 7. So Flight 7 is the first Version 2 of their ship set. When I say that, I mean the ship, the booster, all the systems associated with it. So, from that, it's really more just understanding how the system, how the flaps, how all of that interacts and works as they're coming back in. Hopefully we'll get to see some catches, that's always exciting. Ars:How did the in-space Raptor engine relight go on Flight 6 (on November 19)? Lisa Watson-Morgan:Beautifully. And that's something that's really important to us because when we're sitting on the Moon... well, actually, the whole path to the Moon as we are getting ready to land on the Moon, we'll perform a series of maneuvers, and the Raptors will have an environment that is very, very cold. To that, it's going to be important that they're able to relight for landing purposes. So that was a great first step towards that. In addition, after we land, clearly the Raptors will be off, and it will get very cold, and they will have to relight in a cold environment (to get off the Moon). So that's why that step was critical for the Human Landing System and NASA's return to the Moon. Ars:Which version of the ship is required for the propellant transfer demonstration, and what new features are on that version to enable this test? Lisa Watson-Morgan:We're looking forward to the Version 3, which is what's coming up later on, sometime in ’25, in the near term, because that's what we need for propellant transfer and the cryo fluid work that is also important to us... There are different systems in the V3 set that will help us with cryo fluid management. Obviously, with those, we have to have the couplers and the quick-disconnects in order for the two systems to have the right guidance, navigation, trajectory, all the control systems needed to hold their station-keeping in order to dock with each other, and then perform the fluid transfer. So all the fluid lines and all that's associated with that, those systems, which we have seen in tests and held pieces of when we've been working with them at their site, we'll get to see those actually in action on orbit. Ars:Have there been any ground tests of these systems, whether it’s fluid couplers or docking systems? Can you talk about some of the ground tests that have gone into this development? Lisa Watson-Morgan:Oh, absolutely. We’ve been working with them on ground tests for this past year. We've seen the ground testing and reviewed the data. Our team works with them on what we deem necessary for the various milestones. While the milestone contains proprietary (information), we work closely with them to ensure that it's going to meet the intent, safety-wise as well as technically, of what we're going to need to see. So they've done that. Even more exciting, they have recently shipped some of their docking systems to the Johnson Space Center for testing with the Orion Lockheed Martin docking system, and that's for Artemis III. Clearly, that's how we're going to receive the crew. So those are some exciting tests that we've been doing this past year as well that's not just focused on, say, the booster and the ship. There are a lot of crew systems that are being developed now. We're in work with them on how we're going to effectuate the crew manual control requirements that we have, so it's been a great balance to see what the crew needs, given the size of the ship. That's been a great set of work. We have crew office hours where the crew travels to Hawthorne [SpaceX headquarters in California] and works one-on-one with the different responsible engineers in the different technical disciplines to make sure that they understand not just little words on the paper from a requirement, but actually what this means, and then how systems can be operated. Ars:For the docking system, Orion uses the NASA Docking System, and SpaceX brings its own design to bear on Starship? Lisa Watson-Morgan:This is something that I think the Human Landing System has done exceptionally well. When we wrote our high-level set of requirements, we also wrote it with a bigger picture in mind—looked into the overall standards of how things are typically done, and we just said it has to be compliant with it. So it's a docking standard compliance, and SpaceX clearly meets that. They certainly do have the Dragon heritage, of course, with the International Space Station. So, because of that, we have high confidence that they're all going to work very well. Still, it's important to go ahead and perform the ground testing and get as much of that out of the way as we can. Ars:How far along is the development and design of the layout of the crew compartment at the top of Starship? Is it far along, or is it still in the conceptual phase? What can you say about that? Lisa Watson-Morgan:It’s much further along there. We’ve had our environmental control and life support systems, whether it's carbon dioxide monitoring fans to make sure the air is circulating properly. We’ve been in a lot of work with SpaceX on the temperature. It’s... a large area (for the crew). The seats, making sure that the crew seats and the loads on that are appropriate. For all of that work, as the analysis work has been performed, the NASA team is reviewing it. They had a mock-up, actually, of some of their life support systems even as far back as eight-plus months ago. So there's been a lot of progress on that. Ars:Is SpaceX planning to use a touchscreen design for crew displays and controls, like they do with the Dragon spacecraft? Lisa Watson-Morgan:We’re in talks about that, about what would be the best approach for the crew for the dynamic environment of landing. Ars:I can imagine it is a pretty dynamic environment with those Raptor engines firing. It’s almost like a launch in reverse. Lisa Watson-Morgan:Right. Those are some of the topics that get discussed in the crew office hours. That's why it's good to have the crew interacting directly, in addition to the different discipline leads, whether it's structural, mechanical, propulsion, to have all those folks talking guidance and having control to say, \"OK, well, when the system does this, here's the mode we expect to see. Here's the impact on the crew. And is this condition, or is the option space that we have on the table, appropriate for the next step, with respect to the displays.\" Ars:One of the big things SpaceX needs to prove out before going to the Moon with Starship is in-orbit propellant transfer. When do you see the ship-to-ship demonstration occurring? Lisa Watson-Morgan:I see it occurring in ’25. Ars:Anything more specific about the schedule for that? Lisa Watson-Morgan:That'd be a question for SpaceX because they do have a number of flights that they're performing commercially, for their maturity. We get the benefit of that. It's actually a great partnership. I'll tell you, it's really good working with them on this, but they'd have to answer that question. I do foresee it happening in ’25. Ars:What things do you need to see SpaceX accomplish before they're ready for the refueling demo? I'm thinking of things like the second launch tower, potentially. Do they need to demonstrate a ship catch or anything like that before going for orbital refueling? Lisa Watson-Morgan:I would say none of that's required. You just kind of get down to, what are the basics? What are the basics that you need? So you need to be able to launch rapidly off the same pad, even. They've shown they can launch and catch within a matter of minutes. So that is good confidence there. The catching is part of their reuse strategy, which is more of their commercial approach, and not a NASA requirement. NASA reaps the benefit of it by good pricing as a result of their commercial model, but it is not a requirement that we have. So they could theoretically use the same pad to perform the propellant transfer and the long-duration flight, because all it requires is two launches, really, within a specified time period to where the two systems can meet in a planned trajectory or orbit to do the propellant transfer. So they could launch the first one, and then within a week or two or three, depending on what the concept of operations was that we thought we could achieve at that time, and then have the propellant transfer demo occur that way. So you don't necessarily need two pads, but you do need more thermal characterization of the ship. I would say that is one of the areas (we need to see data on), and that is one of the reasons, I think, why they're working so diligently on that. Ars:You mentioned the long-duration flight demonstration. What does that entail? Lisa Watson-Morgan:The simple objectives are to launch two different tankers or Starships. The Starship will eventually be a crewed system. Clearly, the ones that we're talking about for the propellant transfer are not. It’s just to have the booster and Starship system launch, and within a few weeks, have another one launch, and have them rendezvous. They need to be able to find each other with their sensors. They need to be able to come close, very, very close, and they need to be able to dock together, connect, do the quick connect, and make sure they are able, then, to flow propellant and LOX (liquid oxygen) to another system. Then, we need to be able to measure the quantity of how much has gone over. And from that, then they need to safely undock and dispose. Ars:So the long-duration flight demonstration is just part of what SpaceX needs to do in order to be ready for the propellant transfer demonstration? Lisa Watson-Morgan:We call it long duration just because it's not a 45-minute or an hour flight. Long duration, obviously, that's a relative statement, but it's a system that can stay up long enough to be able to find another Starship and perform those maneuvers and flow of fuel and LOX. Ars:How much propellant will you transfer with this demonstration, and do you think you’ll get all the data you need in one demonstration, or will SpaceX need to try this several times? Lisa Watson-Morgan:That’s something you can ask SpaceX (about how much propellant will be transferred). Clearly, I know, but there’s some sensitivity there. You’ve seen our requirements in our initial solicitation. We have thresholds and goals, meaning we want you to at least do this, but more is better, and that's typically how we work almost everything. Working with commercial industry in these fixed-price contracts has worked exceptionally well, because when you have providers that are also wanting to explore commercially or trying to make a commercial system, they are interested in pushing more than what we would typically ask for, and so often we get that for an incredibly fair price.

        "content": "He spoke after taking the presidential oath for a second time at the Capitol. At noon today, Donald Trump took the presidential oath for a second time, capping a historic political comeback to the White House. As he did on the campaign trail, Trump painted a dark picture of America and took aim at President Joe Biden's leadership as his predecessor sat just steps away. \"My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal, and all of these many betrayals that have taken place, and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and indeed their freedom,\" Trump said, promising a \"golden age of America.\" The flag at the White House has been raised after Trump signed a proclamation for flags to be flown at full staff on all inauguration days.   The flag had been at half-staff following President Jimmy Carter’s death on Dec. 29. Trump is ordering the flag to return to half-staff on Tuesday for the remainder of the 30-day period, which began the day of 100-year-old Carter’s death. Last week, House Speaker Mike Johnson ordered that the flags at the Capitol be raised for the inauguration. -ABC News’ Justin Ryan Gomez With a flurry of executive orders expected today, President Donald Trump's top advisers, including his incoming Department of Justice leadership, are preparing for a storm of legal challenges to some of the most controversial ones. \"We're going to get sued on all of these things,\" one top Trump adviser said, adding that the volume of litigation is expected to be a full-time job for Trump's DOJ.   Trump has privately told advisers that he believes flooding the zone with executive orders will lead to lawsuits that may be less effective given the volume of actions he plans to take. During Trump's first administration, he faced upwards of 400 lawsuits challenging his actions. His advisers anticipate more than that this time. There will be a team inside the Justice Department that is dedicated just to defending Trump's actions in court, sources said. -ABC News’ Katherine Faulders Thetransition from the Biden White House to the Trump White Houseis well underway and crews are working quickly to make the changes before Trump arrives later this afternoon, but the choices are nearly identical to his first term.   In the Oval Office, gold curtains have returned behind the Resolute Desk, as well as the red-and-beige carpet with green leaves that covered the wood floor. As Trump sits at his desk, the portrait of President Andrew Jackson returned to the wall on his left side, just as it was during his first term. Biden had a portrait of Benjamin Franklin. To Trump’s right, where Biden hung a 1917 flag-decorated Childe Hassam painting, President Abraham Lincoln is now back on display. Other areas of the West Wing still need to be unboxed. In the Cabinet Room is a cardboard box with \"DJT Office Bibles\" written on the side. -ABC News’ Justin Ryan Gomez Members of Congress, officials joining the new administration and tech leaders including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg have congregated for an inauguration luncheon at the Capitol.           Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who chairs the Inaugural committee, is seated between Trump and Vance."

        "title": "These monkeys keep trying to mate with deer—scientists have a few theories why",
        "source": "https://nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "Two different groups of macaques have been spotted in Japan mounting sika deer. The behavior could be part of a shared “culture” between the animals. In 2015, on Japan’s forested island of Yakushima, a male macaque jumped up onto the back of a female sika deer and started trying to mate with it. At the time, researchers believed that the male’s low-ranking statusmight be driving the unusual behavior, perhaps serving as an outlet for having no breeding opportunities within his own species. In other words, it appeared to be a one-off encounter, which just so happened to have beencaught on camera. But then, in 2018, it happened again. Only this time, five female macaques were riding and rubbing male deer. What’s more, the behavior appeared in a totally new area—Minoh Quasi-National Park near Osaka, Japan, which is more than 370 miles away from Yakushima and across the Pacific Ocean. Meanwhile, back on Yakushima, researchers kept seeing the deer-mounting behavior in 2020, 2021, and 2023. Interestingly, some of the later incidents appeared to involve the same male that first initiated the behavior in 2015. Researchers identified the monkey based on his striking, almond-shaped eyes—though they can’t be absolutely certain it’s the same animal. “It’s difficult to recognize, but when you are a primatologist, you have to recognize each individual in the group,” saysCédric Sueur, a primatologist at the University of Strasbourg in France. However, if the animal truly is the same monkey, other monkeys in the troop may have learned deer-mounting from him,spreading the behavior through what’s known as social transmission, Sueur and his coauthors report in a study published this December in the journalCultural Science. “What is interesting is, maybe the first time the male did it was [due to] sexual frustration, so for one specific purpose,” says Sueur. But now that the male has ascended to a dominant rank and the females around him are doing it, too, “the behavior is changing over time,” says Sueur. “It’s becoming more complex.” (Macaques aren’t the only critters to ride other animals. See a weasel ride a woodpecker.) Putting the sexual advances aside for a moment, sika deer and macaques already have an interesting interspecies relationship. The deer follow the monkeys around, eating food they drop out of the trees, as well as nibbling on the monkeys’ feces. The macaques, in turn, munch on nutritious ticks and other parasites that they groom from the deer. This sort of exchange of services where both species benefit is what scientists call mutualism. Everything about the monkeys and deer acquiring food from each other fits the definition, saysJudith Bronstein, an evolutionary ecologist at the University of Arizona whostudies mutualismand was not involved in the new research. However, the mounting behavior seems like something else. “My guess is the deer are extremely socially tolerant of the macaques, because they’re picking the parasites off,” says Bronstein. And once the deer learned to tolerate one behavior, perhaps they started tolerating others, too. For instance, sometimes a monkey just seems to jump up onto the deer’s back and rest. When Sueur and his coauthors examined 45 video-recorded macaque-deer interactions in a second paper publishedin the journalPrimates, they found that most monkeys just sat on the deer. The team hypothesizes that one or both species may even enjoy the extra warmth of bodily contact. After all, macaques are already known to huddle together when it’s cold. “There are probably multiple benefits that they both receive from it,” says Bronstein. “I mean, there’s clearly a protection and nutritional exchange, just by the fact that the deer aren’t bolting when the macaques are around.” As Sueur and his colleagues looked for other possible explanations for mounting, the scientists ruled out the idea that the macaques might be using the deer for travel. The deer do sometimes move while the macaques are riding them, but the time spent traveling and the distance traveled weren’t statistically significant. The team couldn’t rule out one of the weirder hypotheses —that the deer may be acquiring regular nutrients by ingesting the male macaques’ ejaculate. But Bronstein is skeptical. “I think it’s probably just annoying, right? Some stuff is on their back, and they just get it off,” says Bronstein. “I think it’s meaningless.” (Why do some animals try to ride other animals?) While all of these interactions between the two species are scientifically interesting, they remain rare and hard to observe, which makes assigning meaning an even more difficult task. “The last time I went to Yakushima, I spent five days there,” says Sueur, “and I could observe it for only two seconds.” Still, the fact that the behavior is happening between both sexes and now in two separate locations suggests that the macaques and sika deer may be developing what the researchers call a “co-culture”. (Sueur and co-author Michale Huffman proposed the idea of co-culture in the journalTrends in Ecology&Evolutionin September 2024.) In animals, scientists use the wordcultureto describe behaviors that emerge in one or several populations, but not all of them. Some populations of chimpanzees fish for termites using sticks, while others have learned how to crack nuts with rocks, for instance. And different populations of humpback whales sing different songs. But with a co-culture, Sueur says two species must be evolving a suite of interacting behaviors at the same time. “In some other place, you will observe no interaction between deer and macaques,” he says. Bronstein finds the co-culture idea “really quite interesting.” However, as far as whether the deer-mounting behavior is spreading through social transmission, she says it will remain a hypothesis until the macaques can be identified with total certainty. “It’s reasonable. I mean, these are super smart individuals, and there are millions of cases known among primates of individuals adopting new behaviors from watching each other,” says Bronstein.

        "title": "What made these 1,300 strange circles at the bottom of the sea?",
        "source": "https://nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "When hundreds of eerily perfect circles were discovered on the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, theories abounded about what they could mean. Four years of underwater research revealed a lost world. On a bright, hot day in mid-September 2011, Marine biologist named Christine Pergent-Martini was hunkered down inside the cabin of a small research vessel, a 97-foot-long catamaran, cruising through the Mediterranean Sea about 12 miles off the coast of Corsica. Outside the ship’s windows, the sun glinted off the dark-blue water, but Pergent-Martini ignored the waves. She was more interested in what lay beneath them. A monitor in front of her displayed images from the vessel’s onboard sonar system, which was emitting a series of short acoustic pulses to reveal the underwater topography about 400 feet below. The ocean scientist was nearing the last day of a month-long mission: With a small crew, including her husband, oceanographer Gérard Pergent, and a graduate student from the University of Corsica Pasquale Paoli, Pergent-Martini had been mapping the seafloor in this region. The seemingly simple goal actually targeted one of oceanography’s major blind spots. The Mediterranean Sea covers about a million square miles, stretching from the Strait of Gibraltar in the west to Lebanon in the east. While its surface has been traversed since ancient times by everything from Greek triremes to Etruscan warships, its depths are mysterious to modern science. Much of its seafloor exists in something of a liminal zone: too shallow and close to the shore to draw interest from deep-sea mining companies but still too deep to be reachable by conventional scuba divers. Pergent-Martini and her colleagues wanted to learn more about what lived on the bottom at these depths. At first, the day was no different from any other. As the boat moved across the water, the scientists watched a series of predictable grainy black-and-white images appear on-screen: Sand. Small rocks. More sand. It was all stuff they’d seen before. But then something truly bizarre scrolled into view. A perfect circle, then another, then another. They were all about the same size—around 67 feet in diameter—with a distinct outline and striking symmetry. Weirder still, almost every ring had a dark spot directly in the center. They looked like fried eggs, Pergent-Martini thought, and there appeared to be several dozen of them. The scientists looked at each other. “We had no idea what it was,” Pergent-Martini says. Her team carefully logged their location and used a remotely operated vehicle to gather images. Still, the mystery only deepened. They captured video footage of the circles, but the view was too murky to confirm much more than the fact that this wasn’t sunken cargo. When the researchers presented their findings at a 2013 scientific meeting, they were still in search of answers about the nature of the rings. Even a follow-up study with a submarine in 2014 didn’t answer all their questions. In time, researchers would count more than 1,300 of these circles over a nearly six-square-mile area. After years of applying for grants to study the rings more closely, the Pergents reached a dead end. “It was very difficult to obtain money,” Pergent-Martini said. The Pergents are specialists in seagrass meadows, and this was a bit outside their focus. “We had no way to go farther.” Then, just the right person got in touch. In the world of undersea exploration, Laurent Ballesta is known for going to extremes. A photographer, marine biologist, technical diver, and National Geographic Explorer, he co-runs Andromède Océanologie, a company that leads scientific missions to document some of the world’s most inaccessible places. These undertakings often require specialized equipment and elaborate dive plans. In Antarctica, for instance, he once used a bespoke system of cables to photograph the underside of an iceberg. In South Africa he has explored deep underwater caves to capture images of rare coelacanths, which were thought to be extinct for millions of years before small, fragile populations were rediscovered. And in French Polynesia he’s used a customized rebreather system to stay underwater for 24 hours at a time to observe the hunting habits of gray reef sharks, as chronicled in a2018 story forNational Geographic. Ballesta and his team are always on the hunt for their next target. He also had a connection to the Pergents—he’d studied under them while working toward his master’s degree. So when he read his former teachers’ scientific paper about the mysterious pockmarked sonar scans, he was riveted. Some organisms have been known to grow in circular formations—corals make atolls, for example. But these rings repeated with an eerie regularity. (Scientists discover world’s largest coral—so big it can be seen from space.) “How is this possible?” he remembers thinking. Perhaps they were craters caused by erupting underwater vents or a strange geological formation. Pergent-Martini and her husband had a different hunch. Based on their submersible explorations, they believed the rings were coralline algae growing in a previously unknown shape. Another theory, put forth by some scientists, was that they were craters left by unused World War II bombs jettisoned by U.S. planes returning to their bases on Corsica. With the Pergents’ approval, Ballesta decided to pick up where they’d left off in hopes of solving the mystery, using their data to locate the rings. In July 2020, Ballesta and two other divers from Andromède Océanologie arrived above the rings in their own research vessel and donned scuba gear to descend into the abyss. While they quickly sank to the bottom, they stayed there only about 30 minutes because they had to account for at least several hours of decompression time on the way back to the surface. Equipped with a waterproof camera and lights, the team swam down through the bright upper waters of the ocean, the daylight gradually dimming to twilight. In less than two minutes they were approaching their destination, nearly 400 feet below the waves. “I stopped before I reached the bottom, some 20 or 30 meters up,” says Ballesta, “because I saw the rings.” They loomed out of the darkness, alien, enormous; they resembled gigantic platters etched onto the seafloor. After he snapped some photos, Ballesta dived to the bottom and approached one ring. At its center was a large knob made by red calcareous algae, measuring around three feet high and several feet across, with swaying fanlike growths atop it. The knob was surrounded by a vast wasteland of pale, scree-like debris. And slightly downhill, about 30 feet beyond the center, was the dark outer ring, a circular perimeter that appeared to be made up of rhodoliths, a collection of craggy, firm, pebble-size algae. Looking at the structure, Ballesta realized that the Pergents were right. “It was alive,” he says. (Sea creatures pollinate marine plants and algae, surprising scientists.) After 27 minutes on the bottom, Ballesta and his crew spent nearly five hours gradually rising to decompress safely, allowing their bodies to equalize to the shifting pressure. Long before he got back to the boat, Ballesta was convinced he had to return. “I didn’t need 27 minutes,” he says about his time on the seafloor. “After the first minute, I knew.” Julie Deter, a marine ecologist who was waiting for the team back on the ship deck, saw the excitement on their faces the moment they surfaced. Usually, by the time divers complete their long monotonous ascent, the thrill has faded. “But they were still very marked by what they had seen,” she says. There was still no explanation for why the rhodoliths would have formed such perfect circles so many times over. Ballesta decided he needed to spend more time among the rings, which would require a way to stay longer in the depths. In july 2021, Ballesta returned to the waters north of Corsica with three divers—Roberto Rinaldi, Thibault Rauby, and Antonin Guilbert—and a bold plan that would give them more time for exploration on the seafloor. They were inspired by divers on oil rigs who can quickly travel back and forth to the ocean bottom. At the surface, those rig divers live in sealed, pressurized chambers that match the conditions beneath the sea, where the pressure can increase by 10 or more times. They can then rapidly ascend and descend in a diving bell without having to slowly adjust to the change in pressure. (How billions of dollars and cutting-edge tech are revolutionizing ocean exploration.) Inside their own chamber at the surface, Ballesta and the others would live a bit like astronauts. Food would be passed in through an airlock. When they were ready to descend, they’d suit up and squeeze into the diving bell that would take them down to the seabed. The team had expected to spend three weeks exploring the rings and nearby reefs, but the weather turned against them. Heavy wind and waves rocked the boat, making leaving the chamber dangerous on several occasions. For multiple days, the four men were trapped, unable to see out of their increasingly humid chamber, which barely held their small beds and a dining table. Ballesta’s voice turns bitter as he recalls this period. Time for exploration was precious, and they were spending it reading novels. Finally the weather shifted, offering them the chance to drop down through the elevator chamber. “We found ourselves in another universe,” says Guilbert. This time, the crew could spend hours exploring it. All around, the divers marveled at the abundance of life. As they made more dives, when weather conditions allowed, they found rarely seen yellow corals in the deep canyons. There were also squat lobsters and colorful small fish hiding among pale pink gorgonians, the sort of fanlike soft corals that are usually seen in deep Mediterranean canyons. At one point Ballesta spotted a blue sea slug wandering about and took a photo. It was the first still photograph taken of this species by a diver. (These images will help you see coral reefs in a whole new way.) Ballesta invited the Pergents to monitor their progress aboard the support ship. “They looked very happy and touched that their discovery made this project happen,” he says. Because of the Pergents’ work, he and his colleagues were exploring a pristine and unusual ecosystem. But Ballesta knew this little universe was in a precarious position: It existed under shipping lanes, and commercial ships dropping anchor could pulverize everything. “Anchors can destroy all the rings very easily,” Ballesta says. The threat fueled a sense of urgency: The more they could learn about the rings, the better chance Ballesta might have of getting French authorities to protect them. Ballesta and his team made a total of six descents from their pressurized chamber to the rings. They focused their attention on drilling cores of the rings’ central knobs, which were then sent for carbon dating analysis. The hope was that knowing the rings’ age could help solve the mystery of what formed them and how. When the results came back, the team was shocked. The most ancient material, deep in the center of the knobs, was about 21,000 years old. For those who study climate history, that particular era represents a moment of profound planetary change. “It’s the last glacial maximum,” says paleoclimatologist Edouard Bard of the Collège de France, who organized the carbon dating. That was the peak of the last ice age. Back then, the Mediterranean was colder and far shallower, and the place where the rings are today would have been less than 65 feet from the surface, bathed in sunlight. In the summer of 2023, Ballesta returned to the rings, this time with a support vessel capable of launching two submarines to allow ocean and climate experts, including Bard, to make their own extended voyages into the ecosystem. The effort, which received funding from the National Geographic Society, was intended to form a scientifically rigorous hypothesis of exactly how the circles emerged. On one dive, Ballesta swam alongside the submersible as it scooted above the seabed. Acting as a tour guide, he showed the scientists inside various aspects of the rings and their surroundings. There were underwater caves nearby, set into a small cliff. The divers had found several caverns with layers of sediment that confirmed the area had once been situated above the ancient coastline—the voids may have been first cut through erosion as water washed against the cliffs some 21,000 years ago. Near the end of the trip, the scientists retreated to the ship’s cabin. Hooked up to the glitchy internet, Bard and the others were reading papers, looking at maps, thinking over what they’d seen. Slowly, over the next few months, they put together a hypothesis. Even though, to a nonexpert, the knobs in the center of the rings might look like coral, they were not. They were deposits formed by coralline algae, photosynthetic organisms that create skeletons made of calcium carbonate. During the last ice age, thousands of thesealgaecolonies likely took root on what was then a very sunny seafloor. For 3,000 years or so, these algae flourished, growing outward like domes or pancakes measuring several yards. Then, around 20,000 years ago, the world began to warm and continental ice sheets began to melt, funneling into the Mediterranean, which rose until the sun-loving algae were drowned in darkness. Their domes collapsed, leaving only the central knobs and bits of calcium carbonate scattered like bones from a carcass around them. For thousands of years, nothing lived amid the remains that left a permanent imprint. But about 8,000 years ago, the sea level stabilized. Deepwater algae laid down new layers on the central knobs, creating the film of life the divers saw. At the same time, rhodolith algae started to encase broken bits of calcium. The nuggets of algae rolled downhill from the knobs, settling around the base of the cones in perfect circles. That’s everyone’s best guess: The simple tug of gravity formed the rings. (We finally know what caused Florida fish to spin in circles until they died.) “We don’t have all the proof,” admits Ballesta. “But we have nothing to say our history is wrong.” Protecting the entire field of rings may prove difficult. Only about one-third of them lie within the Cap Corse and Agriate Marine Natural Park, a French marine protected area. But the park, with help from Ballesta’s Andromède Océanologie, is taking on this challenge. Using data from Ballesta’s dives, it plans to advocate for the further protection of all rings, even those located outside its bounds, in French and Italian waters. The park’s management council will propose prohibiting the anchoring of commercial vessels in the area. “Normally with this type of regulation, it takes years,” Ballesta says. But because so many of the rings already exist within a conservation zone, he’s optimistic. He’s also no longer thinking just about the rings but about what they represent. Traces like these—signs of the ancient coastline, including rings, submerged caves, and other mysterious structures—may be hidden all around the ocean floor. They are places for studying how the world is always building something new on the husk of a previous age. While there have been no sightings of the rings elsewhere, “you have to realize that explorations at this depth have been rare in the Mediterranean Sea,” Pergent-Martini says. “Perhaps there are others that have not yet been discovered.”  Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2025 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

That’s a shift from tradition, especially for a president who has characterized himself as achampion of the working class. Seats so close to the president are usually reserved for the president’s family, past presidents and other honored guests. Photos show the tech CEOs mingling with several of Trump’s picks for the Cabinet, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary and Marco Rubio as secretary of state. In one image, Rubio looks on from the background, facing a lineup of tech’s wealthiest leaders. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, stand beside Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and his fiancee, Lauren Sánchez, along with Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk, one of Trump’s closest advisers. The world’s wealthiest person, Musk also runs Tesla, SpaceX and the social platform X. Also at the Capitol for the day’s events were Apple CEO Tim Cook and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew. The mega-rich have long had a prominent role in national politics, and several billionaires helped bankroll the campaign of Trump’s Democratic opponent, Vice PresidentKamala Harris. Biden recently gave the Presidential Medal of Freedom toGeorge Soros, a billionaire donor to liberal causes.

        "content": "Physical proximity, social dominance are primary factors involved in \"contagious urination\" behavior. When ya gotta go, ya gotta go, and if it sometimes seems like the urge to pee seems more pressing when others nearby are letting loose—well, there's now a bit of science to back that up. It turns out that humans may not be the only species to experience \"contagious urination,\" according to anew paperpublished in the journal Current Biology. Chimpanzees living at the Kumamoto Sanctuary in Japan are also more likely to relieve themselves when others are doing so nearby, and the behavior seems to be hierarchical, \"flowing down\" from dominant chimps to more passive ones. “In humans, urinating together can be seen as a social phenomenon,”said coauthor Ena Onishiof Kyoto University. “An Italian proverb states, ‘Whoever doesn’t pee in company is either a thief or a spy’ (Chi non piscia in compagnia o è un ladro o è una spia), while in Japanese, the act of urinating with others is referred to as 'Tsureshon' (連れション). This behavior is represented in art across centuries and cultures and continues to appear in modern social contexts. Our research suggests that this phenomenon may have deep evolutionary roots.” Onishi, et al decided to study the phenomenon after noticing that many chimps in the sanctuary seemed to synchronize when they peed, and they wondered whether the phenomenon might be similar to how one person yawning can trigger others to follow suit—another \"semi-voluntary physiological behavior.\" There had been no prior research into contagious peeing. So they filmed the 20 captive chimps over 600 hours, documenting over 1,300 \"urination events.\" Those results supported the initial hypothesis that chimps tended to urinate in sync rather than randomly. Further analysis showed that the closer a chimp was to another peeing chimp, the more likely the probability of that chimp peeing as well—evidence of social contagion. Finally, Onishi et al. wanted to explore whether social relationships (like socially close pairs, evidenced by mutual grooming and similar behaviors) influenced contagious urination. The only social factor that proved relevant was dominance, with less-dominant chimps being more prone to contagious urination. There may still be other factors influencing the behavior, and more experimental research is needed on potential sensory cues and social triggers in order to identify possible underlying mechanisms for the phenomenon. Furthermore, this study was conducted with a captive chimp population; to better understand potential evolutionary roots, there should be research on wild chimp populations, looking at possible links between contagious urination and factors like ranging patterns, territory use, and so forth. “This was an unexpected and fascinating result, as it opens up multiple possibilities for interpretation,”said coauthor Shinya Yamamoto, also of Kyoto University. “For instance, it could reflect hidden leadership in synchronizing group activities, the reinforcement of social bonds, or attention bias among lower-ranking individuals. These findings raise intriguing questions about the social functions of this behavior.” DOI: Current Biology, 2025.10.1016/j.cub.2024.11.052(About DOIs).

The photo provided by the University of Alberta Meteorite Collection shows fragments collected from a meteorite which fell in front of a resident’s home in Marshfield, P.E.I., Canada, in July 2024. (University of Alberta Meteorite Collection/The Canadian Press via AP) NEW YORK (AP) — A doorbell camera on a Canadian home captured rare video and sound of ameteoritestriking Earth as it crashed into a couple’s walkway. When Laura Kelly and her partner returned home after an evening walk in July, they were surprised to find their walkway littered with dust andstrange debris, according to the Meteoritical Society, whichposted the video with its report. They checked their security camera and saw something slamming against their entranceway, producing a cloud of smoke and a crackle. The pair reported what they found to the University of Alberta’s Meteorite Reporting System and the curator, Chris Herd, examined samples of the debris to confirm its interstellar origins. Meteorites are bits of space rock that hit Earth after surviving a trip through its scorching atmosphere. About 48 tons (43,500 kilograms) of similar debris strikes Earth every day, according to NASA, but is much more likely to plunge into an ocean than onto someone’s front stoop. The space rocks also streak the night sky as shooting stars duringmeteor showerswhich happen several times a year. The footage is believed to be a first. While cameras have captured meteors streaking through the sky, it’s rare to capture the sound of a complete meteorite strike on video. The space rock, officially registered Monday, was named Charlottetown after the city on Prince Edward Island in eastern Canada where it struck. —- The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

It's easy to find a savings account with over 5% interest, which might not be as high as stock market returns but, with no risk involved, you can't beat it.\" While we evaluated the above institutions based on multiple criteria, the earnings potential of a savings account is often the key factor of concern. Below are some of the highest-yield savings accounts based on APY. Each account is backed by theFDICand insured up to $250,000 per depositor, per account, giving you peace of mind that your savings are protected no matter what. Note:APYs in our list below are updated daily but are subject to change. The Federal Reserve meets regularly to decide whether to raise or lower thefederal funds rate, which was just lowered from 5.25%–5.5% down to 4.75%–5.25% at the September 18 meeting. When the Fed rate is higher, borrowing money costs more, meaning taking out a loan and carrying credit card debt will be more expensive. However, high interest rates mean that banks offer better rates on savings products, including high-yield savings accounts and CDs. Now is a good time to put money into high-yield accounts, especially if they have fixed rates, as rates are likely to continue to drop. A savings account is a type of deposit account offered by banks, credit unions, and other types of financial institutions. Savings accounts allow you to keep your money on deposit in exchange for earning interest. The exact interest rate will depend on the financial institution and can range from 0.01% to upwards of 5%. Savings accounts are also a fairly liquid type of account, which means you can access your money just about as often as you want. Some banks may limit the number of withdrawals you can make in a month (typically, it’s six transactions per month), but you’re still able to exceed any withdrawal cap in place—you’ll just need to pay a fee on each additional transaction. Finally, savings accounts are considered one of the safest places to keep your money because unlike market investments, there is no risk to your principal deposit. Plus, your money is insured up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution, as long as your bank is backed by the FDIC (or the NCUA for credit unions). Finally, savings accounts are considered one of the safest places to keep your money because, unlike market investments, there is no risk to your principal deposit. Plus, your money is insured up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution as long as your bank is backed by the FDIC or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) for credit unions.  Before you open a savings account, it’s important to consider the pros and cons of putting your money in one. Of course, one of the biggest benefits of a savings account is that you can earn interest on your balance. The exact interest rate you receive may be higher or lower than the national average of 0.47% APY, but many of the high-yield accounts on our list have rates above 5.00%. You can also rest assured that your money is safe in a savings account. Unlike some types of investments, a savings account will never allow you to lose money. Plus, most high-yield accounts are insured by the FDIC orNCUAup to $250,000 per depositor, per institution in the event of abank failure. That said, there are some downsides to keeping your money in a savings account. For one, even high-yield savings accounts don’t offer the same level of earnings as investing your money in the market. However, all savings accounts are sensitive to market fluctuations, and the APY can go up or down at the discretion of your bank. You may also be limited in how many monthly withdrawals you can make. Your financial institution might charge a fee for each additional transaction over the limit. If you plan to open a new savings account, it’s important to review the fees associated with the account and any requirements that need to be met to avoid fees. These may include: Financial institutions set their savings account rates loosely based on thefederal funds rate. This is the interest rate that banks charge other banks to lend money overnight. When theFed raises its rates, this can increase the cost of borrowing and push banks to raise their APYs to attract new customers. The interest rate on a savings account is typically variable, meaning it can fluctuate over time. These rate changes are influenced by several factors, including monetary policy set by the Federal Reserve, general economic conditions, and competition among banks. It's a good practice to periodically check the interest rates of your savings accounts and compare them with rates offered by other institutions to ensure you’re maximizing your earnings. The national average savings account rate is 0.47%, so a rate above that benchmark would be considered above average. However, many banks offerhigh-yield savings accountswith as much as 4% to 5% APY. It pays to shop around to find the highest rates available if you’re looking for a new account. The interest rate on a savings account is essentially the base rate. The APY provides a more comprehensive view of your earnings by factoring in the effects of compounding and calculates how much you'll earn over the course of a year. To determine how much $1,000 will make in a savings account, you need to know the APY of the account and the length of time you plan to keep the money deposited. Additionally, the frequency of interest compounding (daily, monthly, or annually) can impact your final amount. For example, if you deposited $1,000 into a high-yield savings account that earns 5% APY and compounds annually,you’d have a total balance of about $1,050 at the end of one year (assuming you don’t make any more contributions). If the interest compounds daily, you’d have a bit more. If you deposited $10,000 into a savings account that earns 5% APY and compounds annually,you’d have a total balance of a little over $10,500 at the end of one year (assuming you don’t make any more contributions). If the interest compounds daily, you’d have $10,512.67. Choosing the right savings account requires careful consideration of your financial needs, preferences, and goals. Here are a few considerations to keep in mind as you shop around. While the absolute best APYs can generally be found at online banks and other institutions with lower overhead costs, many consumers prefer the ease and comfort of a large bank. Here are the APYs and minimum opening deposit requirements for several popular banks and credit unions: A savings account is an important tool that just about anyone should have as part of their larger financial plan. However, it isn't always the best place to put your money. There are other types of deposit accounts to consider as well: Ahigh-yield savings accountisn’t that much different from atraditional savings account. Both are deposit accounts offered by financial institutions that allow you to set aside money and earn interest on the balance. The primary difference is that a high-yield savings account offers a much higher APY on your funds than a typical savings account. Through the power ofcompound interest, you’ll earn interest on the principal balance and any interest you earned previously. That means you’ll essentially earn interest on your interest, allowing your savings to grow that much faster. A savings account is designed for storing money over a longer period and earning interest, which encourages saving. It may have limitations on the number of withdrawals or transfers per month. A checking account, on the other hand, is intended for managing daily transactions and offers more accessibility. It usually provides a debit card and check-writing capabilities and often has no limits on the number of transactions. However, checking accounts generally offer lower or no interest compared to savings accounts. Savings accounts and CDsare both savings vehicles that offer interest on your deposits. However, while savings accounts provide relatively easy access to funds with a variable interest rate, CDs lock in your money for a specified term (from a few months to several years) at a (usually) higher, fixed interest rate. Withdrawing funds from a CD before its maturity date typically incurs a penalty, which can reduce the earned interest. On the other hand, savings accounts may have limits on the number of monthly withdrawals, but offer more liquidity than CDs. When choosing between the two, it’s crucial to weigh the importance of access to funds against potentially higher fixed returns with CDs. Savings accounts work similarly to  toMMAsin that you’ll earn interest on your balance and can easily access your funds. While savings accounts focus primarily on providing a safe, liquid place to store cash, MMAs often combine the features of both savings and checking accounts, providing higher interest earnings and more flexible access to funds, such as through checks or debit cards. However, MMAs might require higher minimum balances to avoid fees or to earn the advertised rate. Overall, a savings account would be the best choice in situations where you prioritize earning some interest on your money while maintaining relatively easy access to the funds, without exposing the principal to market risk. When you’re ready to open an account, you’ll follow these general steps: To narrow down our top picks for the best high-yield savings accounts, the Fortune RecommendsTMteam evaluated more than 60 online savings accounts from a variety of traditional brick-and-mortar banks, online banks, and credit unions. All the accounts on our list are available to customers in the U.S. no matter where you’re located, subject to the terms of each account. The savings accounts on this list offer an APY at least 10 times the national average. We ranked each account in these core categories: The rates and fee structures for the accounts mentioned are available for limited periods, and APYs are subject to fluctuation, which could impact how much interest you earn. All the bank accounts and credit unions on this list are insured by the FDIC and NCUA, respectively. To open an account, financial institutions, including banks and credit unions, require a deposit of new money, so you may not be able to transfer money you already had in an account at that bank. Dig deeper:learn more about ourbanking methodology. In general, saving accounts are highly liquid accounts, meaning it's fast and easy to access your funds when needed. Federal law used to dictate that account holders could transfer funds out of their accounts up to six times per month. However, this rule was paused in 2020 and you can now make an unlimited number of transfers and withdrawals from savings accounts in many cases. However, some financial institutions still limit the number of withdrawals allowed per month and may impose a fee for excessive transactions. Savings accounts are generally safe, especially when they are held at banks that are insured by the FDIC or at credit unions insured by the NCUA. Both entities insure deposits up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution, for each account ownership category. The interest you earn in a savings account is usually subject to income tax. If you earn $10 or more in interest from a savings account in a year, the bank or financial institution will send you a Form 1099-INT, which reports the amount of interest you earned. Even if you don't receive a Form 1099-INT (e.g., if you earned less than $10), you're still generally required to report and pay tax on any interest income. If your goal is to keep cash safe for short-term needs or emergencies, a savings account is a good option since it offers easy access and security for your money. However, it may not give you the highest return on investment (ROI). CDs typically offer higher interest rates than savings accounts—however, your money is locked up until maturity, with penalties for early withdrawal. Savings accounts offer more flexibility to access funds anytime. For emergency savings or short-term goals, a high-yield savings account is usually better. For money you won't need for a while, aCD laddercan maximize returns while maintaining some liquidity. Consider your timeline and your need to access your funds when choosing between CDs and savings accounts. The \"best\" savings account depends on your specific needs, but some top contenders include LendingClub, Laurel Road, and UFB Direct. These institutions consistently offer high APYs and low fees. Compare a few options to see which features matter most to you.

The crime shocked Britain, and misinformation about the attacker sparked anti-immigrant violence across the country. The government announced it would hold an independent public inquiry into the attack, which was carried out by a U.K.-born teenager whose troubling fascination with violence saw him reported to authorities years before the crime. Axel Rudakubana, 18, entered the surprise guilty pleas as jury selection had been expected to begin at the start of his trial in Liverpool Crown Court. The July 29 stabbings led to a week ofwidespread riotingacross parts of England and Northern Ireland after the suspect wasfalsely identifiedas an asylum-seeker who had recently arrived in Britain by boat. He was born in Wales to Rwandan parents. Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomed Rudakubana’s conviction, but said it was “a moment of trauma for the nation.” “There are grave questions to answer as to how the state failed in its ultimate duty to protect these young girls,” he said. “Britain will rightly demand answers, and we will leave no stone unturned in that pursuit.” U.K. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said that a public inquiry would “get to the truth about what happened and what needs to change.”  She disclosed that Rudakubana had been referred to the government’s anti-extremism program, Prevent, when he was 13 and 14, and “was in contact with a range of different state agencies throughout his teenage years” — all of whom failed to spot the danger he posed. The attack occurred on the first day of summer vacation when the little girls at the Hart Space, a sanctuary hidden behind a row of houses, were in a class to learn yoga and dance to the songs ofTaylor Swift. What was supposed to be a day of joy turned to terror and heartbreak when Rudakubana, armed with a knife, intruded andbegan stabbing the girlsand their teacher in the seaside town of Southport in northwest England. AP correspondent Karen Chammas reports on a teenager in court for stabbing three girls in England, an attack that sparked riots. “This was an unspeakable attack — one which left an enduring mark on our community and the nation for its savagery and senselessness,” Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor Ursula Doyle said. “A day which should have been one of carefree innocence; of children enjoying a dance workshop and making friendship bracelets, became a scene of the darkest horror as Axel Rudakubana carried out his meticulously planned rampage.” Prosecutors haven’t said what they believe led Rudakubana — who was days shy of his 18th birthday — to commit the atrocities, but Doyle said that it was clear he had a “a sickening and sustained interest in death and violence.” Rudakubana had consistently refused to speak in court and did so once again when asked to identify himself at the start of the proceedings. But he broke his silence when he was read the 16-count indictment and asked to enter pleas, replying “guilty” to each charge. He pleaded guilty to three counts of murder, 10 counts of attempted murder, possession of a knife and additional charges related to possessing the poison ricin and for having an al-Qaida manual. Rudakubana faces life imprisonment when sentenced Thursday, Justice Julian Goose said. Defense lawyer Stanley Reiz said that he would present information to the judge about Rudakubana’s mental health that may be relevant to his sentence. The surviving victims and family members of those killed were absent in court, because they had expected to arrive Tuesday for opening statements. Goose asked the prosecutor to apologize on his behalf that they weren’t present to hear Rudakubana plead guilty. He pleaded guilty to murdering Alice Da Silva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6. Eight other girls, ranging in age from 7 to 13, were wounded, along with instructor Leanne Lucas and John Hayes, who worked in a business next door and intervened. Fifteen other girls, as young as 5, were at the class but uninjured. Hayes said he still had flashbacks to the attack and was “hugely upset at the time that I wasn’t able to do more.” “But I did what I could in the circumstances,” he told Sky News. “I’m grateful to be here, and by all accounts I’ll make a full recovery, at least physically. … I’m going to be OK and others won’t be, and that’s really where I I think the focus of attention should be.” Police said the stabbings weren’t classified as acts of terrorism because the motive wasn’t known. Matt Jukes, head of counterterrorism policing, said that an extensive investigation found Rudakubana had “a wide interest in conflict, violence, genocide, and terrorism,” but investigators were unable to figure out what drove him to kill. Several months after his arrest at the scene of the crime, Rudakubana was charged withadditional countsfor production of a biological toxin, ricin and possession of information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing to commit an act of terrorism for having the manual in a document on his computer. The day after the killings — and shortly after a peaceful vigil for the victims — a violent group attacked a mosque near the crime scene and pelted police officers with bricks and bottles and set fire to police vehicles. Rioting then spread to dozens of other towns over the next week when groups made up mostly of men mobilized by far-right activists on social media clashed with police during violent protests and attacked hotels housing migrants. More than 1,200 people were arrested for the disorder and hundreds have been sentenced to up to nine years in prison. Jill Lawless contributed to this report. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

        "content": "Darrin Bell won a major cartooning award in 2019. Late last year, California passed a law against the possession or distribution of child sex abuse material (CSAM) that has been generated by AI. The law went into effect on January 1, and Sacramento police announced yesterday that they have already arrested their first suspect—a 49-year-old Pulitzer-prize-winning cartoonist named Darrin Bell. The new law, whichyou can read here, declares that AI-generated CSAM is harmful, even without an actual victim. In part, says the law, this is because all kinds of CSAM can be used to groom children into thinking sexual activity with adults is normal. But the law singles out AI-generated CSAM for special criticism due to the way that generative AI systems work. \"The creation of CSAM using AI is inherently harmful to children because the machine-learning models utilized by AI have been trained on datasets containing thousands of depictions of known CSAM victims,\" it says, \"revictimizing these real children by using their likeness to generate AI CSAM images into perpetuity.\" The law defines \"artificial intelligence\" as \"an engineered or machine-based system that varies in its level of autonomy and that can, for explicit or implicit objectives, infer from the input it receives how to generate outputs that can influence physical or virtual environments.\" Acting on a tip from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Sacramento Valley Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force recently opened an investigation into 18 CSAM files being shared online. Further investigation revealed that the sharer was actually offering 134 CSAM videos, and police claim they were able to trace those files to the account of local resident and well-known cartoonist Darrin Bell. On Wednesday, police executed a warrant on Bell's home; they claim to have recovered \"evidence related to the case, as well as computer-generated/AI CSAM.\" Bell was arrested and is being held on $1 million bail. In a statement, police noted that \"this case was the first arrest by Sacramento Valley ICAC where possession of computer-generated/AI CSAM was charged against a suspect.\" Bell has long been a cartoonist. In 2019, hewon a Pulitzer prize\"for beautiful and daring editorial cartoons that took on issues affecting disenfranchised communities, calling out lies, hypocrisy and fraud in the political turmoil surrounding the Trump administration.\" According tolocal coverage of the case from NBC, Bell \"has said the goal of his work is for people to be more respectful of human dignity.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

        "title": "Life is thriving in the subsurface depths of Earth",
        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "Different species thrive beneath the oceans than under the land. From the flamboyant blossoms and birds of rainforests to the living rainbows of coral reefs, Earth’s surface is teeming with life. But some of its most diverse and fascinating biomes are thriving in the darkness below. We used to think that the subsurface was a far-from-ideal place for living things. Habitats that can soak up light and warmth from the Sun have the energy to sustain many forms of life and so were viewed as the most diverse. That view is now changing. Led by Emil Ruff of the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), Woods Hole, Mass., new research has unearthed communities of underground microbes that are almost as—and sometimes more—diverse than even reefs and rainforests. Ruff and his team found that subsurface bacteria and archaea are flourishing, even at depths where the energy supply is orders of magnitude lower than enjoyed by organisms in habitats that see the sun. “Subsurface ecosystems may host more than half of all microbial cells,” the researchers said in astudyrecently published in Science Advances. Microbes have adapted to survive just about everywhere. Starting in 2016, Ruff began collecting samples from surface and subsurface habitats all over the world for what would be the first global study to compare microbiomes above and beneath the surface. It is also one of the first to compare the composition and diversity in subsurface ecosystems below the land and ocean. Subsurface samples of bacteria and archaea (many of which could only be reached via mines or boreholes) came from rocks, aquifers, and deep sediments found in deserts, springs, the bottom of the ocean, and other habitats. Surface samples were taken from shallow sediments along with ocean and lake water. Also included were interface samples. Interfaces are environments right on the edge of surface and subsurface, such caves and hydrothermal vents, where organisms on the surface may be influenced by processes occurring in the subsurface, such as seepage, or vice versa. For the study, the diversity of bacteria and archaea of each individual sample was determined using DNA sequences, and the diversity found in all samples from a particular biome used to determine that biome’s total diversity. Marine and terrestrial habitats were compared, as well as surface and subsurface environments. It was the effort of almost a decade that unearthed some new details about subsurface life. So where were the most diverse bacterial and archaeal populations? The researchers discovered that “species richness and evenness in many subsurface environments rival those in surface environments,” as they said in the samestudy. At the level of individual samples, subsurface archaea were most diverse in brines, caves, cold seeps, springs, and the deep sea. Subsurface bacteria were most diverse in caves and marine sediments per sample. The total diversity of archaea was highest in marine subsurface and interface environments, while total bacterial diversity was also highest in interface environments. The archaea most abundant in the marine subsurface includeEuryarchaeotaandAsgararchaeota. Euryarchaeota tend to thrive in extreme heat and reduce carbon dioxide to generate methane. The methane output of other methanogenic archaea isalready being used as fuel, which is why such organisms can be especially useful. Asgararchaeota are the closest archaeal relatives of eukaryotes, or all organisms whose cells have a nucleus within a membrane, including us. There is special interest in studying asgararchaeota for more insight into how eukaryotic life evolved. Nitrospirotais an archaeal phylum that’s particularly common in the terrestrial subsurface. Some species of nitrospirota are capable of oxidizing ammonia, while others can reduce it to nitrite, which is used by phytoplankton and also defends against pathogens in the human stomach, mouth, and skin. Proteobacteriais a bacterial phylum that’s especially abundant in the terrestrial and marine subsurface. Some proteobacteria live in deep ocean trenches, and oxidize carbon monoxide (which contributes to global warming and depletes ozone). Bacteria also common in the marine subsurface includeDesulfobacteriaandMethylomirabilota. Desulfobacteria reduce sulfates, and other sulfate-reducing bacterias have already shown they can be used to help clean up contaminated soil. Methylomirabilota help control methane levels in the atmosphere by oxidizing methane. Something unexpected that caught Ruff’s attention was how total diversity went up with depth. This was surprising because less energy is available at deeper levels of the subsurface. For archaea, diversity went up with the increase in depth in terrestrial environments but not marine environments. The same happened with bacteria, except in marine instead of terrestrial environments. Much of what lies far below our feet still eludes us. Ruff suggests that single-cell microbes in even deeper, yet unexplored levels of the subsurface may have adapted to the absence of energy by slowing down their metabolisms so drastically that it could take decades, even centuries, for them to divide just once. If there really are microbes that manage to live longer than humans with this survival tactic, it is possible similar species might be hiding on planets such as Mars, where the surface has long been blasted by radiation. “Understanding deep life on Earth could be a model for discovering if there was life on Mars, and if it has survived,” Ruffsaidin a press release. Maybe future technology could retrieve samples several kilometers below the Martian surface. Until then, keep digging. Science Advances, 2024.

It’s one of the best places in the world to witness the red-hot spectacle of an active volcano, and it's been listed as mega-diverse for its ever-shifting landscapes, home to everything from stalking pumas lurking in the jungles of Petén to the emerald resplendent quetzal in the dense mountains of the north west. Travellers interested in history will find some of the largest and best-preserved Maya archaeological structures in the region, plus Indigenous communities and markets. The country’s relatively compact geography means much of this can be experienced on a single trip — here's how to make the most of it. Located at the geographical centre of the Maya world, Guatemala has more Maya ruins than any other country — tens of thousands of structures hidden in its jungle, many in the largest tract of American tropical forest north of the Amazon, an area known as Maya Biosphere Reserve. Most famous are those in the sprawling, UNESCO-listedTikal National Park, instantly recognisable for its 180ft Temple of the Great Jaguar. For travellers with time, lesser-known alternatives are just as captivating. North of Tikal, the ruined settlement of El Mirador is home to one of the tallest pyramids on Earth, a stone colossus that can only be reached via helicopter or a five-day hike. Research into how a civilisation could thrive so far from resources continues to redefine our understanding of the Maya genius. Today, some 40% of Guatemalans identify as Maya, the largest population in Central America. In highlands and villages, locals wear outfits handwoven using a backstrap loom, a centuries-old technique wherein the weaver attaches themself to the loom bar. Indigenous markets sell these colourful textiles and serve recipes passed down through generations, likepepian, a rich, spiced vegetable stew. For the largest indigenous market in Central America, head to the highland town of Chichicastenango, where thousands of sellers ply their wares every Thursday and Sunday, or consider San Francisco El Alto in Totonicapán. Wedged between tectonic plates, the west coast of Central America is crossed by a ridge of volcanoes like the spikes on a dragon’s back. There are 37 in Guatemala alone, three of which are active, making the country a hotspot for geotourism. Options range from moderate half-day hikes through lava fields and crater lakes to challenging multi-day adventures up the region’s highest peaks. The most jaw-dropping spectacle is near the UNESCO-listed city of Antigua Guatemala, where Volcán de Fuego, one of the world’s most active, shoots lava into the sky sometimes as often as every 15 minutes. More than just challenges to conquer, Guatemala’s volcanoes are intrinsic to the country and its people. They created natural defences during the Spanish conquest and the Civil War, and today, Maya descendants revere them as sacred, regarding their fiery peaks as gateways to the gods. Guatemala’s name originates from the Nahuatl (an Aztec language) wordQuauhtlemallan, meaning ‘place of many trees’. With a landscape rolling from the Atlantic to Pacific coastlines, encompassing volcanic peaks, cloud forests, lowland jungle and black-sand beaches, the country was recognised as mega-diverse at COP-10 in 2010. In the rainforests of the northern Petén region, howler monkeys roar from the canopy, their cries echoing along trails thick with twisting vines and towering ceiba trees. Scarlet macaws streak across the sky in flashes of red, while jaguars prowl silently in the shadows. The cooler air of the western highlands is perfect for resplendent quetzals, Guatemala’s national bird, their emerald feathers perfectly camouflaged in the forests. In the east, the Río Dulce, which carves its way to the Caribbean, is home to manatees. The cuisine in Guatemala has ancient roots and foreign influences. Staples include beans, chillies and corn, which the Maya believed the gods used to create the first humans. They’re transformed into dishes likekak’ik, a tangy turkey soup with samat (a wild coriander) and chillies, orchiles rellenos, chilli peppers stuffed with vegetables and beef, which was introduced by the Spanish. But a highlight for many visitors is tasting familiar favourites — coffee and chocolate, both made from beans grown on Guatemala’s volcanic, high altitude soil, which delivers depth and richness. Coffee is Guatemala’s leading export, celebrated for its bright acidity, notes of citrus and chocolate, and full-bodied finish. Cacao, meanwhile, was so important to the Maya, they used its beans as currency. Today, it’s eaten lightly sweetened and flavoured with vanilla, cinnamon or chilli. Pride runs deep in Guatemala’s villages and highlands, and community tourism offers travellers a chance to discover the country the authentic way — on its people’s own terms. A popular example is the town of Santa Catarina Palopó, by the shores of Lake Atitlán. Following a decline in traditional rural sources of income, families here joined forces to repaint their houses in vivid colours, actively drawing in a new wave of visitors. Their example is being followed across the country. At Laguna Brava, Guatemala’s second-largest lake mantle, remote Q’eqchi’ Maya communities invite visitors to explore turquoise cenotes and waterfalls while learning about their way of life. Further north in the Petén region, you can explore lesser-visited Maya ruins with an Indigenous archaeologist or go birdwatching with local guides who grew up hearing Guatemala’s dawn chorus every day.

        "title": "Trump executive actions on border, immigration: What to know",
        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "“This is about national security,\" said an incoming official. On a call with reporters onInauguration Daymorning, incoming White House officials previewed a series of executive orders and other actions they said the incoming Trump administration plans to take to address immigration and U.S. border issues. \"We will protect the American people against invasion,\" one of the incoming officials said during the call. \"This is about national security. This is about public safety. And this is about the victims of some of the most violent, abusive criminals we've seen enter our country in our lifetime. And it ends today.\" Many of the proposed executive orders revealed on Monday's call require help from international partners like Mexico and would almost certainly spark legal battles. Although one of the incoming officials said that the call would \"preview a series of actions to be taken today,\" it was not clear from the call, during which officials took very few questions from reporters, that everything about which they spoke would actually happen Monday. Here's a look at some of the promised executive actions: The incoming administration will be declaring a national emergency at the southern border. This will allow DoD to deploy armed forces to the region and free up resources to build a wall and other barriers there, as hepromised to doduring his first administration. \"What this action does is it deploys armed forces, erects physical barriers by directing DOD and DHS secretaries to finish the wall along the border, and allows for counter-UAS capabilities near the southern border in addition,\" an incoming White House official said. It's not totally clear what the official meant by \"counter-UAS capabilities,\" but it is important to note that since at least the Obama administration, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has used drones and other UAS (unmanned aircraft systems) to help conduct surveillance of the southwest border. The secretary of defense will be directed to deploy armed troops as well as the National Guard to the border, according to the call. In response to a follow-up question, an incoming White House official was unable to say how many troops will be deployed, responding that the decision \"is going to be up to the secretary of defense.\" This executive order aims to allow the military to \"prioritize our borders and territorial integrity,\" an incoming White House official said during the call. The official further said that the order will direct the military to plan operations to maintain territorial integrity by \"repelling forms of invasion including unlawful mass migration, narcotics trafficking, human smuggling and trafficking, and other criminal activities.\" In addition to creating federal and state partnerships to help enforce immigration policies and deportation priorities, this executive order would also aim to end the practice of \"catch and release,\" and mandates building a wall along the southern U.S. border. Though often used pejoratively, \"catch and release\" describes the practice of releasing undocumented immigrants after they've been processed at the U.S. border and while they await immigration hearings in court. The term originated during the George W. Bush administration and describes a practice that has been implemented during every administration since, including Donald Trump's first administration. Because it's logistically impossible to safely detain migrants indefinitely, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and other authorities release some migrants into the community to wait out their legal proceedings. Remain in Mexico is a policy implemented during the first Trump administration that required some asylum seekers to wait in Mexico, rather than in the U.S., as their petitions were processed in U.S. courts. This action would require Mexico's cooperation, which incoming White House officials did not address during Monday's call. Trump also promised during his first presidential campaign to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and signed an executive order to that end days after assuming office. Few new sections of barrier along the border were erected during his administration, though many sections of damaged or outdated barriers were repaired or replaced. The incoming administration will sign an executive order to designate drug cartels and other criminal organizations, including the U.S.-El Salvadoran-based MS-13 and Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, as foreign terrorist organizations orspecifically designated global terrorists(SDGT). An incoming White House official said Monday that the order will direct authorities to specifically remove members of Tren de Agua from the United States. And, citing theAlien Enemies Actenacted more than two centuries ago, the official said Tren de Agua has become an \"irregular armed force of Venezuela's government conducting a predatory incursion and invasion into the United States.\" The incoming White House official said the Trump administration is going to \"end asylum and close the border to illegals via proclamation.\" Essentially, this means undocumented migrants caught between ports of entry will not be able to claim asylum, which in turn will \"create an immediate removal process without possibility of asylum,\" the incoming official said. Like other executive orders announced Monday, this one would possibly face legal hurdles for several reasons. Current laws allow asylum seekers the ability to attempt to request asylum or protection once they enter the country, regardless of if they crossed between ports of entry. This has been the basis for several legal battles against some of the more recentasylum restrictionsthat the Biden administration implemented in June 2024. The incoming official said during Monday's call that the incoming Trump administration also plans to suspend refugee resettlements for at least four months. An incoming officials on Monday's call said \"We are then going to end birthright citizenship. This action gives effect to the phrase 'and subject to the jurisdiction thereof' in the 14th Amendment to clarify that … the federal government will not recognize automatic birthright citizenship for children of illegal aliens born in the United States.\" It was unclear from Monday's call whether ending birthright citizenship will be part of the day's announcements or will come later. Trump made thesame promiseduring his first term in office. The incoming official said Monday that the new administration is also going to \"enhance vetting and screening of illegal aliens\" and direct agencies to provide recommendations to the president for suspending entry for migrants from \"countries of particular concern.\" To help target gang members, criminals and other undocumented migrants, the new administration is planning to establish \"federal homeland security task forces\" so federal, state and local law enforcement can cooperate further in removing them. According to the incoming official, the new administration plans to \"restore the death penalty in public safety\" by directing the attorney general to seek capital punishment when an undocumented immigrant murders a law enforcement officer or commits other capital crimes. The new administration will also encourage state attorneys general and district attorneys to also pursue the death penalty in such cases, according to the incoming official. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "title": "These are the 10 best Hoka hiking shoes",
        "source": "https://nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "Our seasoned Hoka wearer breaks down the popular running shoe brand’s lineup for tackling all kinds of trails. With over a billion dollars in sales and many fans, there’s no question that Hoka is one of the most popular footwear brands out there. While they’re best known for running and walking shoes, Hoka also has several top-notch options for hikers, including the Anacapa and the Speedgoat for trail running. All feature Hoka’s signature cushioning, thoughtful designs, and top performance for tackling multiday treks or rocky trails. As a longtime travel writer, runner, and hiker, I’ve tried many of the brand’s styles—I eventested a pair of Clifton 9swhile training for a marathon and walking the Camino de Santiago in Spain. After careful research and consideration, I think the Kaha 3 Mid GTX is the best Hoka hiking shoe. This model is known for its comfort and stability on rugged adventures. But hikers have varying needs, and Hoka has many other equally great models. Here are all my top Hoka hiking picks. Have you noticed more Hoka shoes on the trail lately? That’s no coincidence. Known for its maximalist cushioning, Hoka has become a favorite not just among runners and walkers but also for hikers looking for comfort and performance. The best Hoka hiking shoes feature the brand’s signature cushioning plus good traction for navigating a variety of terrain. Why we like it:The Kaha 3 Mid GTX is an all-around great pair of hikers. Not only does this shoe have Hoka’s signature cushioning, but it also comes with Vibram Megagrip for reliable traction. Waterproof yet breathable—essential for multiday treks—this durable upper has an ergonomic design and a reinforced toe cap for protection from exposed tree roots or hidden rocks. “While they’re a bit heavier than other hiking shoes I’ve owned, you can’t beat their waterproofing, traction, and unmatched comfort,” says Joseph Burtoni, an avid hiker who has logged more than 600 miles in Kaha boots during his quest to visit all 63 of America’s national parks. Keep in mind:While the Kaha 3 Mid GTX offers all-day comfort, it comes at a price. The boot is heavier than other hiking boots, and some reviewers note the toe box feels smaller than previous iterations. Product details:Weight:20.0 oz. |Heel-to-toe drop:8mm |Stability:Neutral |Cushion:Plush |Materials:Waterproof nubuck leather and recycled polyester mesh upper, EVA midsole, Vibram Megagrip outsole |Sizes:7-15 (men), 5-15.5 (women) Why we like it:Designed for day hiking, the Anacapa 2 Low is lightweight and comfortable, thanks to the balanced cushioning. This waterproof yet breathable shoe comes with an abrasion-resistant toe cap. We also like that it’s made with the environment in mind, with a mix of recycled materials and Leather Working Group Gold-certified leather. Keep in mind:The Anacapa 2 Low can handle almost any kind of trail. However, some reviewers says it’s not the best for scrambling on steeper terrain with loose rocks. For those environments, you may want a shoe with a stiffer sole. Product details:Weight:12.4 oz. |Heel-to-toe drop:7mm |Stability:Neutral |Cushion:Balanced |Materials:Waterproof nubuck leather, EVA midsole, Vibram Megagrip outsole |Sizes:5-11 (These are the best women’s hiking shoes) Why we like it:This pair is especially great for hikers going on day trips or short backpacking trips. It’s versatile, comfortable, and breathable, even with Gore-Tex. As mentioned above, the Anacapa 2 Low GTX is made with lots of recycled materials and a Vibram Megagrip outsole for gripping slick surfaces. The extended Achilles tab gives hikers just a little bit of extra comfort. We also appreciate that this shoe has the American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA) seal of acceptance for promoting good foot health. Keep in mind:Some reviewers say the fit feels narrow, making it less ideal for hikers with wider feet. Product details:Weight:15.3 oz. |Heel-to-toe drop:8mm |Stability:Neutral |Cushion:Balanced |Materials:Waterproof nubuck leather, EVA midsole, Vibram Megagrip outsole |Sizes:7-15 Why we like it:Hoka’s Anacapa 2 Mid GTX features a high-top style that makes hiking in wet conditions a non-issue. Allie Cheney, a Colorado-based outdoor expert for Sun and Ski Sports, tested her Anacapa boots while “crossing rivers, puddles, trudging through mud, and facing a wide range of temperatures from 98°F to 50°F,” she says. In the end, she says the shoe’s waterproofing and breathability surprised her. The best part of these Hoka hiking shoes is that they’re lighter than many traditional waterproof hiking boots—ideal for day hikes and short backpacking trips. Plus, they’re made with some recycled materials and Leather Working Group Gold-certified leather. Keep in mind:Some hikers report a slightly snug fit, so you may want to size up. Additionally, while the Vibram outsole provides reliable traction on most terrain, it may be less effective in deep mud. Product details:Weight:18 oz. |Heel-to-toe drop:7mm |Stability:Neutral |Cushion:Balanced |Materials:Waterproof nubuck leather, EVA midsole, Vibram Megagrip outsole |Sizes:7-15 (men), 5-11 (women) (Here are 9 of the best Hoka running shoes) Why we like it:Although the Stinson 7 is technically a trail running shoe, it’s also one of Hoka’s best hiking shoes for flat feet because of the generous cushioning, wide toe box, and supportive arch design. Hoka’s “Active Foot Frame” technology helps create a “bucket seat” effect, which cradles the foot to help keep it stable. Additionally, the “H-Frame” sole helps support ankles, especially for those who overpronate. The breathable jacquard mesh upper adds ventilation, making this a great option for warmer days. Keep in mind:The Stinson 7 is not waterproof like most of the other hiking shoes on this list. Additionally, it may feel too wide for some hikers. Product details:Weight:12.9 oz. |Heel-to-toe drop:5mm |Stability:Stable |Cushion:Plush |Materials:Engineered jacquard mesh, H-Frame and Active Foot Frame technology midsole, multidirectional lug outsole |Sizes:7-15 (men), 5-11 (women) Why we like it:The qualities that make the Stinson 7 the best for flat feet also make it the best Hokas for stability. The broad base and Active Foot Frame technology work together to prevent lateral movement, reducing the risk of ankle rolls. The H-Frame sole, multidirectional lugs, and a stabilizing structure built into the midsole help secure your foot when you need to step laterally to avoid tree roots or walk uphill or downhill. These features are great for hikers who overpronate or carry heavier packs. Keep in mind:While the Stinson 7 is lighter than most other shoes on this list, it’s not the best option for trail running. For that, try the Speedgoat 6 (women’s;men’s), details below. Product details:Weight:12.9 oz. |Heel-to-toe drop:5mm |Stability:Stable |Cushion:Plush |Materials:Engineered jacquard mesh, H-Frame and Active Foot Frame technology midsole, multidirectional lug outsole |Sizes:7-15 (men), 5-11 (women) (Walk for hours with these top Hoka walking shoes) Why we like it:If comfort and cushioning are top priorities on the trail, the Hoka Kaha 2 Low GTX may be your best bet. The dual density compressed molded EVA midsoleand Hoka’s signature “MetaRocker” design make each step feel smooth and stable. With Hoka’s durable waterproof nubuck leather upper and a Gore-Tex membrane made from 71 percent recycled polyester, these shoes are designed to keep your feet dry and protected. The Vibram Megagrip outsole with its five-millimeter lugs, and you’ve got excellent traction for wet or uneven trails. Keep in mind:The thick leather upper and insulation may feel too warm in hot climates. Product details:Weight:16.8 oz. |Heel-to-toe drop:6mm |Stability:Neutral |Cushion:Plush |Materials:Waterproof nubuck leather, EVA midsole, Vibram Megagrip outsole |Sizes:3.5-14 (men), 5-15.5 (women) Why we like it:Hoka’s upgraded Transport Chukka GTX is the perfect mix of style and functionality. Features like the waterproof nubuck leather upper and breathable Gore-Tex membrane help keep feet dry whether you’re caught in a sudden rainstorm or tackling a muddy trail. The Vibram EcoStep outsole, made with 30 percent recycled rubber, grips well on everything from pavement to gravel. We love that the sleek chukka boot design looks polished enough for a day in the office or casual errands, but it’s also trail-ready. The engineered knit collar provides a snug, comfortable fit, and the quick-toggle laces make it easy to put these hikers on and take them off. The cushioning strikes the right balance between soft and supportive, making these comfortable enough for all-day wear. Keep in mind:While the Transport Chukka GTX is versatile, they’re better suited for easier trails. Product details:Weight:14.3 oz. |Heel-to-toe drop:5mm |Stability:Neutral |Cushion:Balanced |Materials:Waterproof nubuck leather upper, EVA midsole, Vibram EcoStep Recycled EVO outsole|Sizes:7-15 (men), 5-11 (women) (Here’s how the Hoka Clifton 9 held up on the Camino de Santiago) Why we like it:The Kaha 2 Frost GTX is made with 400 grams of PrimaLoft Gold insulation and an aluminum reflective foil sock liner made for warmth in temperatures as low as -25°F, according to the brand. The waterproof Gore-Tex membrane keeps snow, rain, or slush from seeping in, while the durable polyester ripstop mesh upper adds an extra layer of toughness. The Vibram Megagrip outsole has five-millimeter lugs for great traction on icy or uneven trails. Thoughtful features, like the glove-friendly top-hook lacing system and heel pull tab, make these boots a breeze to put on and adjust—even when it’s freezing outside. The Hubble heel’s unique shape offers extra padding at the back of the shoe, absorbing impact and helping you move more smoothly and steadily, especially on slippery or rough terrain. “It’s a really good winter hiking boot that keeps you comfortable all the way,” says Henricus Vogels, a Dutch trail runner and hiking content creator, who has tested this model in wet and muddy conditions. Keep in mind:The Kaha 2 Frost GTX’s heavier build and robust insulation are perfect for cold and wet conditions, but they may feel excessive in milder climates or shorter hikes. Product details:Weight:20.3 oz. |Heel-to-toe drop:8mm |Stability:Neutral |Cushion:Plush |Materials:waterproof Gore-Tex membrane, compressed molded EVA midsole, Vibram Megagrip outsole |Sizes:7-15 (men), 5-11 (women) Why we like it:The Hoka Hopara 2 is a hiking sandal designed for adventure around water. Its rugged construction includes a Cordura mesh upper for durability and quick drainage, while the EVA midsole balances cushioning with firm protection. The rubber toe cap offers great protection when you’re wading through streams, while the four-millimeter multidirectional lugs on the sticky rubber outsole help grip slippery surfaces. The Velcro heel strap offers a customized fit—a welcome update from the previous version of this hiking sandal. The roomy toe box adds comfort for long days on the trail. These sandals may not be the lightest hiking shoes, but we like that they’re built to handle everything from rocky trails to casual cruises. Keep in mind:The Hopara 2 can trap sand, which is difficult to remove. This Hoka model isn’t the best option for narrow feet. Product details:Weight:12.9 oz. |Heel-to-toe drop:6mm |Stability:Neutral |Cushion:Balanced |Materials:Cordura mesh upper, EVA midsole, rubber outsole |Sizes:7-14 (men), 5-11 (women) (From clothing to gear, here’s what you should wear hiking) Why we like it:The Hoka Speedgoat 6 is a versatile trail shoe for hikers who like to mix in some trail running. It’s lightweight and responsive, making hiking up steep trails or speeding through smoother paths comfortable. The Vibram Megagrip outsole has five-millimeter lugs for extra grippy traction on loose or uneven terrain. This updated version also introduces a more durable and breathable upper. Texas-based hiking coach Kristen Czudak credits the durable and lightweight design for helping conserve energy on her 24-mile rim-to-rim hike across the Grand Canyon and up Mount Whitney’s summit. Keep in mind:Some note that the Speedgoat 6 offers a more stable, yet less cushioned feel than the Speedgoat 5. Product details:Weight:9.8 oz. |Heel-to-toe drop:5mm |Stability:Neutral |Cushion:Balanced |Materials:Woven textile upper, compressed molded EVA midsole, Vibram Megagrip outsole |Sizes:7-15 (men), 5-12 (women) Why we like it:The Hoka Skyline-Float X is the only responsive hiking shoe in Hoka’s lineup. It’s got a dynamic ride that helps keep you energized on long hikes. The dual-density midsole and MetaRocker geometry provide a springy, forward-driving feel. That means the shoe absorbs the energy from each step and helps propel you into the next one. This quality, known as energy return, makes the Skyline-Float X a great choice for hikers who like to maintain a brisk pace or cover long distances without feeling weighted down. What’s unique about the Skyline-Float X is how it balances this responsiveness with stability and comfort. The shoe has a breathable upper and reliable grip from the Vibram EcoStep outsole. The high-stack midsole shields feet from rough trails while providing a firm, supportive platform that feels grounded. This combination can help reduce fatigue on extended hikes and makes the shoe suitable for carrying heavier backpacks. Keep in mind:At 14.9 ounces, the Skyline-Float X is heavier than other trail-running options like the Speedgoat 6 (women’s;men’s). Product details:Weight:14.9 oz. |Heel-to-toe drop:5mm |Stability:Neutral |Cushion:Responsive |Materials:jacquard engineered mesh, EVA midsole, Vibram XS Trek rubber outsole |Sizes:7-14 (men), 5-15 (women) In addition to my own experience as a heavy Hoka wearer, I chose the products in this story based on reviews by customers, experts, and avid hikers. I also analyzed the technical details, such as material quality and outsoles. • Third-party reviews:I sifted through reviews from trusted sources and hiking communities to learn how each shoe performs in real-world conditions. • Expert sources:I spoke with experts, including a board-certified podiatrist and outdoor specialists, to better understand the impact of features like cushioning, stability, and waterproofing on hiking performance and foot health. • Personal testing:Whenever possible, the experts and I tested the shoes, evaluating comfort, fit, and traction across different terrain. • Technical details:I compared the technical features that matter most to hikers, including waterproofing, weight, outsole material, and lug design. Uppers The material used in the upper part of a hiking shoe plays a big role in comfort, durability, and breathability. Waterproof uppers, such as those made with Gore-Tex, are ideal for wet conditions because they keep feet dry without trapping moisture. Breathable mesh uppers provide better airflow, making them great for warm or dry climates. For rugged terrain, durable materials like ripstop mesh or leather offer extra protection. Choose an upper material based on where you’re hiking. Lugs and traction Outsole lugs are key for how well hiking shoes grip the ground. Deep lugs provide excellent traction on rocky, muddy, or slippery surfaces, making them ideal for technical or challenging trails. Shallow lugs offer a smooth ride on pavement or hard-packed trails. Terrain and trails The condition of the trail will determine the type of features you need in a Hoka hiking shoe. Stability-focused shoes with features like reinforced midsoles or wide platforms are better for uneven, rocky, or steep trails. Lightweight and flexible designs are more suitable for smooth trails, short hikes, or multiuse environments. Matching a Hoka hiking shoe’s features to the terrain will help make hikes much more enjoyable. Gender neutral vs. gender-specific shoes Hoka offers both gender-specific and unisex models, but the difference is minimal. According to Hy Rosario, Hoka’s head of product for the outdoors, women-specific shoes often feature a slightly softer midsole and a narrower heel for a more tailored fit. Are Hoka hiking shoes true to size? Hoka hiking shoes generally fit true to size, but hikers should consider sizing up for longer treks to accommodate room for swelling. “It’s common for feet to swell due to prolonged activity, heat, and gravity,” saysSuzanne Fuchs, a board-certified sports medicine podiatrist practicing in Palm Beach, Florida. However, Fuchs cautions against having too much room. “It’s essential to ensure that the shoes still provide a snug fit in the heel and midfoot to prevent blisters and instability,” she says. What are the best Hoka hiking shoes for flat fleet? Generally, hikers with flat feet should look for shoes that provide “good arch support, a built-in arch, or the ability to accommodate custom orthotics,” says Fuchs, “as well as “stability features designed for motion control to help maintain alignment and support.” With its broad, stable base and built-in arch support, the Hoka Stinson 7 (women’s;men’s) is great for flat-foot hikers. This model also offers Hoka’s “H-frame” and “Active Foot Frame” technologies for stability. Are Hoka hiking shoes waterproof? Not all Hoka hiking shoes are waterproof. Models with “GTX” in their names, like theKaha 2 GTXor Anacapa 2 Mid GTX (women’s;men’s), mean they’re made with Gore-Tex waterproofing technology. How to break in hiking shoes properly? Fuchs recommends breaking in hiking shoes over time. “Start by wearing the shoes for short periods from one to two hours around the house or on flat surfaces,” she says. Once they feel more comfortable, you can increase the duration and intensity, such as short walks on uneven terrain. She also recommends wearing the same socks for your hikes for the best fit and to minimize hotspots.

        "content": "Wiki-style guide compiles all the pieces and potential of a rack you can carry. I have one standardrackappliance in my home: a Unifi Dream Machine Pro. It is mounted horizontally in a coat closet, putting it close to my home's fiber input and also incidentally keeping our jackets gently warm. I can fit juuuuuust about one more standard rack-size device in there (maybe a rack-mount UPS?) before I have to choose between outer-wear and overly ambitious networking. Were I starting over, I might think a bit more about scalability. Along those lines, technologist and YouTube maker Jeff Geerling has launched theProject Mini Rackpage for folks who have similarly server-sized ambitions, coupled with a lack of square footage. \"I mean, if you want to cosplay as a sysadmin, you need a rack, right?\" Geerling says inthe announcement video. It's a keen launching point for a new \"homelab\" or \"minilab\" project, also known as bringing the networking and hardware challenges of a commercial network deployment into your home for \"fun.\" It's a good time fall into the compact computing space. As Geerling notes ina blog postannouncing the project, there's a whole lot of small-form-factor PCs on the market. You can couple them with single-board computers, power-over-Ethernet devices, and network-accessible solid state drives that allow you to stuff a whole lab into a cube you can carry around in your hands. Geerling's guide aims to save everybody a whole lot of Reddit reading, question-asking, and blind-faith-buying as they get started or seek to expand their rack. Most 10-inch, or \"half-width\" racks (despite the \"standard\" rack being 19 inches wide) have only a few major manufacturers, and their availability varies by country. Each type of device that fits into the mini rack—power distribution units (PDUs), uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), HDD-sized shelves—gets linked by Geerling, along with important specs. There are also links to 3D-printable rack systems, cable management ideas (harder on a half-size setup than full), and showcases of mini racks of note. Geerling's page acknowledges the collective efforts of communities likeReddit's /r/minilabhave put into the burgeoning half-size market, long before his project. But seeking a central compendium, Geerling compiles gear, tips, and compatibility advice for mini-builds, along with ongoing discussions about the merits of individual components and broader build-out strategies. \"The community feedback around Project Mini Rack has been great so far,\" Geerling wrote in an email to Ars. The 3D-printed links and suggestions have been showing up steadily since he started committing to the page in earnest in mid-January. He's particularly excited to see that a \"LACK rack,\" or using IKEA shelving for budget rack mounting,can be downscaled to mini-rack size with an Edet cabinet. \"It's like someone at IKEA is a Homelab enthusiast,\" says Geerling. This post was updated to better define homelabs and minilabs. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

        "source": "https://mashable.com/",
        "content": "Australians know bloody good horror. The country's been an unsung hero of the genre for an age, most notably rising on the Ozploitation crest of the Australian New Wave in the '70s and '80s — after the R rating was introduced in Australia. (If you haven't seen the documentaryNot Quite Hollywood, do yourself a favour.) But even in the last few decades, it seems Australian filmmakers are intent on reminding horror fans of the country's screen legacy, with the likes ofTalk to Me,The Babadook,Lake Mungo, and more terrifying audiences with a uniquely Aussie flair. Beer-drenched psychological nightmares in Broken Hill, hauntings and possessions in suburban Adelaide, creature features that eat up stunning Top End cinematography, and found footage terrors under Sydney's CBD — there's a massive array of horror movies coming out of Australia, each more strange, disturbing, and innovative than the last. There are horror-comedies that blend zombies with Taylor Swift, monster movies that unpack generational trauma, and the beginning of one of the most successful (and most squirm-inducing) horror franchises of all time. Some of the best Australian horror films, including those of the Australian New Wave likeThe Devil's PlaygroundandLady Stay Dead, aren't currently streaming online; instead they're only available at film libraries or when shown at film festivals in one-offs. So we haven't included those here, even though they're absolute gems, and we'll keep updating this list. In the meantime, here, in no particular order, are 34 excellent Australian horror films that'll mess you up — and where you can watch them online (you might have to use a VPN for some of them). Before we start, I would like to acknowledge the Traditional Owners of the land on which these films were made. I would also like to pay my respects to Elders past and present. Sovereignty was never ceded. Small outback towns could have done withoutWake In Fright. Based on Kenneth Cook's novel, this defining 1971 Australian New Wave film is probably one of the first people think of when you say \"Australian horror\" (even if director Ted Kotcheff is Canadian). A deeply sinister tale of a teacher (Gary Bond) who finds himself in debt and spiraling in a booze-soaked town in rural New South Wales,Wake In Frightwould define the Australian landscape of horror in the '70s. Donald Pleasence is deeply unsettling as the menacing Clarence \"Doc\" Tydon, and the film's infamous kangaroo hunting scene is still controversial (real kangaroos were hunted and killed in this awful, frantically filmed sequence). Filmed on-location in Broken Hill, the small town and its surrounds become the stuff of nightmares thanks to Brian West's brazen cinematography, John Scott's maddening score, and Anthony Buckley's intentionally chaotic editing. And if you've ever wanted to ditch booze, this film might do it for you. How to watch:Wake In Frightisnow streaming on Plex in the U.S.; not currently streaming in the UK or Australia. If you're having a conversation about Australian horror movies andThe Babadookdoesn't come up, I'll eat my very tall, very creepy hat.Jennifer Kent's now-iconic feature debut, based on her 2005 shortMonster, this exceptional, terrifying film has become synonymous with modern Australian horror. An elegant, poignant, and frankly terrifying analysis of loss, not to mention one of themost impactful monster movies of the 2010s,The Babadookwill scare the hell out of you with its titular top-hatted creature — one who became anunofficial mascot of Prideoutside the film. Of course, Kent's next filmThe Nightingaleis another type of horror in itself. How to watch:The Babadookisnow streaming on Shudder in the U.S. and Australia, andon Netflix in the UK. Tony Williams' moody, haunting, 1982 psychological horror is an Australian cult classic for a reason. Jackie Kerin is marvellous as the pragmatic Linda Stevens, who inherits her late mother's stately retirement estate, Montclare, and the cast of lively senior characters within it. But there's something strange going on within the halls, and more than a few family secrets. It's got the essence ofThe Shiningwith its prolonged hallway meandering, disturbing surrealism, and bathroom-based horrors, and there's significant Hitchcock about it with all those dolly zooms. But the film will get under your skin with its own brand of horror; Gary Hansen's impeccable cinematography makes for a terrible feast (there's a slow motion hallway run with Kerin that is the stuff of legend) and Max Lemon's editing is unrelenting. Plus, a young John Jarratt (Wolf Creek) plays Linda's flame Barney, and he's a face that'll come up a lot in this list. How to watch:Next of Kinisnow streaming on Screambox via Prime Video in the U.S.andon Shudder in the UK and Australia. Teenagers carrying out rituals to contact the dead may have been done before, but YouTubers Danny and Michael Philippou (akaRackaRacka) put their own horrifying spin on the genre inTalk To Me. This Aussie shocker is a waking nightmare wherein a group of teens use an eerily lifelike hand statue to open a door to \"the other side\" — with serious consequences if they don't break their hold before 90 seconds has passed. \"In the end,Talk to Meis a terrifically scary horror movie, thanks to powerful performances, creepy creature designs, a splash of blood and gore, and practical effects that'll blow your mind and chill your spine. Like its sister in Sundance 2023's Midnight slate,Birth/Rebirth,Talk to Meis the rare horror trip that knows just when to end — with a wallop,\"writes Kristy Puchko in her Mashable review. \"If you're looking for some freaky frightening fun, be sure to reach out and touch this one.\"*— Sam Haysom, Deputy UK Editor How to watch:Talk to Meisnow streaming on Paramount+ via Prime Video in the U.S., andon Netflix in the UK and Australia. It's the legendary monster boar movie of the '80s with some of the best opening and ending sequences in creature feature horror. Based on Peter Brennan's 1981 novel,Razorbackis a surreal, tusked nightmare brought to life byHighlanderdirector Russell Mulcahy and written by Everett De Roche (Patrick/Roadgames). Set in the small New South Wales town of Gamulla, the film follows several people tormented by a massive razorback hog, primarily wisened boar hunter Jake Cullen (a sublime performance by Bill Kerr). When animal rights campaigner Beth Winters (Judy Morris) visits the town on assignment, she's not exactly welcomed by all the locals, some of whom make the titular beast seem like a fluffy toy. When Beth goes missing, the race is on for her husband Carl (Gregory Harrison) to find her in this dangerous landscape. Director of photography Dean Semler's post-Mad Max 2cinematography (including a POV boar cam) is perfection, Icehouse co-founder Iva Davies is behind the film's menacing score, and pre-The Matrixspecial effects designer Bob McCarron created one hell of a four-hoofed villain. Youhaveto see that ending. How to watch:Razorbackisnow available to rent/buy on Prime Video in the U.S. and the UK, and isstreaming on Shudder in Australia. This indie horror comedy directed by Abe Forsythe is one of the strangest on this list, and one of the most surprising. Here's the pitch: a school excursion to a small family fun park is disrupted by zombie mayhem, as the park i's conveniently located beside an inexplicable U.S. Army base doing dodgy tests on humans. Lupita Nyong'o is in the lead as a ukulele-playing kindergarten teacher, tasked with keeping her adorable class of pint-sized children uneaten and unaware of the danger they're in. But she's not alone, being accompanied by one of the kids' uncles, Dave (Alexander England), and a touring kids entertainer (Josh Gad). There's alotof cute musical numbers, Taylor Swift appreciation, and gruesome zombie moments — a zombie whose attempt to eat an echidna unscathed is a visual I will not forget soon. \"Going intoLittle Monsters, you might be expecting a fairly standard zom-com with an irreverent Antipodean twist and cute kids, likeShaun of the DeadmeetsBlack Sheeptinged withKindergarten Cop,\"wrote Mashable's former Australia Editor Caitlin Welsh in her review. \"What you actually get is an emotional trojan horse, drawing you in with goofy gore and familiar genre beats before hitting you with a surprisingly affecting story about how being responsible for small humans is actually scarier than any monster.\" How to watch:Little Monstersisnow streaming on Prime Video in the U.S.andon Now TV in the UK, and isavailable to rent/buy on Prime Video in Australia. A cult of vampires who believe drinking blood is \"the ultimate aristocratic act\" lies at the heart ofThirst, a 1979 gem. Directed by Rod Hardy and written by John Pinkney,, the film centres on Kate Davis (Chantal Contouri), whose family legacy sees her kidnapped into a rich commune, where they drive golf carts, ride in helicopters, and casually drink the blood of the living people trapped on their \"farm\". Kate tries to resist fate and shun the bloodthirsty call of the vampire, and Contouri gives an excellent performance, as Kate slips slowly into macabre madness through cold, scientific \"conditioning\".Thirstessentially uses the vampire genre to unpack unprocessed childhood trauma, and there's some excellent set pieces, including a cursed blood shower. Yes, there are some deeply unsexy sex scenes, but we'll forgive them. How to watch:Thirstisnow streaming on Tubi in the U.S.,on Shudder via Prime Video in the UK, andon Prime Video in Australia. One of the nastiest horror films of the 2000s,Wolf Creekhas become synonymous with modern Australian horror. When I first saw this film at the cinema at 17 in 2005, I wasn't really the same after it. Written and directed by Greg McLean, it smashed the box office, making$30 million globally with a $1 million budget. But it wasn't without controversy when it first released, as McLean based the screenplay and his villain on real murders by killersIvan MilatandBradley John Murdoch. Essentially, the film might make you never want to take a road trip again — though it strangelyboosted tourism. Backpackers Liz, Kristy, and Ben (Cassandra Magrath, Kestie Morassi, and Nathan Phillips) make an unknowingly perilous stop at Wolf Creek National Park en route to Cairns, where they're captured by cackling killer Mick Taylor (a now iconic performance by longtime horror actor John Jarratt — yes, he's in this one!). There's a sequel, a TV series, and plans for a third film, but this is the nightmare that started it all. How to watch:Wolf Creekisnow streaming on Tubi in the U.S.andon Stan in Australia, and isavailable to rent/buy on AppleTV+ in the UK. A terrifying 2008 gem of a film,Lake Mungois superb documentary-style psychological horror. Written and directed by Joel Anderson and told in docufiction style, the film centres around the mysterious drowning of Alice Palmer (Talia Zucker) in the small town of Ararat. Police videos, home movies, surveillance footage, news reports, and interviews with Alice's family and friends make up this deeply compelling film, which moves into potentially supernatural territory pretty damn quickly. The performances are so good you'll forget it's fiction and there's some pretty spooky footage on hand here. For Mashable, writer and editor Jenni MillerdescribedLake Mungoas a film that \"perfectly captures the everyday horrors of grief and the bone-deep sadness that lingers among the living. It's not fun per se, but it feels necessary — especially in a society in which we bury our grief along with the dead rather than grapple with the realities of loss.\" How to watch:Lake Mungoisnow streaming on Prime Video in the U.S.andon streaming on Shudder in the UK and Australia. Director Natalie Erika James explores the darkness of dementia and unprocessed trauma inRelic, a deeply unsettling and moving horror that uses the supernatural to examine Alzheimer's. Set in rural Victoria, the film sees protagonist Kay (Emily Mortimer) and her daughter Sam (Bella Heathcote) called to the remote home of Kay's mother, Edna (the legendary Robyn Nevin), who is in need of care. Darkness literally and metaphorically invades Edna's house as her mind deteriorates, becoming a haunting, sinister shell of memory and paranoia. With a moving and terrifying screenplay by James and Christian White, and tense cinematography from Charlie Sarroff,Relicmanages to visualise the fears of a changing mind. How to watch:Relicisnow streaming on Shudder in the U.S.,on BBC iPlayer in the UK, andon Stan in Australia. A nail-biter of a found footage horror that functions as a fictional documentary,The Tunnelis a deeply clever film that plays the long game — and it's somehow only 70 minutes. What begins as a team of investigative journalists led by Natasha Warner (Bel Deliá) digging into missing persons in disused tunnels under Sydney ends as a nightmare, with the production team building cold hard dread through reflective interviews, CCTV footage, and the crew's own terrifying, torch-lit filming. Directed by Carlo Ledesma, and written, edited, and produced by Enzo Tedeschi and Julian Harvey,The Tunnelfeatures tremendously convincing performances from Deliá, Steve Davis, Andy Rodoreda, and Luke Arnold. You'll dread every single turn of the camera, and Sasha Zastavnikovic's sound design is simply terrifying. The film was released in 2011 in cinemas, on DVD, on cable TV, and for free on BitTorrent simultaneously, with the filmmakers selling each frame of the film for $1 on a crowdfunding site. \"Yep, it was given away to watch and share for free online, making it probably one of the only films in history to be able to legitimately claim a piracy rate of zero,\"reads the film's still-live website. \"The end result was an explosion of viewership around the globe for the humble Australian film, amassing over 25M views and downloads across the internet.\" Plus this one gets points for being an Australian horror movie set in a city — it’s a rarity! How to watch:The Tunnelisnow streaming on Shudder. There are alotof croc movies out there (includingRogueup next), but don't discountBlack Wateron account of that. It's a brutal survival film written and directed by Andrew Traucki (who also didThe Reef) and David Nerlich. Relatively low budget with a tiny cast anddeeply convincing visual effects,Black Wateris sadly based on areal tragedy. In the film, Grace (Diana Glenn), her sister Lee (Maeve Dermody), and her husband Adam (Andy Rodoreda) take a sporadic boat tour through a mangrove swamp in northern Australia's crocodile country, and end up stuck in a tree being hunted by a colossal, calculating saltwater croc. The young cast do an impressive job with this situational nightmare, spending most of the film clinging to the mangrove branches, keeping their feet aloft, and coming to terms with dwindling hope. How to watch:Black Waterisstreaming on Hoopla in the U.S., isavailable to rent/buy on Amazon Prime in the UK, and isstreaming on Brollie in Australia. Filmed beforeBlack Waterwith a much bigger budget,Roguewas reportedly based on the same real events (and in this film, it feels like a very loose basis). Written, directed, and produced byWolf Creek's Greg McLean,Rogueis another type of beautifully-shot tourist nightmare, making it more of aJawsof the Top End — complete with a need for a bigger boat. A river tour finds themselves at the peril of a massive crocodile when they investigate a distress signal — it wasn't ideal for the Nostromo crew, and it's not ideal here. The cast does some serious work between escape attempts: Sam Worthington shines as the obnoxious but extremely useful Neil, Stephen Curry is a delight as a major camera show-off, John Jarratt (yep, he's here!) plays a grieving widower, a tiny Mia Wasikowska plays a teen with her parents, and Radha Mitchell plays their noble captain with her dog Kevin. But the lead, surprisingly, is Michael Vartan as an American travel writer looking for a big, sharp-toothed scoop. He finds it. How to watch:Rogueisnow streaming on Starz in the U.S.,on Freevee in the UK, andon Stan in Australia. If you like your horror lean and mean, you must see this '70s-set indie from Australian writers/directors Cameron Cairnes and Colin Cairnes (aka the Cairnes Brothers). David Dastmalchian,a character actor who's unnerved us inThe BoogeymanandPrisoners,headlines here as Jack Delroy, a talk show host who is so determined to best Johnny Carson's ratings that he invites an allegedly possessed girl to be a guest on his Halloween special. Part showbiz satire, part found-footage horror,Late Night with the Deviluses a low-fi look and keenly creepy effects to create a throwback tale of terror that is rank with fresh blood. While the film's been criticized forits use of AI, its scares are so satisfying that it earned praise from none other than the master of horror himself,Stephen King. So, take a cue fromour review: \"Tune in and hang on. Dastmalchian and his demon are coming for you.\"*—Kristy Puchko, Entertainment Editor How to watch:Late Night with the Devilisnow streaming on Hulu in the U.S.andon Shudder in the UK and Australia. While theSawseries has become synonymous with the torture porn variety of horror (not really my cup of tea), the original film is a superb, deeply cruel puzzle wrapped in a serial killer mystery inside the most horrible bathroom of cinema. It's another film I was rattled by as a teenager, in 2006, and would never really see horror the same way afterwards. The concept is simple: two men (played bySawfilmmaker Leigh Whannell and Cary Elwes) wake up shackled in said decrepit room with nothing but their wits and a rusty hacksaw. Unimaginable decisions must be made to survive this \"game\" created by sadistic serial killer John \"Jigsaw\" Kramer (Tobin Bell). Filmmakers James Wan and Whannell infamously tried to get funding for the originalSawin Australia, then took it to the U.S. after no Aussie studios would take a bite. ButLionsgate didafterSawdebuted at Sundance and now it's one of the most successful horror franchises of all time —we're up toSaw Xat this point. Just a little cautionary tale for any Australian studios not taking locally made horror seriously. How to watch:Sawisnow streaming on Max in the U.S.,on Netflix in the UK, and andon Stan in Australia. One of the only tech-based horror films on this list,Upgradeis a deeply Mashable movie.Sawco-creator Leigh Whannell wrote and directed this underrated cyberpunk revenge gem. Logan Marshall-Green is a compelling lead as Grey Trace, a tech-hating man who loses his wife in a vicious assault — and becomes paralysed. Convinced by mysterious inventor Eron Keen (a deeply creepy Harrison Gilbertson) to have a unique chip implanted in his body, Grey regains use of his limbs. But he doesn't just regain his regular human abilities, he's now an unstoppable revenge machine. And (of course) there's more than a few catches.

A glorious newer horror gem from director-writers Hannah Barlow and Kane Senes,SissybringsBlack Mirrorenergy to a slasher drenched in blood, bubbly, and social media influencer juice. Anchored in violent childhood playground trauma,Sissyis led by eponymous protagonist Cecilia (a spectacularly nuanced performance fromThe Bold Type's Aisha Dee), a self-help influencer, who'd rather keep her past — and embarrassing schoolyard nickname — buried. Running into her childhood best friend Emma (Barlow), she finds herself invited to a hen's weekend away at the property of an unwelcome blast from the past (Emily De Margheriti). Cecilia struggles to maintain the facade, and frankly, isn't feeling these negative vibes intruding in her \"safe space,\" you know? The perfect movie marathon partner toBodies Bodies Bodies,Sissyquite literally bludgeons influencer culture with some shockingly gory sequences, the body count climbing as quickly as Cecilia's likes.*— S.C. How to watch:Sissyis now streaming on Shudder. The directorial debut of Indianna Bell and Josiah Allen,You'll Never Find Medoes a lot with a little: two actors, one trailer, and the darkest, stormiest night. A tale of power, vulnerability, and mind games plays out when a woman (Jordan Cowan) shows up at a man called Patrick's (Brendan Rock) isolated trailer seeking shelter from the deluge. But who is she? Who is he? Do they know each other? Who has the upper hand here? You'll be kept guessing at every turn in this clever horror thriller. Mashable's Sam Haysomdescribed the film in his reviewas a \"a masterclass in tension, trapping us in a dingy room with its troubled leads and ratcheting up the suspense with lingering close-ups, oppressive sound design, and a script that keeps you guessing until the final moments.\" How to watch:You'll Never Find Meisnow streaming on Shudder. One of the strangest films you'll see in an age, Peter Weir's Australian New Wave classicThe Cars That Ate Pariseludes description (but we'll try). You'll be enticed by the film's poster images of a silver car bedecked in giant spikes, butMad Maxthis is not. Instead it's a creepy tale of the town of Paris (it was really filmed in Sofala), where the locals don't take too kindly to visitors. Traveller Arthur Waldo (Terry Camilleri) sees it all first-hand, and it's deeply weird stuff. It's almost a comedy, almost a thriller, almost a horror, almost an action, and absolutely worth your time. How to watch:The Cars That Ate Parisisnow available to rent/buy on Apple TV+. Writer-directors Michael and Peter Spierig'sDaybreakersmay have a predominantly Hollywood cast, but this Australian-American production fits the bill for this list. Vampires rule the world in this 2009 gem, with the creatures of the night rolling around town in blacked out cars. Problem is, they rule a little too hard, so there's a blood shortage, one that sees Ethan Hawke's vampire hematologist Edward (yes, Edward) working on a synthetic alternative, with ruthless overlord Charles Bromley (Sam Neill) breathing down everyone's necks. But Edward's literally derailed, finding his way into a group of humans including Australian icon Claudia Karvan and meeting former vamp Elvis, played to perfection by Willem Dafoe. How to watch:Daybreakersisnow streaming on AMC+ in the U.S.,on Plex in the UK, andon Stan in Australia. If you’re after midnight screening-worthy grindhouse horror,Wyrmwoodis for you. TheWyrmwoodfilms,Road of the DeadandApocalypse, are absolute chaos, drenched in blood, brutal sound effects, and deadpan humour. Made by the filmmaking Roache-Turner brothers, Kiah and Tristan, the two films are characterised by frantic close-ups and sickening zooms that bring you way too close to the action for comfort, overwhelming fish-eye lens use, a sharp script, and alotof gore. The first film,Wyrmwood: Road of the Dead, is a low budget zombie movie that delivers 90 minutes of screeching madness. It centres on siblings Brooke (Bianca Bradey) and Barry (Jay Gallagher), who separately come face to face with the outbreak in horrific circumstances. On the road to locate Brooke, Barry teams up with the hilarious Benny (Leon Burchill) and straight-talking Frank (Keith Agius). Brooke spends the film in a nightmare situation, imprisoned by a sadistic doctor, while her brother gets to ride around Mad Max vigilante style fighting zombies. But she gets her revenge. And as for the sequel,Wyrmwood: Apocalypse, which picks up immediately after the first film, we're talking bigger budget, old and new characters (with welcome additions in Shantae Barnes-Cowan, Tasia Zalar, and Luke McKenzie), and more high octane horror madness. There isn't one scene in these movies that's not covered in blood. How to watch:Wyrmwood: Road of the Deadisnow streaming on AMC+ in the U.S.,on ITVx in the UK, andon Stan in Australia.

Tracey Moffatt's surreal 1993 ghost story trilogyBeDevilis the artist's debut feature that premiered at Cannes. Weaving three ghost stories into one strange and undefinable nightmare,BeDevilembodies Moffatt's signature style, also seen in her revered shortNight Cries: A Rural Tragedy, with hyper-real sequences, extremely saturated colour, and an unsettling score to send you off kilter. Australian legend Jack Charles stars in \"Mr. Chuck\", the story of a swamp presence that haunts a young boy on Bribie Island, who reflects on it decades later in staged documentary interviews. In \"Choo Choo Choo Choo\" Moffatt herself plays Ruby Morphet, whose family are haunted on their property in Queensland. And in \"Lovin' the Spin I'm in\", a Torres Strait Islander couple meet a tragic fate. Geoff Burton’s striking cinematography, Wayne Le Clos’ erratic editing, Stephen Curtis’ dramatic production design, and Carl Vine’s bonkers score, all combine with Moffatt's vision to create a truly one of a kind creation — and it was thefirst feature film directed by an Australian Aboriginal woman. Plus, the choreography comes from future Bangarra Dance Theatre artistic director Stephen Page with his late brother, acclaimed dancer Russell Page, performing.

It's more of a thriller than a horror, but Richard Franklin'sRoadgamesdeserves a spot on this list because it's creepy and legendary. Stacy Keach gives one hell of a performance as Patrick Quid, who drives a truck (but don’t call him a truck driver) across Australia. He spends his drives talking to his dingo companion Boswell and amusing himself with his harmonica. Driving across the Nullabor with a truck full of meat to deliver to Perth, Patrick realises he's on the trail of a sadistic serial killer. Along the road he picks up hitchhiker Pamela Rushworth (Jamie Lee Curtis) and his hunt intensifies — and the lines between reality and hallucination begin to blur.

A messed up tale ofMisery-like violent obsession, body horror, teen angst, and incest,The Loved Onesis a nasty little bastard. Grieving teen Brent (Xavier Samuel) is held captive and tortured by teen psychopath Lola and her extremely creepy father after he turns down her invitation to the school dance. A glittering, disco ball-topped, blood-drenched party from hell, Lola's home dance is pure evil that gets worse and worse.The Loved Onescame out a few years after the storm of torture porn films likeSawandHostelwere dominating box offices, and director Sean Byrne inflicts a lot of nasty body horror in his feature debut. McLeavy is truly unhinged as our Carrie-meets-Annie Wilkes-inspired villain Lola, and Samuel has a tough job as Brent, spending most of the film unable to scream or move. You'll never listen to Kasey Chambers' \"Am I Not Pretty Enough?\" the same way. How to watch:The Loved Onesisnow streaming on Paramount+ in the U.S.,on ITVx in the UK, andon Stan in Australia. As bleak as it gets. AlongsideHounds of Love, these are two punishing, brutal movies I can't reallyrecommendwatching, but they've become so ingrained in the Australian horror narrative I thought I'd include a nod. Based on the real, horrifyingmurderscommitted in the '90s in Adelaide,Snowtown(also stylised asThe Snowtown Murders) is a deeply chilling, slow burning horror that comes here with a major content warning. These are extreme roles for the actors playing serial killers John Bunting (Daniel Henshall), Robert Wagner (Aaron Viergever), and James Vlassakis (Lucas Pittaway); Henshall's portrayal in particular is the stuff modern day nightmares are made of. How to watch:Snowtownisnow streaming on AMC+ in the U.S.,on BFI Player in the UK, and isavailable to rent/buy on Apple TV+ in Australia. A psychological horror-thriller,The Royal Hotelis another nightmare in the outback that fuses genres to deeply stressful effect. Directed byThe Assistant's Kitty Green, the film sees American backpackers Liv (Jessica Henwick) and Hanna (Julia Garner) hitting the road and finding work in the local pub of a mining town —the film was shot in the town of Yatina, South Australia, north of Adelaide. They just want to make some money to keep their trip going, but they're plunged into a tense pit of threat by the locals. Writing for Mashable, critic Siddhant Adlakhadescribes the filmas \"a concise, nail-biting movie about the world as experienced by women, and the aggressive (and often unspoken) impositions that define the male spaces around them.\" How to watch:The Royal Hotelisnow streaming on Hulu in the U.S.,on Now TV in the UK, andon Binge in Australia. Jon Bell's impactful, heartbreaking psychological horror filmThe Moogaiis one of the newer films on this list, out in 2024. An expansion ofBell's short of the same name, the film uses the supernatural creature feature format to examine generational trauma, specifically the lasting impact of the Australian government's forced removal of Aboriginal children from their communities known as the Stolen Generations.The Moogaiitself is a Bundjalung term for a spirit or entity who steals children — and as the film describes, \"A spirit whose primary aim is to do exactly what the white Australians have done for decades.\" Shari Sebbens delivers an impeccable performance as Sarah, a woman tormented by the Moogai and terrified of losing her children to it — and it's understandable, the character design here is the stuff of nightmares. How to watch:The Moogaihad a cinematic release in 2024, with streaming details TBC. Though it's not a true story, author Joan Lindsay's eerie tale,Picnic at Hanging Rock, has become a bit of an Australian myth, made further iconic through Peter Weir's moody, hypnotic film. The story goes that on Valentine's Day, 1900, a group of private school girls went for a picnic excursion at Hanging Rock near Mount Macdeon, Victoria — and not everyone returned. Disappeared without a trace. And that wouldn't be the end of the disturbing events. Weir's classic Australian New Wave film isn't shock horror, more a slow burning exercise in trance-like dread and unsolved mystery. You'll go to sleep with that eerie Romanian panpipe score rattling through your head, dreaming of straw hats and parasols. Plus, John Jarratt's in this one!

Hands down,Ghost Shipboasts one of the best opening scenes in a horror film. Directed by Steve Beck and written Mark Hanlon and John Pogue, this 2002 film should not be dismissed among its more schlocky 2000s peers. In the middle of the Bering Sea, passengers on Italian cruise ship MS Antonia Graza meet a grisly demise in the '60s. Decades later, a salvage crew investigates, and finds some passengers never really left — and have no intention of letting their new shipmates leave. The cast is a banger: Gabriel Byrne, Karl Urban, Julianna Margulies, Isaiah Washington, Alex Dimitriades, and a young Emily Browning.

If you love the devastating human stories of zombie tales likeThe Last of Us, you might likeCargo. Set in a post-apocalyptic South Australia amid a violent pandemic (but released before the COVID pandemic), Martin Freeman leads this horrible journey through the stunning Flinders Ranges. Directors Yolanda Ramke and Ben Howling developedCargofrom their viral short film, which was a 2018 Tropfest finalist (Australia's major short film festival). It's a moving story of survival and what we'll do for our loved ones, even in the most hopeless reality. When an inexorable tragedy strikes married couple Andy (Freeman) and Kay (Susie Porter), Andy is racing the clock to get his baby daughter Rosie somewhere safe. On the way Andy finds help in unexpected places, but not everyone's so accommodating. Freeman is exceptional, playing a man at the mercy of inevitability, and is well supported by a strong, small cast including David Gulpilil, Simone Landers, Susie Porter, Natasha Wanganeen, Kris McQuade, Anthony Hayes, and Bruce R. Carter.Cargonotably makes impactful points about colonial poisoning of and disrespect for the land itself, with the majority of the zombie-handling done by the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the land. How to watch:Cargoisnow streaming on Netflix. Taking villain cues from Australian classicRazorback(also in this list, of course),Boaris a gloriously grisly horror set in a small town called Kandanga. John Jarratt (yep!) successfully sheds theWolf Creekcreep for a beer-swilling, shit-talking widower channellingRazorback's Jake Cullen, on the hunt for a massive wild hog on the rampage. Two bickering old blokes (Jarratt and Roger Ward as Blue) four sheets to the wind are the best hope the town has. Writer-director Chris Sun's script is genuinely funny with uncomfortable characterisation at points (there’s a fair bit of casual sexism and homophobia in the script). The film also sheds the ‘70s love for pitting Australian towns as realms ofWake In Fright-level villains; the people of Kandanga are just regular folks who genuinely care about each other — and former WWE star Nathan Jones and soap star/singer Melissa Tkautz deliver standout performances.As Mashable's Sam Haysom put it,\"Any film that features a hippo-sized monster pig going up against a former WWE wrestler has to be a little bit tongue-in-cheek.\" How to watch:Boarisnow streaming on Shudder. The elevator pitch forBirdeateris pure horror in itself: a woman joins her fiancé at his all-male bucks weekend (for everyone outside Australia, that's a stag do or bachelor party). From the minutesinister Nice GuyLouis (Mackenzie Fearnley) suggests his girlfriend Irene (Shabana Azeez) join his mates for the weekend, things areoff. Directors Jack Clark and Jim Weir pay more than homage toWake In Frighthere, expertly suspending you in unease for two hours, drenched in beer, toxic masculinity, and deep dread. Clark's sparse, impactful script slowly reveals horrible truths about the characters' relationships and past actions. It's a cruel game of manipulation and gaslighting and it'll be more than awkward for everyone in the morning. How to watch:Birdeaterisnow showing in U.S. cinemasand is available torent/buy on Apple TV+ in Australia. Psychological horror requires a strong lead, and thankfully they don't get much stronger thanSuccessionstar Sarah Snook. In Daina Reid's tense nightmare, fertility doctor Sarah (Snook) struggles to cope with the increasingly odd behaviour of her seven-year-old daughter Mia (Lily LaTorre). I know what you're thinking: Unnerving kids are almost as well-worn a horror trope as mask-wearing serial killers. The good news, though, is Reid does an excellent job with the subgenre, taking a well-written script from Hannah Kent and layering in an uncanny atmosphere with a deeper journey into repressed childhood trauma. The clues are all there for us to unpack, butthe reveal at the end still provides a solid gut-punch, and the journey to get there is filled with excellent acting and ratcheting tension.*— S.H.

Users in the U.S. who open the app now are greeted with a popup that reads, \"Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now.\" Searches for \"how to get around TikTok ban US,\" \"how to bypass TikTok block,\" and \"TikTok VPN\" spiked immediately after the app went dark, according to Google Trends data. VPNs are a great tool to hide your IP address by connecting you to a secure server in a location of your choosing. Theoretically, that means you would be able to use a VPN to retain access to TikTok. And while thecybersecurity risks of using TikTokhave been well-documented, that isn't going to stop the most dedicated users. The surge in VPN interest sparked so intensely as the ban went into effect that NordVPN issues were immediately reported, according to Ziff Davis-owned site Downdetector. Despite attempting to use a VPN to bypass the ban, users flooded social media early Sunday morning with memes and complaints that the tactic did not work for them. Theories on how to get TikTok running in the US also began to circulate on social media. Some X users are reminding people to make sure the VPN is set to a country where TikTok isn't already banned, and others are saying that you have to use VPN to create a new account that isn't in the U.S. While Mashable has not put any of these theories to the test, it's important to note that the best way to regain access to TikTok could simply be to wait. President-elect Donald Trump has said he will likely give TikTok a 90-day extension to avoid a permanent ban,NBC reports. In the popup explaining the ban, TikTok notes that \"President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office.\" Trump will be sworn into office on Monday, which means it's possible an extension arrives swiftly. Until then, creators and users alike have to adjust tolife without TikTok. TopicsCybersecurityTikTok Joseph Green is the Global Shopping Editor for Mashable.

        "content": "National Geographic content straight to your inbox—sign up for our popular newsletters here Whether gliding over frozen lakes or carving a path through snowy forests, these wild ice skating spots offer a chance to connect with nature and explore scenery in a new way. As temperatures drop and waterways freeze over, outdoor adventure enthusiasts can lace up their skates in search of perfect ice skating spots. Finding the best place for wild or Nordic skating, which involves skating outdoors on naturally formed ice, is no easy feat — the ice has to be smooth, without impurities or a layer of snow on top yet thick enough to be safe to skate on (typically at least four inches). Remember to never skate alone, wear appropriate clothing and stay reasonably close to the shore. Here are a handful of destinations around the world where you can experience the thrill of wild ice skating. Widely regarded as one of the best places for wild skating, Sweden offers a variety of glassy frozen lakes suited for skaters of all levels. If you can bear the harsh temperatures, take a chance and venture closer to the Arctic Circle, where you may also be rewarded with witnessing the twinkling green and blue shades of the Northern Lights. If you’re not ready to venture to the Arctic, you can enjoy wild skating just 30 miles outside the capital, Stockholm — Lake Mälaren freezes over between November and April. Travellers are welcome to self-guide themselves, but can also book a tour throughGreen Trails, one of several companies offering guided skating trips across Sweden’s frozen lakes, starting at SEK 1650 (£120). (Go ice skating beneath the aurora borealis in the Swedish Arctic.) Lac de Joux sits on the French border, around an hour from Lausanne by train and is lauded as the largest free natural ice skating rink in Europe. It allows skaters to float along a seemingly endless frozen lake, surrounded by the towering Jura Mountains. Ice skate rental is available right by the lake and, on weekends, warm food and beverages are sold on the ice. Around six miles long and just over half-a-mile wide, Lac de Joux begins to freeze around mid-December and is fully frozen by February, where it typically stays solid until the end of March. Five hours from NYC and only two hours from Montreal, Mirror Lake in Lake Placid is especially good for beginner skaters looking for a laid-back and serene scenery. The two-time Winter Olympic Games host town allows visitors to skate on a two-mile-long ice track 24/7 when it reaches a safe thickness, which usually happens around mid-December. While you’re at it, venture outside the area and explore one of the other 3,000 lakes and ponds hidden in the Adirondack mountains. Skaters can guide themselves at their own pace, but anyone wanting a more structured hiking or snow sport experience can book throughGuide ADK, with tours starting at $200 (£164). (7 destinations for wild ice skating in North America.) Immerse yourself in the wild Canadian Rockies as you whirl along one of the several lakes in Banff National Park. Panoramic views of snow-capped mountains are just one of the many reasons to visit Banff in the wintertime. The best conditions for wild skating come earlier in the winter season around December before snow begins to cover the ice, making it harder to freely glide across the frozen lakes. Lake Louise, about a two-hour drive from Calgary, is by far the most popular lake for ice skaters but 40 Mile Creek to Vermilion Lakes, Two Jack Lake and Lake Minnewanka are other noteworthy options.Banff Adventuresis one of several providers offering winter experience packages starting at $104 (£85). Skaters, curlers and ice hockey players are all invited to explore Fiè Pond in Northern Italy during the winter months. The tiny Italian lake is a perfect spot for those wanting to leisurely skate without having to worry about drifting too far from land. Surrounded by fir trees and towering mountain peaks, Fiè Pond is one of the only ponds in the region to be cleared of snow during the winter. Skate rentals are offered onsite. The rental hut also offers food and drinks to enjoy after a long day of skating. Although there are no tours of Fiè Pond offered, visitors hoping to experience more of the Italian Dolomites can book an eight-day guided tour of the area throughExodus Adventure Travelsfrom £1,009.  Located on the Japanese island of Hokkaido, Lake Akan welcomes skaters from around mid-January once the lake is fully frozen solid. The tree-lined lake, which is a four-hour drive from Sapporo, is at the heart of the Akan-Mashu National Park and has views of several stratovolcanoes including Mount Me-Aken. By the beginning of February, the lake is transformed into ‘Iceland Akan’ with other activities such as snowmobiling and ice fishing on offer.G-Adventures offers Japan island-hopping tripsthat take guests from Tokyo to Sapporo, allowing to continue on to Lake Akan. Tours start around £3,699 and are offered year-round. (Alternative winter experiences, from ice-climbing in Italy to camping in Finland.)

        "title": "Heroes, villains, and childhood trauma in the MCEU and DCU",
        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "\"This study somewhat refutes the idea that villains are a product of their experiences.\" At least in fiction. Are superheroes and supervillains the product of their childhood experiences? Not if they belong to the Marvel Cinematic Extended Universe or DC Universe, according to anew paperpublished in the journal PLoS ONE. Canadian researchers watched many hours of those movies and looked at which characters suffered considerable childhood trauma. They concluded that those traumatic experiences were not significant factors in whether those characters turned out to be heroes or villains. Prior studies have looked at the portrayal oftrauma in superheroes, most notably the murder of Batman's parents and Spider-Man's uncle, as well as the destruction of Superman's home planet, Krypton. There has also been research on childrensustaining injurieswhile pretending to be superheroes, as well as on the potential for superhero themes to help childrenovercome traumaandbuild self-esteem. According to co-author Jennifer Jackson of the University of Calgary in Canada, two nursing students (since graduated) came up with the idea during a lab meeting to look at adverse childhood experiences and superheroes. It might seem a bit frivolous as a topic, but Jackson pointed out that Marvel and DC films reach audiences of hundreds of millions of people worldwide. \"We also know that things we see in films and other media affects life in the real world,\" she said. \"This influence could be used as a positive factor when supporting children's mental health and wellbeing. There may be shame or fear associated with some of the ACEs, and superheroes may be an effective ice breaker when broaching some difficult topics.\" The adverse childhood experiences (ACE) questionnaire has just 10 questions, covering such experiences as verbal, physical, or sexual abuse, living with an alcoholic or family member addicted to drugs, going hungry, or living with someone struggling with depression or mental illness. The higher one's ACE score, the more challenging one's childhood. The authors focused on identifying characters with sufficient screen time to learn enough about their childhoods to make a reasonable assessment based on the questionnaire. \"For example, Thanos is a very bad dude, but we didn't have enough information about his childhood to include him in the study,\" said Jackson. They also limited their study to Marvel and DC characters depicted in major films, rather than including storylines from spinoff TV series. So Wanda Maximoff/The Scarlet Witch was not included since much of her traumatic backstory appeared in the seriesWandaVision. Furthermore, \"We omitted gathering more characters from comic books in both Marvel and DC universes, due to their inconsistency in character development,\" the authors wrote. \"Comic book storylines often feature alternative plot lines, character arcs, and multiverse outcomes. The storytelling makes comic book characters highly inconsistent and challenging to score.\" They ended up watching 33 films, with a total runtime of 77 hours and 5 minutes. They chose 19 male characters, eight female characters, and one gender-fluid character (Loki) as \"subjects\" for their study, applying the ACE questionnaire to their childhoods as portrayed in the films. The results: \"We found no statistically significant differences between heroes and villains, Marvel and DC characters, or men and women and ACE scores,\" said Jackson. \"This means that characters who were portrayed as having difficult childhoods were not more likely to be villains. This study somewhat refutes the idea that villains are a product of their experiences. Based on the films we watched, people chose to be heroes and that was what made the difference—not their experiences.\" Notably, Black Widow had the highest ACE score (eight) and yet still became an Avenger, though the authors acknowledge that the character did some bad things before then and famously wanted to wipe out the \"red\" in her ledger. She \"represents resilience of characters who have experienced trauma,\" the authors wrote, as well as demonstrating that \"socio-ecological resilience, including access to social relationships and supportive communities, can play a mitigating role in the effect of ACEs.\" The Joker, by contrast, scored a six and \"wreaked havoc across Gotham City.\" The different characters exhibited different coping mechanisms for traumatic childhood experiences, like losing a parent (a common superhero trope). \"Both Batman and Shuri lost their fathers,\" said Jackson. \"Batman's coping strategy was largely self-isolation while Shuri connected with her community for support.\" Those different coping strategies \"may be a useful point of discussion when working with children,\" she added. Many of the villain narratives involved seeking retribution or revenge, but this was not strongly correlated with their childhood experiences. Loki, for instance, had an upbringing of royal privilege, albeit overshadowed by his \"brother\" Thor, yet still chose a path of villainy—at least initially. His character becomes much more nuanced over subsequent films. The authors ultimately placed Loki in the villain category since his character spent more time as a villain in the Marvel films. By contrast, they ultimately deemed Harley Quinn a hero since she abandoned her villainous ways after parting with the Joker. The study has its limitations. For one thing, the ACE questionnaire has been criticized for its simplicity, and it's possible that those 10 questions weren't sufficient to pick up on any meaningful differences between heroes and villains in the MCEU and DCU. Broadening the definition of trauma to include things like natural disasters might help. There is also a tendency for superhero movies to reinforce binary narratives of good versus evil, and the shortage of central women superheroes included in the study may have skewed the finding of no gender differences. And, of course, \"No [actual] superheroes or villains were involved in this research study,\" the authors noted, tongue firmly in cheek. \"If anyone could connect us with them, we would be happy to conduct a follow-up study to overcome this limitation.\" PLoS ONE, 2025.

The game between Ohio State and Notre Dame will be played on Monday. (AP Photo/Chris Carlson)                 ATLANTA (AP) — The curtain comes down Monday night on the longest,strangest college football seasonanyone has ever seen. About the only thing that feels normal about it are the teams playing for the title: Ohio State and Notre Dame. Two of the country’s most storied programs are set tomeet in a title gamethat wraps up the sport’s first 12-team playoff. The Jan. 20 finish is seven days later than the previous latest finish in history. This marksGame No. 16 for both teams— a practically unheard of number for a sport that for decades wrapped things up after 11 or 12 games on or around New Year’s Day. “I feel like we’ve been in the postseason since Week 3,” Notre Dame defensive coordinator Al Golden said. In most seasons, Week 3 would have marked the end of any championship hopes for the Fighting Irish, whose head coach, Marcus Freeman,could become the first African Americancoach to capture college football’s top prize. That was the week after Freeman & Co.lost to small, little-known Northern Illinois. Had the playoff still been a four-team affair, as it had the previous 10 years, it was hard to see any path to a title with that kind of loss on the resume. Now that 12 teams are in the mix — a product of years ofback-room machinations primed by billions in TV money, some of which willsoon go to the players themselves— things have changed. Notre Dame isn’t the only team grateful for that.  Ohio State’s13-10 loss to rival Michiganon Thanksgiving weekend not only had the feel of a season wrecker, but had people calling for the job of Buckeyes coach Ryan Day. It was Day’s fourth straight loss to the Wolverines, and this one came with Ohio State as a 20-point favorite and apparently cruising toward a shot at the Big Ten title. After the loss,about the only way the coach could save his job,or so the narrative went, was to win the national title. And here we are. “There are some great stories about what was said behind closed doors, some of the challenges that were raised” after the Michigan game, Day said. “But the only way those stories get told is if a banner gets raised.” A few things to watch for in the game: Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard is a dual threat. He has passed for 19 touchdowns and rushed for 16. Ohio State’s top-ranked defense in both points and yards allowed might have to bring an extra defender close to the line to account for Leonard’s possibilities. ... Notre Dame’s defense has forced 32 turnovers this season and scored a nation-best 151 points off of them. Winning that battle again figures to be key to the Irish’s chances of pulling off an upset. ... Ohio State’s biggest playmaker,receiver Jeremiah Smith, got bottled up in the semifinals. He made one catch for three yards against Texas. Notre Dame’s defense has lost five starters to season-ending injuries. To win, the replacements will have to figure out a way to keep Smith quiet again. Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign uphere.

        "source": "https://nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "A winter visit to Denmark’s snow-dusted capital opens the door to local delights and offbeat experiences like winter swimming and urban skiing. When snow falls in Copenhagen, the city’s cobbled streets, turreted castles and colourful homes feel like something out of a fairytale, making the colder months the perfect time of year to discover the cosy character of the Danish capital. Take inspiration from the locals and enjoy a cold swim in the harbour, queue up for traditional festive cakes at one of the city’s excellent bakeries or race down the world’s first ski slope built on top of a power plant. It's also a great time to discover Danish culture in the city's impressive museums and galleries, ideal for those looking to keep in the heat. Here are seven experiences not to miss on a winter visit to Copenhagen. The Danish version of Mardi Gras,Fastelavn, usually falls in February, but will be taking place on 2 March in 2025. To celebrate this annual event, bakeries create a special cream-filled bun called afastelavnsbolle.These decadent buns are sold from January onwards, and in recent years, the occasion has turned into a wild bun-fest, where gourmet bakers try to outdo each other with the most lavish creations. Go bakery-hopping around the city’s best spots —Juno,HartandKøbenhavns Bageriare just three to try —and see if you can decide which treat is best. Challenge yourself to swim with the Danes in Copenhagen’s freezing-cold harbour. Although it may take the courage of a Viking to jump in, winter swimming has become hugely popular in the city, and fans of the activity say it helps them fight stress, reduces high blood pressure and builds resilience. AtCopenhot,located in up-and-coming Refshaleøen, there are saunas and hot tubs to keep you warm on a cold day, as well as a cold plunge pool to cool off in. Alternatively, visit the city’s newest swanky floating spa,Glæcier, on a Tuesday evening for asaunagus— a guided sauna experience with music and scented oils. Take advantage of Copenhagen’s long winter nights and go stargazing.The Round Towerhosts special winter stargazing nights in its historic observatory in the heart of the city. Copenhagen also hosts its ownLight Festivalevery February, with neon-lit installations that shine brightly against the pitch-black skies. Experience this colourful event on a guided tour, canal cruise or by taking onThe Light Run— a scenic 7km race through Copenhagen’s lit-up streets. Copenhagen has a strong culture of communal dining, with many venues featuring long shared tables where you can sit and chat to new friends over a family-style dinner. At the beloved culture house and community centreAbsalon, dinner is served at 6pm every night of the week. If you want to stay on afterwards, the centre has a bar, and also hosts silent discos, life drawing classes and ceramics workshops.Nordhus, the city’s newest culture house, serves family-style, veggie-packed communal dinners from Tuesday to Sunday. Or, to the south,Kanalhusetin history-packed Christianshavn is another classic communal dining spot. Copenhagen is one of the only places in the world where you don’t have to leave the urban centre to hit the slopes.Copenhill, designed by local architect Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), is a recreational facility, hiking path and ski spot on top of a waste-to-energy plant. The slope is suitable for first-time skiers as well as experts, and there’s also a freestyle park and slalom course to try. If you prefer skates to skis, ice skating on one of the city’s traditional outdoor rinks is a great way to get active. Rent skates atKongens NytorvorBroens Ice Skating Rinkand spend an hour gliding around the floodlit ice. Hygge, a Danish concept that embodies a feeling of cosiness and taking time to enjoy life’s simple pleasures, is top of mind atDesign Museum Danmarkthis winter, where a new exhibition focuses on ceramic mugs. This exhibit looks at the design process behind ceramics and showcases mugs from an array of inspiring artists. Head to the museum’s beautiful Format café afterwards to enjoy a mug of hot chocolate. Or visitGlyptoteket, the city’s art and sculpture museum, where amid the beautiful marble busts, French impressionist paintings and Egyptian mummies, you’ll find a winter garden complete with palm trees that feels like a mini oasis. Copenhagen was the home of legendary fairytale writer Hans Christian Andersen and 19th century theologian and philosopher Søren Kierkegaard — so, naturally, the city has plenty of stories to tell. AtThe Black Diamondlibrary and culture centre, you can visit exhibitions and see historic manuscripts from famous writers. TheKaren Blixen Museum, located at the celebrated Danish author’s childhood home in Rungstedlund, just north of the city, allows you to see where she wrote some of her most famous works. Meanwhile, theCopenhagen University Library, dating to 1479, has opened its doors to visitors this winter, letting travellers marvel at the library's grand book hall. The city is also packed with bookshops for more modern tastes, with shops likeThiemers Magasin,Books&CompanyandPolitikens Boghalselling books in English.

        "content": "\"America's decline is over,\" Trump said. President Donald Trump offered a scathing rebuke of his predecessor's term while laying out the immediate actions he plans to take on the first day of his second term in office, saying in hisinaugurationremarks, \"America's decline is over.\" Trump whiplashed between painting a dire picture of the country under the Biden administration while proclaiming himself as a \"peacemaker and unifier\" and that the \"Golden Age\" of the country is beginning. He also referenced his personal legal battles and historic political comeback to the White House during his nearly 30-minute remarks after taking the oath of office in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. Here are some key takeaways from his first remarks as the 47th president of the United States. Trump immediately took aim at Joe Biden's leadership, as the now-former president sat in the rotunda, though he didn't mention his predecessor by name. Trump in particular focused on immigration and recent natural disasters, including the hurricane in North Carolina and wildfires in Los Angeles. \"My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal, and all of these many betrayals that have taken place, and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed, their freedom,\" Trump said. Like he did on the 2024 campaign trail, Trump painted a dark picture of the current state of the U.S. \"From this moment on, America's decline is over,\" he said. \"Our liberties and our nation's glorious destiny will no longer be denied, and we will immediately restore the integrity, competency, and loyalty of America's government.\" Trump laid out some of theexecutive actionshe plans to take on Day 1, including declaring a national emergency at the southern border and a national energy emergency to \"drill, baby, drill.\" He said he would send troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to \"repel the disastrous invasion of our country,\" reinstate his \"Remain in Mexico\" policy and end the practice of \"catch and release,\" among other actions. \"With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense,\" he said. \"It's all about common sense.\" Trump said he plans todismantle diversity, equity and inclusion(DEI) initiatives within the federal government and \"end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life.\" \"We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based,\" he said. Trump further waded into theculture warsand said that, as of Monday, the official policy of the United States government will be that there are only two genders, male and female. The inauguration came a day after the ceasefire and hostage deal went into effect between Israel and Gaza, for which Trump hassought to take credit. \"My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier,\" he said, noting that \"one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families.\" He said he wants to measure success by the wars the U.S. ends and \"perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.\" Trump continued to lay out hisexpansionist visionfor the U.S., including a plan to gain control of the Panama Canal. \"American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form, and that includes the United States Navy,\" he said. \"Above all, China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama. And we're taking it back.\" He alsoreiterated his planto rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. Trump, who has been convicted by a jury of his peers and was indicted four times after his first term, referred to his legal troubles during his speech. \"Never again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents -- something I know something about,\" said Trump, continuing to contend that he was politically prosecuted. \"We will not allow that to happen. It will not happen again. Under my leadership, we will restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law.\" The two cases against him were dropped after he won reelection, with prosecutors citing longstanding Justice Department policy that a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime. He also referred to the assassination attempt against him in Pennsylvania last year. \"Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and indeed, to take my life. Just a few months ago in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin's bullet ripped through my ear, but I felt then, and believe even more so now that my life was saved for a reason. I was saved by God to Make America Great Again.\" Trump celebrated hishistoric comebackthroughout his speech. He is only the second president in U.S. history, after Grover Cleveland in 1892, to win election to a non-consecutive second term, and is the first convicted felon to take the office. \"Many people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback. But as you see today, here I am, the American people have spoken,\" Trump said. ABC News' Alexandra Hutzler contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "New plans will be cheaper for those who want Gemini, pricier for those who don't. Google has added AI features to its regular Workspace accounts for business while slightly raising the baseline prices of Workspace plans. Previously, AI tools in the Gemini Business plan were a $20 per seat add-on to existing Workspace accounts, which had a base cost of $12 per seat without. Now, the AI tools are included for all Workspace users, but the per-seat base price is increasing from $12 to $14. That means that those who were already paying extra for Gemini are going to pay less than half of what they were—effectively $14 per seat instead of $32. But those who never used or wanted Gemini or any other newer features under the AI umbrella from Workspace are going to pay a little bit more than before. Features covered here include access to Gemini Advanced, the NotebookLM research assistant, email and document summaries in Gmail and Docs, adaptive audio and additional transcription languages for Meet, and \"help me write\" and Gemini in the side panel across a variety of applications. Google says that it plans \"to roll out even more AI features previously available in Gemini add-ons only.\" This perhaps not-so-coincidentally follows a recent announcement from Microsoft that Copilot Pro AI features would be baked into the base cost of Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscriptions. As is often the case with these enterprise software suites, the fine print is complicated, with varying terms for different kinds of users. As a top-level summary: Customers will be on this new pricing scheme immediately, while existing Workspace accounts begin on March 17. Those who've been shelling out $20 a month per seat for Gemini for Workspace won't be charged for that subscription anymore starting on February 1, but they'll retain access. These changes don't yet apply to small-business customers, though—but Google suggests that's temporary. Likewise, these changes aren't happening right now for education and nonprofit accounts. Google outlines the various edge cases in detail inits blog postif you care to dig in. Until recently, LLM- and deep learning-based features were generally treated as an extra or separate service by SaaS companies, but we're seeing a recent shift to baking them right into the core offerings like any other feature, and this is part of that trend.

        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "Numerous orders will be signed Monday, with others coming \"as soon as possible.\" PresidentDonald Trumpwill order a \"national energy emergency\" and issue a \"presidential memorandum on inflation\" as part of a slew of executive actions on his first day in office, incoming White House officials told reporters Monday morning. Among the actions described by the official includes orders related to immigration and transgender Americans, as well as actions aimed at the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs across federal agencies. Trump and his advisers have also prepared an executive order directing the incoming attorney general and the heads of all departments and agencies to review law enforcement conduct over the last four years, multiple sources familiar with the matter said. That order -- which advisers are calling \"ending weaponization in the federal government\" -- doesn't explicitly direct any criminal investigations, but asks for a review of law enforcement activity and actions taken by the intelligence community over the course of Joe Biden's presidency. It's not clear if Trump will sign that order on Monday, but it's a sign that Trump's administration plans to \"investigate the investigators,\" as he has previously indicated he would. Trump's top advisers, including his incoming DOJ leadership, are preparing for a storm of legal challenges to some of his most controversial actions, one top adviser told ABC News. \"We're going to get sued on all of these things,\" the adviser said, adding that the volume of litigation is expected to be a full-time job for Trump's Department of Justice. During Trump's first administration, he faced upwards of 400 lawsuits challenging his actions. His advisers anticipate more than that this time around. There will be a team inside the DOJ that is just dedicated to defending Trump's actions in court, sources said. As part of Trump's executive actions that are expected to be signed \"as soon as possible,\" officials said Trump will \"put an end to the [Biden administration's] electric vehicle mandate.\" Another order will focus solely on Alaska, which officials said has \"an incredible abundance of natural resources.\" Officials said these moves were not only intended to spur the economy and bring down costs, but also \"strengthen our nation's national security,\" citing the impending \"AI race with China.\" The primary order Trump is expected to sign Monday will focus on \"unleashing\" American energy, which officials said would emphasize \"cutting the red tape and the burdens and regulations that have held back our economy, have held back investments, job creation and natural resource production.\" The national energy emergency Trump expects to sign will \"unlock a variety of different authorities that will enable our nation to quickly build again, to produce more natural resources, to create jobs, to create prosperity and to strengthen our nation's national security,\" officials said. Officials did not share details on the presidential memorandum to address inflation, saying only that it would be an \"all-of-government approach to bringing down costs for all American citizens.\" Drilling reached record highs during the Biden administration -- but Biden he also tookexecutive actionsto ban future offshore oil and natural gas drilling on America's East and West coasts, the Eastern Gulf of Mexico and Alaska's North Bering Sea. On a call with reporters Monday morning, incoming White House officials previewed a series of executive orders and other actions the new Trump administration plans to take relating to the border and immigration. \"We will protect the American people against invasion,\" one of the incoming officials said. \"This is about national security. This is about public safety. And this is about the victims of some of the most violent, abusive criminals we've seen enter our country in our lifetime. And it ends today.\" Among the executive actions outlined, the incoming officials said Trump will declare a national emergency at the border and clarify the military's role in \"protecting the territorial integrity of the United States.\" The orders will reinstate the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, end the practice of \"Catch and Release,\" and complete the building of the wall at the southern border, officials said. They will designate drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, end the ability for migrants caught between ports of entry to claim asylum, and suspend the resettlement of refugees for at least four months, they said. Trump will also seek to end birthright citizenship, in which the federal government recognizes the American citizenship for the children of migrants born in the United States, officials said. Officials also said Trump will order \"enhance vetting and screening\" of migrants and direct agencies to provide recommendations for suspending entry for migrants from \"countries of particular concern.\" He will also create Homeland Security task forces to target undocumented gang members and criminals, and restore the death penalty when a law enforcement officer is murdered by an undocumented migrant, officials said. While one of the incoming officials said the call was a \"preview\" of the \"actions to be taken today,\" it was not clear from the call that all the orders would happen Monday. In addition, many of the plans would require help from international partners like Mexico and would almost certainly spark legal battles. An incoming official said orders related to diversity, equity, and inclusion policies in the federal government are intended to create \"equal treatment\" andend DEI in the federal government. Saying it was \"very fitting\" for the orders to be coming on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the official said orders will ask for the Office of Management and Budget and The U.S. Office of Personnel Management to coordinate with the various agencies to \"terminate\" all DEI programs in the agency, including positions that have been renamed. This also includes environmental justice programs, equity related grants, equity action plans, and equity initiatives, according to the official. There will also be a monthly meeting planned between members of the Department of Justice and Deputy Secretary of Trump admin agencies to assess any other DEI programs that officials plan to dismantle further, the official said. Specific programs the orders will look to end include the Federal Aviation Administration recruiting \"individuals who suffer from severe intellectual disabilities\" and the USDA spending a billion dollars on environmental justice. While the action does not address any private companies' use of DEI programs, the incoming Trump official, when asked, said to \"wait and see\" regarding further action regarding private companies. \"Private business should wait and see. We have more actions on DEI very soon,\" the official said. Incoming officials also outlined a series of first-day executive actions that they described as efforts to \"restore sanity,\" including executive orders declaring that the U.S. government will only recognize a person's gender assigned at birth, prohibiting federal funds from being used in programs that acknowledge people who identify as transgender. Among the most tangible changes Americans might see is a change to passports, rescinding a rule under Biden that allowed Americans to mark \"X\" as their gender marker on their U.S. passport applications. Trump also plans to rescind rules set by Biden that withheld federal money from schools, including colleges, unless they followed certain rules to protect trans students from harassment. Entities that receive federal dollars like prisons and shelters also would have to designate \"single sex\" spaces, officials said, assigning people to certain areas based on their gender assigned at birth. In announcing the changes, which could have sweeping implications, officials took few questions from reporters and did not provide specifics. \"It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female. These are sexes that are not changeable, and they are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality,\" one official said. The incoming White House officials did not share the specific text of Trump's planned executive orders. They will be circulated to the press once they are signed by the president, officials said.

        "content": "GM sold geolocation and other driving data without adequate consent, FTC says. General Motors and its subsidiary OnStar agreed to a settlement that prohibits them from sharing driver location and behavior data with third parties, the Federal Trade Commissionannouncedyesterday. The proposed settlement comes less than a year after GM responded to public backlash byannouncingthat it stopped sharing driving data from its connected cars with companies such as LexisNexis. The FTC said it \"is taking action against General Motors (GM) and OnStar over allegations they collected, used, and sold drivers' precise geolocation data and driving behavior information from millions of vehicles—data that can be used to set insurance rates—without adequately notifying consumers and obtaining their affirmative consent.\" GM did not admit to or deny the allegations. GM and OnStar \"will be banned for five years from disclosing consumers' sensitive geolocation and driver behavior data to consumer reporting agencies,\" the FTC said. Under thesettlement, \"consumer reporting agency\" means a firm that collects or evaluates \"consumer credit information or other information on consumers for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to other parties and which uses any means or facility of interstate commerce for the purpose of preparing or furnishing consumer reports.\" A New York Timesreportlast year described how the data sharing works. \"After LexisNexis and Verisk [a data broker that works with the insurance industry] get data from consumers' cars, they sell information about how people are driving to insurance companies,\" the NYT report said. \"To access it, the insurance companies must get consent from the drivers—say, when they go out shopping for car insurance and sign off on boilerplate language that gives insurance companies the right to pull third-party reports.\" A pendingclass-action lawsuitagainst GM, OnStar, and LexisNexis alleges that the defendants deceived and harmed consumers. The FTC said itscomplaintalleged that \"GM used a misleading enrollment process to get consumers to sign up for its OnStar connected vehicle service and the OnStar Smart Driver feature.\" Lina Khan, who is in her final week as FTC chair, said that \"GM monitored and sold people's precise geolocation data and driver behavior information, sometimes as often as every three seconds.\" The proposed settlement was approved in a closed meeting by the FTC's three Democrats, with the two Republicans recorded as absent. The pending agreement will be subject to public comment for 30 days after publication in the Federal Register, and a final FTC decision will be made under the Trump administration. In addition to location data, the GM/FTC settlement covers \"radio listening data regarding specific content, channel, or station; hard braking, hard acceleration, hard cornering, crossing of a designated high-speed threshold, seat belt usage, or late-night driving; and trip time and duration for such events.\" GM and OnStar agreed to delete data collected before the settlement and ask third parties to delete data previously shared with them. GM also \"must allow consumers to disable the collection of Location Data from their Vehicles to the extent the Vehicle is equipped with the necessary technology.\" GM issued apress releaseon the settlement. \"Last year, wediscontinuedSmart Driver across all GM vehicles, unenrolled all customers, and ended our third-party telematics relationships with LexisNexis and Verisk,\" GM said. \"In September, weconsolidatedmany of our US privacy statements into a single, simpler statement as part of our broader work to keep raising the bar on privacy... As part of the agreement, GM will obtain affirmative customer consent to collect, use, or disclose certain types of connected vehicle data (with exceptions for certain purposes).\" Affirmative consent is not required for purposes such as providing driver data to emergency responders, responding to customer-initiated communications, complying with government requests and legal requirements, and investigating product quality or safety problems. While the ban on sharing driving data lasts only five years, the overall settlement would be in place for 20 years.

However, within minutes, residents and tourists in the Turks and Caicos Islands, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico shared videos showing a shower of debris falling through the atmosphere along Starship's expected flight corridor. The videos confirmed Starship—the rocket's upper stage—broke apart in space, or experienced a \"rapid unscheduled disassembly\" in SpaceX-speak. This happened well short of the spacecraft's planned trajectory, which would have seen it fly halfway around the world and splash down in the Indian Ocean after more than an hour of flight. There were no people or satellites aboard the rocket Thursday. Just saw the most insane#spacedebris#meteorshowerright now in Turks and Caicos ⁦@elonmusk⁩ what is it??pic.twitter.com/a7f4MbEB8Q — Dean Olson (@deankolson87)January 16, 2025 The test flight began with the liftoff of the 404-foot-tall (123.1-meter) Super Heavy booster and Starship upper stage from the Texas Gulf Coast at 4:37 pm CST (5:37 pm EST; 22:37 UTC). The world's largest and most powerful launcher climbed off the launch pad with more than twice the thrust of NASA's Apollo-era Saturn V rocket. Heading east, its 33 methane-fueled Raptor booster engines fired for more than two and a half minutes to propel Starship toward the edge of space. The booster's engines shut down as planned, followed moments later by the ignition of six Raptor engines on the Starship upper stage. The Super Heavy booster separated from the rocket to fly itself back to the launch site. Just shy of seven minutes after liftoff, the booster returned to the launch pad for a mid-air catch by the tower's two mechanical arms,repeating a feat SpaceX accomplished in October. The upper stage, meanwhile, appeared to fly normally until a telemetry display on SpaceX's webcast indicated that one of the ship's six engines shut off more than seven minutes after liftoff. The display then showed more engines failing, and the data stream froze. In an update posted on SpaceX's website later Thursday evening, officials said ground teams lost contact with the spacecraft approximately eight and a half minutes into the flight. At the time, information on SpaceX's live video stream showed the vehicle was traveling at about 13,246 mph (21,317 km/hr) at an altitude of about 91 miles (146 kilometers). \"Initial data indicates a fire developed in the aft section of the ship, leading to a rapid unscheduled disassembly with debris falling into the Atlantic Ocean within the predefined hazard areas,\"SpaceX officials wrote in the update. The falling debris caused air traffic controllers to divert or reroute commercial flights over the Caribbean and the Atlantic Ocean, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Air traffic controllers have the ability to activate a \"Debris Response Area\" if a spacecraft experiences an anomaly with debris falling outside of identified closed aircraft hazard areas, where the FAA notifies pilots in advance about the risk of reentering space junk. Activating a Debris Response Area \"allows the FAA to direct aircraft to exit the area and prevent others from entering,\" the statement read. This is what the FAA did Thursday evening. Air traffic controllers closed a swath of airspace between the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico to commercial air traffic for more than an hour, causing some passenger airline flights to enter a holding pattern, return to their departure airports, land at alternate airfields, or delay their takeoffs. Flight-tracking sites and apps showed the extent of the impacts on air traffic. Miami International Airport and Fort Lauderdale International Airport, both hubs for flights to and from the Caribbean, reported short flight delays due to a \"rocket launch anomaly,\" according to an FAA website. Ars listened to live audio from air traffic control in San Juan, Puerto Rico, as controllers alerted pilots of the airspace restrictions. \"How long do you think this hold is going to be? We don't have a lot of gas to play with,\" one pilot asked air traffic control. \"The sooner we can get on the ground, the better.\" A short time later, the airspace reopened, and flights continued on to their destinations or diverted to other airports. Some of the videos recorded by residents and tourists in the Turks and Caicos appeared to show fiery debris fragments streaking almost directly overhead. Many people speaking in the videos did not realize what they were seeing, but space enthusiasts on social media quickly identified the source of the spectacle. First night in Turks and Caicos and we’re on the beach and see this. 👀pic.twitter.com/CDPlLd70Yn — KingDomRedux (@KingDomRedux)January 16, 2025 Elon Musk, SpaceX's founder and CEO,wrote on Xthat early signs from data suggested there was a propellant leak in a cavity above Starship's engine firewall. The leak was large enough to build pressure in excess of the ship's vent capacity. \"Apart from obviously double-checking for leaks, we will add fire suppression to that volume and probably increase vent area,\" Musk wrote. \"Nothing so far suggests pushing next launch past next month.\" Coming into 2025, SpaceX officials hoped to launch as many as 25 Starship test flights this year to experiment with new designs, attempt a recovery of Starship from orbit, and demonstrate orbital refueling, a capability that is critical to NASA and SpaceX's plans to land astronauts on the Moon later this decade. SpaceX designed Starship to be fully reusable, with the ability to deliver more than 100 metric tons (220,000 pounds) of cargo to low-Earth orbit. Future versions of the ship will be suited for travel to the Moon and Mars. NASA has two contracts for SpaceX to develop a derivative of Starship as a human-rated lander for the agency's Artemis lunar program, and Musk views Starship as central to enabling his vision of creating a human settlement on the red planet. NASA's official public schedule calls for acrew landing at the Moon's south pole in 2027, using the privately developed Starship alongside the agency's government-managed Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule. Together, the vehicles will transport astronauts from Earth to the Moon, then to the lunar surface and back into space, and finally back to Earth. However, this schedule hinges on the readiness of Starship to accommodate humans, the availability of new lunar spacesuits, and the status of the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft, both of which have endured lengthy delays. The incoming Trump administration is expected to reevaluate the architecture of the Artemis program to determine if, and how, NASA can return humans to the Moon faster and cheaper. It's possible SpaceX's Starship and other commercial rockets might carve out a more significant role. If SpaceX can fly Starship again as soon as next month, it's possible the company could preserve its aims for the program this year. SpaceX has no shortage of hardware ready or nearly ready to go. There are multiple Starships and Super Heavy boosters undergoing preparations for future test flights at the company's Starbase launch facility near Brownsville, Texas. But schedules often slip in the launch business, and the FAA could ground Starship until SpaceX completes a formal mishap investigation. The federal regulator is responsible for ensuring public safety on commercial space launches. A spokesperson told Ars late Thursday that the FAA is assessing the Starship anomaly and will provide a statement when officials know more. In the hours after Thursday's test flight, Musk took to his social media platform to share and comment on several videos of the Starship debris coming back to Earth. SpaceX has long embraced failures as learning opportunities, and the company's culture is centered on rapidly iterating on designs—build, test, break, fix. This launch debuted amore advanced, slightly taller version of Starship, known as Version 2 or Block 2, with larger propellant tanks, a new avionics system, and redesigned feed lines flowing methane and liquid oxygen propellants to the ship's six Raptor engines. SpaceX officials did not say whether any of these changes might have caused the problem on Thursday's launch. SpaceX officials have repeatedly and carefully set expectations for each Starship test flight. They routinely refer to the rocket as experimental, and the primary focus of the rocket's early demo missions is to gather data on the performance of the vehicle.What works, and what doesn't work? Still, the outcome of Thursday's test flight is a clear disappointment for SpaceX. This was the seventh test flight of SpaceX's enormous rocketand the first time Starship failed to complete its launch sequence since the second flight in November 2023. Until now, SpaceX has made steady progress, and each Starship flight has achieved more milestones than the one before. On thefirst flight in April 2023, the rocket lost control a little more than two minutes after liftoff, and the ground-shaking power of the booster's 33 engines shattered the concrete foundation beneath the launch pad. Seven months later,on Flight 2, the rocket made it eight minutes before failing. On that mission, Starship failed at roughly the same point of its ascent, just before the cutoff of the vehicle's six methane-fueled Raptor engines. Back then, a handful of photos and images from the Florida Keys and Puerto Rico showed debris in the sky after Starship activated its self-destruct mechanism due to an onboard fire caused by a dump of liquid oxygen propellant. But that flight occurred in the morning, with bright sunlight along the ship's flight path. This time, the ship disintegrated and reentered the atmosphere at dusk, with impeccable lighting conditions accentuating the debris cloud's appearance. These twilight conditions likely contributed to the plethora of videos posted to social media on Thursday. Thethird Starship test flight last Marchsaw the spacecraft reach its planned trajectory and fly halfway around the world before succumbing to the scorching heat of atmospheric reentry. In June, thefourth test flightended with controlled splashdowns of the rocket's Super Heavy booster in the Gulf of Mexico and of Starship in the Indian Ocean. In October, SpaceX caught the Super Heavy booster with mechanical arms at the launch pad for the first time, proving out the company's audacious approach to recovering and reusing the rocket. On this fifth test flight, SpaceX modified the ship's heat shield to better handle the hot temperatures of reentry, and the vehicle again made it to an on-target splashdown in the Indian Ocean. Most recently,Flight 6 on November 19demonstrated the ship's ability to reignite its Raptor engines in space for the first time and again concluded with a bullseye splashdown. But SpaceX aborted an attempt to again catch the booster back at Starbase due to a problem with sensors on the launch pad's tower. With Flight 7, SpaceX hoped to test more changes to the heat shield protecting Starship from reentry temperatures up to 2,600° Fahrenheit (1,430° Celsius). Musk has identified the heat shield as one of the most difficult challenges still facing the program. In order for SpaceX to reach its ambition for the ship to become rapidly reusable, with minimal or no refurbishment between flights, the heat shield must be resilient and durable. While the three previous Starship test flights each softly splashed down at sea, onboard camera views showed some of the ship's heat-absorbing ceramic tiles stripping away from the vehicle during reentry. Other changes on Flight 7 included a new tapered edge to the line where the tiles meet the ship's stainless steel skin and multiple metallic tile options, including one with active cooling, to test alternative heat shield materials. SpaceX also wanted to test the thermal performance of new fittings that will be used to catch Starship back at the launch tower on future flights. Engineers were eager to see how redesigned flaps near the nose of Starship worked during its descent back to Earth. And once the ship reached space, SpaceX intended to release 10 mock-ups of next-generation Starlink Internet satellites to test the ship's payload deployment mechanism for the first time. All those objectives will now have to wait until Flight 8. Going into this launch, Musk hoped to attempt to catch the Starship upper stage, similar to the way SpaceX recovered the Super Heavy booster, as soon as the next test flight. Now, that will likely have to wait until a later mission. \"As always, success comes from what we learn, and this flight test will help us improve Starship’s reliability as SpaceX seeks to make life multiplanetary,\" SpaceX said. \"Data review is already underway as we seek out root cause. We will conduct a thorough investigation, in coordination with the FAA, and implement corrective actions to make improvements on future Starship flight tests.\" Listing image:\n    Aurich Lawson | Getty Images Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

        "content": "Get more from Nat Geo Health—trusted, science-based advice on trending wellness topics From gentle to lighthouse parenting, the right parenting style could improve your child's well-being. We are living in an age of metaphorical parenting. First it was tiger parenting. Then helicopter parenting, snowplow parenting, and free-range parenting became trends. Now, gentle parenting is having an extended moment. But many parents may wonder: Do these parenting styles actually make a difference to a child’s development and future well-being? “Parents are eager for answers and these messages become seductive on social media,” says Annie Pezalla, a developmental psychologist and visiting assistant professor of psychology at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. As a culture, “we’re becoming increasingly prescriptive about what to say or do or not do with the mentality that we could screw up our kids if we say or do the wrong thing,” she says. (How can you help your kid flourish? Experts say to help them find \"flow.\") Scientists have long wrangled with the question of how your parenting style affects your children. In the 1960s,psychologist Diana Baumrindidentified three research-based approaches to parenting: authoritarian parenting, which involves strict rules, high expectations, and often harsh discipline; authoritative parenting, which is characterized by a close, nurturing relationship and guiding kids to meet high standards; and permissive parenting, which is characterized by warmth and few rules or expectations as kids navigate situations on their own. Later, a fourth style—neglectful (or uninvolved) parenting—was added to the mix. The problem with these original characterizations is that “people cannot relate to those words,” says Kenneth Ginsburg, a physician and founder and program director of the Center of Parent and Teen Communication at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “If you’re going to help parents know what to do and what to say, you need a new name.” Which is how these new metaphorical parenting styles came to be. In contrast to the traditional parenting styles, these newer ones don’t have as much research behind them—and they can mean different things to different people. Here’s what experts say about six of the newer parenting styles and their potential consequences for kids. Known for prioritizing compassion, warmth, and respect, gentle parenting is an approach that has gained popularity in recent years. A major hallmark of this style is the focus on fostering a strong bond between children and their parents. “It involves approaching parenting with attunement—being able to look at things through a child’s perspective,” says Sarah Bren, a licensed clinical psychologist and cofounder of the Upshur-Bren Psychology Group in Pelham, New York. Depending on how boundaries are set and discipline is handled, it can look a bit like authoritative or permissive parenting, experts say. (Boredom can actually help kids reach their creative potential. Here's how.) “Kids do well when they have warmth and discipline,” Pezalla says, but the gentle parenting style can be hard for parents to sustain.A study led by Pezalla published in a 2024 issue ofPLoS Onefound that one-third of those who identified as “gentle parents” expressed doubts about their parenting abilities and experienced feelings of burnout. Whether this parenting approach has a better effect on kids than others hasn’t been well studied yet. Parents who adhere to snowplow parenting—which is also called lawnmower parenting or bulldozer parenting—often try to clear obstacles out of a child’s path. The parents’ intentions may be good—they don’t want their kids to struggle or feel distressed—but this isn’t realistic because challenges are an inherent part of life. As a parent, “you want kids to handle adversity or conflict with your support and guidance to help them build resilience,” says Bren. If you regularly remove obstacles from their path because you’re afraid your child can’t handle them, it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, Bren adds. This is largely a fear-based approach to parenting—and it can backfire:Researchhas found that when parents are anxious about potential threats their children may face in the world, that anxiety can be transmitted to the kids, contributing to their own anxiety and an intolerance of uncertainty. While the term “helicopter parenting” refers to parents who hover over their children, it also means being controlling and overprotective, ready to jump in to help at any moment. But much like with snowplow parenting, “this micromanaging doesn’t help kids learn to pivot, navigate bumps in the road or develop resilience,” says Michele Borba, an educational psychologist based in southern California and author ofThrivers: The Surprising Reasons Why Some Kids Struggle and Others Shine.As a result, “the child becomes dependent and you rob them of agency.” (Nearsightedness is skyrocketing in kids. Sunshine can help.) In addition, research has found thathelicopter parenting by mothers has been linked withgreater alcohol use among their teenage daughters. (To be clear: This study showed a correlation between helicopter parenting and teens’ alcohol use; it didn’t prove causation). And astudy in a 2024 issue ofFrontiers in Psychiatryfound that helicopter parenting was associated with more depression and lower physical self-esteem among college students. The opposite of helicopter and snowplow parenting, free-range parenting (a.k.a., panda parenting) emphasizes kids’ independence and freedom. On the upside, this style can help kids develop self-reliance and confidence. It “allows kids to be kids and go off and do their own thing,” says Bren. But the concern is that kids may end up with too much freedom in areas of life that they’re not ready to handle. That’s why it needs to be based on what a particular child is capable of, Borba says, and there needs to be guidance or “scaffolding,” as she describes it, to help them stay safe. “You need to keep in mind that our children are having different childhoods than we had,” Borba adds. “They’re faster-paced and more fear-based, and kids are digital natives.” Nevertheless,some research suggests that encouraging a child’s independent mobility—defined as the freedom “to travel around their neighborhood or city without adult supervision”—is linked with better physical health and psychological well-being. While we don’t hear about it much these days, tiger parenting still goes on—and has by now been more widely researched than many of these other parenting styles. Popularized in 2011 with the publication of Amy Chua’s memoirBattle Hymn of the Tiger Mother,tiger parenting takes a strict, demanding approach to raising kids, with high expectations and standards and lower levels of emotional support. “It’s resumé- driven and it pushes the child too much in terms of the parents’ goals for the child instead of what drives the child based on who they are,” says Borba. Research has found that tiger parenting is associated withhigher stress responses, as measured by cortisol levels, in kids. What’s more, children who are raised with tiger parenting aremore likely to develop anxiety, as well asdepressive symptoms and a greater sense of alienation from their parents, according to other studies. One of the newest parenting styles on the block, lighthouse parenting, a term coined by Ginsburg, lies in the middle ground—it’s not as strict or controlling as tiger parenting but it’s not as hands-off as free-range parenting either. With lighthouse parenting, the idea is for parents to offer guidance and a consistent source of support from the shoreline, while allowing kids to venture offshore to navigate the waves. “It’s staying where you are [as a parent]—it’s not moving the lighthouse closer and closer to the child,” says Borba. When parents do dive in, it’s because they want to protect their kids from true danger; not because they want or need to control them, Ginsburg notes. “While the name is new, it really is about how to apply what we’ve learned from balanced parenting, which is authoritative parenting,” says Ginsburg, author of the forthcoming bookLighthouse Parenting: Raising Your Child With Loving Guidance for a Lifelong Bond. “If parents serve as loving guides and set appropriate boundaries, kids turn out best and their relationships are the strongest.” Indeed, research has found that authoritative parenting, by any name, is linked withgreater academic achievement and higher self-efficacy, as well ashigher confidence and better emotional self-regulation, among kids and teens.“If you want a child who will succeed and be well-adjusted, you want an authoritative style,” Borba says. Metaphors and monikers aside, certain characteristics are essential to effective parenting. The first is to create a secure style of attachment with your child, says Bren. “The ultimate question is: Do they feel safe, seen, and soothed by me enough to feel secure with me?” she explains. To that end, having emotional attunement, along with warmth, structure, and patience are important, Borba says.Research suggests that parents’ emotional availabilitymay benefit a child’s neurobiological functioning and development. It’s also important for a parent to be able to see the world through their child’s eyes, while helping them feel a sense of individuality and comfort with all their feelings. These are hallmarks of being loved unconditionally. While consistency in parenting is important, Ginsburg says that flexibility is, too: “What changes is the level to which you give guidance. The goal is to foster interdependence and the ability to thrive.” Another perk: These balanced parenting qualities can help foster strong bonds between parents and children. “When you parent with loving guidance,” Ginsburg says, “your child is going to want you in their life forever.” Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2025 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

        "content": "He spoke after taking the presidential oath for a second time at the Capitol. At noon today, Donald Trump took the presidential oath for a second time, capping a historic political comeback to the White House. As he did on the campaign trail, Trump painted a dark picture of America and took aim at President Joe Biden's leadership as his predecessor sat just steps away. \"My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal, and all of these many betrayals that have taken place, and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and indeed their freedom,\" Trump said, promising a \"golden age of America.\" With a flurry of executive orders expected today, President Donald Trump's top advisers, including his incoming Department of Justice leadership, are preparing for a storm of legal challenges to some of the most controversial ones. \"We're going to get sued on all of these things,\" one top Trump adviser said, adding that the volume of litigation is expected to be a full-time job for Trump's DOJ.   Trump has privately told advisers that he believes flooding the zone with executive orders will lead to lawsuits that may be less effective given the volume of actions he plans to take. During Trump's first administration, he faced upwards of 400 lawsuits challenging his actions. His advisers anticipate more than that this time. There will be a team inside the Justice Department that is dedicated just to defending Trump's actions in court, sources said. -ABC News’ Katherine Faulders Thetransition from the Biden White House to the Trump White Houseis well underway and crews are working quickly to make the changes before Trump arrives later this afternoon, but the choices are nearly identical to his first term.   In the Oval Office, gold curtains have returned behind the Resolute Desk, as well as the red-and-beige carpet with green leaves that covered the wood floor. As Trump sits at his desk, the portrait of President Andrew Jackson returned to the wall on his left side, just as it was during his first term. Biden had a portrait of Benjamin Franklin. To Trump’s right, where Biden hung a 1917 flag-decorated Childe Hassam painting, President Abraham Lincoln is now back on display. Other areas of the West Wing still need to be unboxed. In the Cabinet Room is a cardboard box with \"DJT Office Bibles\" written on the side. -ABC News’ Justin Ryan Gomez Members of Congress, officials joining the new administration and tech leaders including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg have congregated for an inauguration luncheon at the Capitol.           Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who chairs the Inaugural committee, is seated between Trump and Vance. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was critical of Trump's inaugural speech, pointing out that he didn't mention his plan to cut taxes on the wealthy. \"In the President’s first term, his only accomplishment was enacting tax cuts that gave eighty-three percent of the benefits to the top one percent while increasing the national debt by $2 trillion,\" she said in a statement. \"While he didn’t say it in his speech, the President campaigned on an extension of those tax cuts being his first priority in the new Congress,\" Pelosi said. \"The American people want us to build an economy from the middle out -- not from the top down.\" Pelosi's statement came as Trump slammed the former speaker in remarks to his supporters at Emancipation Hall. \"She's guilty as hell,\" Trump said of Pelosi over her response to the attack on the U.S. Capitol.

LONDON --Russia and Ukraine exchanged large drone attacks on Sunday night into Monday, with UAVs forcing flight restrictions at three Russian airports and prompting reports of an attack on a major military aviation hub. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed to have shot down 30 Ukrainian drones overnight over western Russian regions -- 14 over Bryansk region, six over Kaluga region, three over Belgorod region, three over Kursk region, two over Ryazan region, and two over Oryol region. Another drone was shot down over the Republic of Tatarstan, the ministry statement said. The capital of Tatarstan, Kazan, is more than 600 miles from the closest Ukrainian-controlled territory. Russia's Rosaviatsia federal air transport agency announced temporary restrictions on flights at the Kazan International Airport and Begishevo Airport -- both in the Tatarstan region. The restrictions were lifted around four hours later. Kazan International Airport said on Telegram the stoppages were intended \"to ensure the safety of civil aircraft flights.\" Three planes were diverted away from Kazan while the restrictions were in place, the airport said. Flights were also restricted at the Izhevsk Airport in the neighboring Udmurt Republic, Rosaviatsia said. Authorities in Tatarstan said drones targeted industrial facilities in the region, Russia's RBC news outlet reported. Officials said all drones were neutralized with no casualties or damage reported, though added that emergency responders were working at the scene, RBC said. Photos and videos posted to social media by residents indicated an attack in the vicinity Kazan. ABC News was unable to immediately verify the footage. Andriy Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation -- which operates as part of the country's Security and Defense Council -- reported \"explosions in Kazan,\" claiming that \"military facilities were attacked by unknown drones.\" Kovalenko noted that the city \"is home to several important aviation enterprises that play a key role in the Russian military-industrial complex,\" among them the aviation plant and a helicopter plant. Kazan also operates an explosives factory manufacturing aerial munitions including Kalibr and Iskander missiles, Kovalenko said. \"Not the first attacks, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to cover the skies of Russia,\" Kovalenko wrote on Telegram. The Kazan Aviation Plant -- a major aviation industrial site -- was among the sensitive sites noted by Kovalenko. The plant was put under European Union sanctions after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with the bloc noting the site \"manufactures and repairs the Tu-160 strategic missile carriers and the TU-22M3M/TU-22M3 long-range bombers.\" The facility also \"produces parts used in the construction of Il-76 strategic airlifters,\" the EU said. Elsewhere, Kaluga governor Vladislav Shapsha said on Telegram that drone debris fell on an industrial site in the region causing a fire, though \"preliminary data\" indicated \"no casualties or damage to infrastructure.\" Bryansk governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram that air defenses shot down four U.S.-made HIMARS missiles and 14 drones over the region on Sunday night, reporting no casualties or damage. Ukraine, meanwhile, said Russia launched 141 drones and one ballistic missile into the country on Sunday night. Ukraine's air force said it downed 93 attack UAVs, with another 47 lost in flight. Two of the drones flew back into Russia airspace, the air force said in a statement posted to Telegram.

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post via AP, Pool)  Flanked by members of Congress from both parties, Trump sat in a high-backed red chair at an ornate desk and began affixing his signature to documents. One act was related to Cabinet duties while another directed that U.S. flags be flown at full staff on Inauguration Day. Trump had bristled at the idea of flags flying at half-staff, as directed by Biden, for 30 days to honor the death of former President Jimmy Carter. Carter died late last month. Trump is joking about his wife’s large hat, saying that she nearly blew away earlier when the two stepped outside to see Biden off. “She almost blew away,” Trump said with a laugh, joking that, “She was being elevated off the ground.” First lady Melania Trump visibly struggled to keep the hat on her head amid wind gusts and the force of the military helicopter that carried Biden from the Capitol.

(Jack Gruber/Pool Photo via AP)   The military airplane taking Biden and his family to a respite in California started taxiing just before 2 p.m. for takeoff from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. Before getting on the plane, Biden spoke at a farewell event on the base with now-former staff members, telling them, “We’re leaving office but we’re not leaving the fight.” It’s a remarkable moment for the new president — moments after being sworn into office, rambling into a long speech of familiar promises, grievances and insults. Trump is holding court at the Capitol’s Emancipation Hall, his vice president and the House speaker looking on, as he talks unscripted for what was expected to be a quick stop to supporters. Instead, he is speaking on a range of topics, a weave he has called it.

(Angelina Katsanis/Pool Photo Photo via AP)  He’s also going longer in his post-inaugural remarks than he did in his inaugural address, which ran for half an hour. The new president read from a teleprompter and was relatively staid in the Capitol Rotunda during his formal address. That speech was short by traditional inaugural address standards. But then he headed to another part of the Capitol and started talking in a more relaxed and jovial way. He didn’t stop for 32 minutes, joking at one point, “I think it’s a better speech than the one I gave upstairs.” Donald Trump, who overcame impeachments, criminal indictments and a pair of assassination attempts to win another term in the White House, was sworn in as the 47th president Monday. “The golden age of America begins right now,” he declared.  After delivering a relatively staid inaugural address reading from a teleprompter, Trump is now unleashing during a freewheeling, off-the-cuff second speech at the Capitol Visitor Center. Trump is angrily railing against his enemies, promising action on what he calls the “J6 hostages,” calling former U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney “a crying lunatic,” and bashing what he calls the “unselect committee of political thugs” that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. He’s also criticizing the pardons Joe Biden issued right before Trump was sworn in and in recent weeks. It’s where rows of National Guard troops took their rest on the hard floors in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Trump is reviving false claims about the House’s Jan. 6 committee that investigated the attack and complaining about Biden’s last-minute pardons for the committee members and staff.

(Al Drago/Pool Photo via AP)  Trump says he decided not to mention the people who have been jailed for their roles in the violent insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, during his inaugural speech but is talking about them now during freewheeling remarks at the visitor center. “I was going to talk about the J6 hostages,” said Trump, who has vowed to pardon those involved in the violence, whom he refers to as “hostages.” He says that action, not words, are what matter, adding: “You’re going to see a lot of action.” President Donald Trump has named an acting defense secretary because his choice to lead the Pentagon, Pete Hegseth, has not yet been confirmed by the Senate. Robert G. Salesses, deputy director of the Pentagon’s Washington Headquarters Service, will fill in, two defense officials said on the condition of anonymity to discuss an announcement that was not yet public. The service includes all of the capitol region support services, including facilities management and the office of general counsel and others that support the military branches and Pentagon leadership. Salesses served as a Marine in the Gulf War, earning a Bronze Star. The appointment was first reported by NBC. Donald Trump has been sworn in as the 47th President of the United States, taking charge as Republicans claim unified control of Washington and set out to reshape the country’s institutions.  In his inaugural address, President Donald Trump declared that “America’s decline is over,” while promising several executive orders on a range of areas from immigration to inflation.  Former President Joe Biden leaves the U.S. Capitol via helicopter after watching his successor, Donald Trump, be sworn in as 47th President of the United States. Joe Biden is boarding a helicopter that will carry him into his post-presidency life — but the aircraft carrying him is no longer known as Marine One. Since Biden is now a former president, he and his wife Jill boarded a chopper technically known as “Nighthawk 46\" despite still having the presidential seal. The Bidens were flying to a farewell ceremony at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, then flying to California. The California flight will be Special Air Mission 46. Trump, who hadn’t yet taken office then, flew on Saturday from Florida to Washington aboard a plane with presidential markings that was known as Special Air Mission 47 People cross into the United States for their appointments to seek asylum made through the CBP One app, Friday, Feb. 2, 2024, in Tijuana, Mexico. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull)  The Trump administration Mondayended use of a border app called CBP Onethat has allowed nearly 1 million people to legally enter the United States with eligibility to work. A notice on the website of Customs and Border Protection on Monday just after Trump was sworn in let users know that the app that had been used to allow migrants to schedule appointments at eight southwest border ports of entry is no longer available. The notice said that existing appointments have been canceled. The move adheres to a promise Trump made during his campaign and will please critics who say it was an overly generous magnet for more people to come to Mexico’s border with the United States.

(AP Photo/Fernando Llano)  The CBP One app had been wildly popular. It is an online lottery system to give appointments to 1,450 people a day at eight border crossings. They enter on immigration “parole,” a presidential authority that Joe Biden used more than any other president since it was introduced in 1952.

Biden is going to Joint Base Andrews for a farewell ceremony with now-former members of his staff. He’ll then fly aboard a military airplane to Santa Ynez, California, to unwind with his family.   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi were among those wishing Trump well in his new term in the White House. Netanyahu predicted “the best days of our alliance are yet to come,” even as he hailed actions Trump took in his first term, including moving the American embassy to Jerusalem. El-Sissi said he’d work with Trump to enhance their countries’ relationship. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, whose Labor government has been under attack by Elon Musk and other Trump allies, also sent his “warmest congratulations.” President Trump, VP Vance, and the first and Second Lady have departed. Former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris have also left. The Trump family is waiting for the remaining former presidents to leave the platform before they are escorted out He is next expected to appear at a signing room ceremony.

(AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson, Pool)  Trump selected opera tenor Christopher Macchio to perform the national anthem during the inauguration. He’s asmaller name than some of the performerswho’ve offered their renditions of “The Star-Spangled Banner” in the past. In 2021, Lady Gaga sang the national anthem for President Joe Biden. In 2013, Beyoncé performed the national anthem and later said she had lip-synced to a taped track for President Barack Obama. In a statement issued by the new White House, Trump says he will again withdraw the United States, a top carbon-polluting nation, from the landmark Paris Climate Agreement, dealing a blow to worldwide efforts to combat global warming and once again distancing the U.S. from its closest allies. The announcement echoed Trump’s actions in 2017 whenhe announced that the U.S. would abandonthe Paris accord, which is aimed at limiting long-term global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. The 2015 Paris Agreement is voluntary and allows nations to provide targets to cut their own emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. Trump did not express intentions to take back the Panama Canal during his campaign but began talking about wanting this vital waterway last month. During his inaugural address, Trump said the spirit of a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter that relinquished control of the canal in 1999 had been violated. He said the waterway should have never been given away and said that “American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly,” and repeated that “China is operating the Panama Canal.” Earlier this month, he said he would not rule out military force to take control of it. ▶ Read more aboutthe Panama Canal treaty Yeshiva University’s President Rabbi Ari Berman speaks as President Donald Trump, Barron Trump and Vice President JD Vance listen during the 60th Presidential Inauguration in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. (Kenny Holston/The New York Times via AP, Pool)  Rabbi Ari Berman delivered the first of several benedictions after Trump delivered his inaugural address. Berman is president of Yeshiva University, a Jewish institution in Manhattan. He is the second Orthodox rabbi to deliver the benediction at a presidential inauguration. At least one prayer has been recited by clergy members at presidential inaugurals since 1937 during President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s second inauguration. Rev. Lorenzo Sewell, pastor of 180 Church Detroit, followed during the second of the benediction, saying, “Heavenly father we are so grateful that you gave our 45th and now our 47th president a millimeter miracle.” A coalition of veterans, public health professionals, teachers, consumer advocates and watchdog groups has filed a legal challenge in federal court against Trump’s special commission on promoting government efficiency. The lawsuit was filed just after Trump’s swearing-in. It seeks an injunction against the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The suit charges that Trump is operating the group without complying with federal transparency laws, and argues that the activities of private commissions must be made public. Trump mentioned DOGE, which is being headed by billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk, in his inauguration speech.

(Kevin Lamarque/Pool Photo via AP)  Trump’s second inaugural speech marked a major departure from his tone the first time he took the Oath of Office. Back in 2017, Trump delivered an inaugural address that put aside the typical optimism and promises of unity with a dark portrait of national life as he spoke of “American Carnage.” “From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this moment on, it’s going to be America first,” he had declared then. Trump finished speaking after about 30 minutes. It was a very short speech by Trump’s standards. His 2024 campaign rally speeches often went on for more than an hour.

(AP Photo/Morry Gash, Pool)       It’s tradition to use a Bible during the presidential oath of office, but it is not required. Only the oath is mandated by the Constitution. Theodore Roosevelt didn’t use a Bible when he was sworn in following the assassination of William McKinley in 1901. John Quincy Adams used a law text for his 1825 inauguration. And, sworn in aboard Air Force One after John Kennedy’s assassination in 1963, Lyndon B. Johnson used a Catholic missal. “Many people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback, but as you see here today, here I am,” he said. “I stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do in America,” he went on, adding: “In America, the impossible is what we do best.” Trump’s enthusiasm for sending astronauts to Mars was shared by some — but not all — Americans in a 2019 AP-NORC poll. About 3 in 10 US adults said that sending astronauts to Mars was “very” or “extremely” important, about one-third said it was “moderately” important, and about 4 in 10 said it was “not too” or “not at all” important.

(Chip Somodevilla/Pool Photo via AP)  Country music star Carrie Underwood is performing “America the Beautiful” at today’s inauguration. “I love our country and am honored to have been asked to sing at the Inauguration and to be a small part of this historic event,” Underwood said in a statement shortly after the news broke. “I am humbled to answer the call at a time when we must all come together in the spirit of unity and looking to the future.” But Underwood has avoided discussing politics across her career,in 2019 telling The Guardian, “I feel like more people try to pin me places politically. I try to stay far out of politics if possible, at least in public, because nobody wins. It’s crazy. Everybody tries to sum everything up and put a bow on it, like it’s black and white. And it’s not like that.” John Coombs, 31, stood about three blocks from the White House and cheered when he heard Trump had taken the oath of office. Coombs drove over from his home in Northern Virginia and said he was leaving to try to beat traffic. “I’m feeling great. I’m excited. I’m looking forward to lots of prosperity and investment in the nation. And hopefully a return to a constitutional way of process,” he said. Coombs said he would like to see the immigration system fixed and streamlined. “The biggest thing is probably going to be the immigration system and the economy. It’s really unfortunate that our immigration system is as broken as it is. It takes way too long for someone who can come and be a benefit to our country to come in,” he said. Trump says he wants to send American astronauts to Mars, saying he “will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars” and “plant the stars and stripes on the planet Mars.” Billionaire Elon Musk of SpaceX threw his hands up in the air as Trump announced the U.S. would plant its flag on Mars. President Donald Trump speaks during the 60th Presidential Inauguration in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. (Chip Somodevilla/Pool Photo via AP)  Trump said “all illegal entry will immediately be halted,” with few details on how he will achieve that. He said he would end the practice of releasing migrants in the United States to pursue asylum, known as “catch-and-release,” but didn’t say how he would pay for the enormous costs of detention. Part of his plan relies on resuming the “Remain in Mexico” policy to make asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for hearings in U.S. immigration court, a hallmark of his first term. The Mexican government has agreed, signaling perhaps one of the most concrete and immediate changes that will be seen at the border. Trump said little about his plans for mass deportation, saying only that he would deport “millions and millions of criminal aliens.” The Rev. Al Sharpton and other Black leaders led a standing-room-only congregation in a passionate and political Martin Luther King Jr. Day as Trump was being sworn in. The timing was no accident. “We want people to see the tale of two cities in one,” Sharpton cried, as Trump was being inaugurated at the Capitol. Sharpton introduced Korey Wise — one of the falsely accused Central Park Five Black defendants whose execution Trump had lobbied for — to cheers from the crowd, and rattled off a series of actions he said Trump had taken against Black Americans and civil rights. “We will fight the next four years no matter what he says,” Sharpton said. “Everything that Dr. King stood for is at risk with this president, this Congress,” Sharpton said. Trump vowed to “defeat what was record inflation.” Inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 after rising steadily in the first 17 months of Biden’s presidency from a low of 0.1% in May 2020. Themost recent datashows that as of December it had fallen to 2.9%. But other historical periods have seen higher inflation, such as a more than 14% rate in 1980, according to the Federal Reserve. Here are a few of the executive orders Trump says he plans to issue on his first day: In his inaugural address, Trump repeated a line he usually brought up during his campaign, saying that immigrants arriving in the country illegally come from prisons and mental institutions. There is no evidence countries are sending their criminals or mentally ill across the border. The speech Trump is delivering sounds a lot like his rally speeches, with plenty of grievance, including references to those who tried to “take my freedom” and the “weaponization of our Justice Department.” Trump, after leaving office, became the first former president to be indicted, convicted and sentenced. But he has long tried to cast his many investigations as politically motivated.

(Kevin Lamarque/Pool Photo via AP)   Trump is laying out his executive orders, starting with declaring a state of emergency on the southern border, which received a standing ovation from all Republicans and a few swing state Democrats, including Reps. Don Davis and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez. Trump marked the fact that his inauguration is occurring on Martin Luther King Jr. Day., saying in his speech that his administration will “strive together to make his dream a reality.” “To the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote. We set records and I will not forget it,” Trump said. “We will make his dream come true,” Trump vowed of the Rev. King.

(Chip Somodevilla/Pool Photo via AP)  Trump referred to the assassination attempt against him, saying he was “saved by God to make America great again,” drawing a standing ovation from Republicans in the room while Democrats, including Biden and Harris, remained seated and still. Trump says the election has given him “a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal” he says has taken place, “and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed their freedom. From this moment on, America’s decline is over.” Speaking just feet from former Biden, Trump is delivering a forceful critique of the federal government, which he says “cannot manage even a simple crisis at home.” He cites the wildfires in California and flooding in North Carolina, crises about which he has repeatedly spread incorrect claims. He also points to “a continuing catalogue of catastrophic events abroad” and illegal immigration. “My election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal,” he said.

        "content": "National Geographic content straight to your inbox—sign up for our popular newsletters here Each January, indulgent and entertaining feasts take place across Scotland and beyond to honour national poet Robert Burns. The first Burns supper was held in 1801, five years after the death of Scotland’s beloved poet, Robert Burns, setting a template that’s remained largely unchanged since: music, poetry, food, whisky. Held each year on or around 25 January (the writer’s birthday), Burns suppers traditionally begin with a reading of his poem, Selkirk Grace, along with a soup such as cullen skink. Next, a platter of haggis is paraded around the room, often accompanied by a bagpiper, before being presented to ‘the addresser’, who then recites Burns’s poem, Address to a Haggis. After several courses and many whisky-fuelled toasts in between, the night is rounded off with a rousing rendition of Auld Lang Syne. Here’s where you can join in: The poet’s favourite howff (haunt),The Globe Innunderstandably makes a huge affair of Burns Night. The 2025 event will include entertainment led by piper Callum Watson, as well as special guests from the Howff Club, a set of local Burns enthusiasts. There’ll also be a five-course feast with all the traditional toasts, including the Toast to the Lassies. 25 January; £65 per person. Given its location, a mile from Glen Garioch Distillery, whisky is naturally a standout feature of the celebrations atMeldrum Househotel. There’s a Glen Garioch cocktail on arrival and a dram is served alongside the haggis, which itself comes doused in a sauce made with the distillery’s Founders Reserve whisky. A Highland dance performance is followed by a lively ceilidh band. 24 and 25 January; £70 per person. Expect a twist on tradition at theUbiquitous Chip’sBeyond Burns event, where performers from the National Theatre of Scotland will present fresh interpretations of the bard’s works. On the menu there’s venison haggis, hogget shoulder with mussel ragu and seaweed broth andArbroath smokie mousse with quail egg. The night isn’t a total snub to tradition, however — after dinner, there’s a ceilidh and a rendition of Auld Lang Syne. 23January; £80 per person. This hotel’s whitewashed exterior comes into its own on Burns Night, when it’s used as a canvas for a huge projected image of the poet to greet guests. The 2025 menu promises haggis with neeps and tatties, plus roast Angus beef with whisky-glazed carrots and, to finish it off, sticky toffee pudding with Drambuie butterscotch and clotted cream ice cream. Guest speakers will include broadcaster Jay Crawford and historian Ian Landles. 25January; £85perperson. Boisdale, the self-proclaimed ‘unofficial Scottish embassy in London’, located in an old Georgian townhouse in Belgravia, will combine its Burns festivities with the 35th anniversary of its opening. A week-long run of dinners will culminate with a Burns extravaganza on 25 January, with a piper to welcome guests and a live band playing traditional Scottish music. There will also be the Address to the Haggis and a five-course menu featuring Cullen skink croquettes, Balmoral estate venison tartare, mini roast haggis, baked halibut with Orkney razor clams, and Scottish shortbread. 20-25 January; £65 per person. The historicGrantley Hall, situated in rolling North Yorkshire countryside, stipulates a dress code that’s in keeping with the stately surroundings: strictly tartan and kilts or black tie. Dinner includes a classic four-course menu of Cullen skink, haggis, neeps and tatties, as well as a whisky cocktail on arrival and a nip of Glenmorangie 12-year-old Lasanta alongside the haggis toast. Throughout the evening there’ll be bagpipe performances, poems, songs and traditional ceilidh dancing. 23 January; £145 per person. Well-heeled and quintessentially English, Marlow might not seem like the most obvious place for a Burns Night celebration – but over atThe Oarsman, Glaswegian chef Scott Smith will be hosting a night where wine, whisky and Scottish food are the focus. The four-course menu includes Stornoway black pudding with tattie scone, trout and Arbroath smokie cullen skink, and Highland Park whisky baba served with Buckfast tonic wine. To drink there are wine pairings from the restaurant’s 300-strong list, plus whisky flights. 23 January; £60 per person. The star of the Burns lunch at thetwo-Michelin-star restaurantof Perth and Kinross’s Glenturret Distillery is the house-made haggis, featuring malted barley and – of course – whisky. It also crops up on tasting menus periodically through the year in various forms, from haggis-stuffed grouse to haggis sandos, but Burns Night is its time to shine. The rest of the menu for this year’s three-course lunch is still to be confirmed, but guests can expect champagne, bagpipes and poetry, alongside a private distillery tour and tasting that includes a dram of 14-year-old limited-release Glenturret whisky. 25 January; £175 per person.

        "content": "Ethics watchdogs and unions accuse DOGE of skirting federal transparency rules. Within minutes of President Donald Trump'sswearing-in on Monday, a handful of ethics watchdogs and public interest groups filed lawsuits against the Trump administration targeting the controversial Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and its outspoken leader, tech billionaire Elon Musk. The flurry of litigation largely accuses the Trump administration of skirting federal transparency rules that require advisory groups like DOGE to disclose its hiring practices and interactions with government bodies. Another suit seeks documents regarding DOGE's interactions with Trump's transition team. The influx of litigation filed as Trump delivered his second inaugural address highlights the unorthodox nature of DOGE, which Trump launched after his election triumph as a means to makecuts to the federal budgetand workforce. Despite its name, DOGE was conceived not as an agency within the federal government, but as an outside commission led by Musk and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy. The most sprawling lawsuit, brought Monday by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington on behalf of a coalition of teachers and veterans unions, challenges the \"creation and secret operation of DOGE\" and asks the federal district court in Washington, D.C., to \"[block] the operation of DOGE until it comes into compliance with the law.\" A separate suit brought by the law firm National Security Counselors accuses DOGE of violating the Federal Advisory Committee Act, a 1972 law that regulates the establishment and operation of federal advisory committees. Under FACA, advisory committees like DOGE are required to hold public meetings, the suit claims. \"Laws have meaning, workers have rights, and real reform requires real accountability,\" an attorney who brought the suit told ABC News in a statement. \"Denying workers a seat at the table is a good way to make bad policy. My co-plaintiff and I are only asking for what the law demands, which is balance.\" A similar lawsuit filed by a union representing thousands of federal employees and a consumer watchdog group accused President Trump of refusing to \"regard DOGE as an advisory committee.\" An 11-page suit brought by the Center for Biological Diversity, a climate-focused advocacy group, seeks a broad array of records from the Office of Management and Budget, including \"all transition materials sent to or received by OMB referencing ... DOGE, Elon Musk, or Vivek Ramaswamy.\" \"We know Musk is bullying civil servants and boasting about gutting nearly every legal safeguard that protects Americans, but who knows what sweetheart deals he's making behind the scenes to enrich himself even further,\" said Kierán Suckling, the group's executive director. \"We're going to find out and we won't leave any stone unturned.\" After winning the election, Trump announced that Musk and Ramaswamy would lead DOGE to provide advice and guidance \"outside of government\" and partner with the White House and OMB to \"drive structural government reform.\" In a joining op-ed in the Wall Street Journal in November, Ramaswamy and Musk said they plan to recommend a \"vast reduction\" of federal regulations, cut government spending and reduce the number of federal employees. Earlier Monday, ABC News and other outlets reported that Ramaswamy wouldstep back from DOGEto run for governor of Ohio. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

In true Sarah Sherman fashion, the rest of the segment devolved into a roast session. Jost endured cutting insults about his anatomy, alleged assistant-creeping tendencies, and a supposed coke habit. The highlight? When Jost, recoiling as Sherman reached for his face, said, \"The last thing I need is you sucking on my nose.\" Sherman quipped back “Suck on your nose? No thanks, I don’t want to be up all night. Because of the cocaine, Colin.\" It was less an interview with the vampire and more of a bloodbath — but in the best way possible.

        "source": "https://nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "Former New York Congresswoman Bella Abzug (second from right) joins some 4,000 ERA supporters to march in New York City in 1980 to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. First proposed nearly a century back and approved by Congress 50 years ago, does the beleaguered constitutional amendment have another chance? “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.” For nearly a century, those 24 words have been the subject of a longstanding battle to win women equal protection under the law. The proposed amendment is simple, but the fight to add the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the U.S. Constitution has been anything but. In his last days in office, President Biden issued an opinion thatdeclaredthe amendment is \"ratified.\" But, importantly, the proclamation doesn't mean the ERA text will immediately get added to the constitution. To understand why, it's helpful to know the long history of the proposed amendment, and the legal hurdles it still faces. The amendment has its roots in the aftermath of the suffrage movement. Some activists were ready to retire afterthe 19th Amendmentwas finally passed in 1920, but Alice Paul was determined to keep fighting for the entirety of thewomen’s rights programlaid out by founding suffragists in 1848. “We always had perfect loyalty to the whole program and, if we could continue, we knew that the thing must extend to get thewholeprogram a reality,” shesaidin a 1972 oral history. Activist Alice Paul pushed for the Equal Rights Amendment after the 19th Amendment secured voting rights for American women. In 1923, Paul announced plans to develop and champion aconstitutional amendmentguaranteeing equal protection to both sexes. She named it after women’s rights pioneer Lucretia Mott. It was introduced in the 68th Congress in December of that year by Representative Daniel Read Anthony, Jr. and later revised and renamed after Paul. The concept hit roadblocks from the start. Many came from other women’s rights activists, who feared the amendment might endangerhard-fought lawsthat protected women workers. Those concerns, and split opinions on women’s rights, haunted the amendment for nearly 50 years. The ERA was introduced in Congress over and over again, but despite tantalizing victories, like public hearings and its passage in the Senate in 1946, it was never adopted. Meanwhile, the women’s rights movement changed dramatically as old-guard suffragists passed the torch to new activists. Paul continued her tireless advocacy for decades. She finally found the support she needed in the late 1960s, when second-wave feministshelped push ittoward passage. Finally, in 1972, the ERA passed both chambers of Congress. (Here's how women around the world are taking charge of their futures.) The hard work wasn’t over yet. To be added to the Constitution, three-quarters of the states had to ratify it within the seven-year deadline attached by Congress. But though it enjoyedbroad popular supportand was even part of both the Democratic National Convention and the Republican National Convention’s national platforms from the 1940s on, the ERA fell victim to political shifts. Backlash to the women’s movement and the increasing conservatism of the Republican Party gave fuel toPhyllis Schlafly, an activist who opposed feminism and the amendment. Though legislators extended the deadline to 1982, the savvy opposition of Schlafly and her allies slowed and even stopped progress in several states. The Republican Party removed the ERA from its platform, and five states voted to rescind their ratifications in the 1970s. The amendment missed its 1982 deadline only three states shy of ratification. But is the amendment really dead? Maybe not. Nevada and Illinoisratifiedit in 2017 and 2018, leaving it just one state shy of the majority—until Virginia’s General Assemblypassed the ERAin January 2020. Given that the seven-yearratification deadline has passed, though, it could face significant legal hurdles even with another ratification. Supreme Court precedent states that amendments must be ratified in a “contemporaneous” timeframe. On the other hand, the 27th Amendment, which prohibits Congress from handing itself a bump in pay before an election, wassuggested and writtenby James Madison more than two centuries before its ratification in 1992. And it’s not clear how the states that rescinded their ratifications would be handled even if Congress agrees to accept the latecomers. (Essay: Why it's time for women to demand equality.) This is why, even with President Biden's recent declaration, the fate of the amendment is still uncertain. Though a constitutional amendment could never address all disparities, the amendment’s supporterssayit could provide clearer definitions of gender discrimination and prevent a rollback of women’s rights to things like abortion. Despite recent successes, however, the ERA’s future is still uncertain—and the most contentious phase of its century-long history could still lie ahead.

        "content": "10 years in prison is possible. Cell phones are magnets for our attention, but you can, of course, face significant legal jeopardy for giving them that attention. Just ask the \"safety driver\" of an Uber self-driving vehicle, which hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona in 2018. According to authorities, the driver waswatchingThe Voiceon Hulujust before the crash—and was then charged with negligent homicide. These kinds of cases are always tragic because they feel so easily avoidable, but they also happen with enough regularity that it's easy to tune them out. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,3,308 people were killed by distracted drivers in 2022 alone—and \"texting is the most alarming distraction.\" That's why states continue to crack down on cell phone use while driving. AColorado lawthat went into effect on January 1, for instance, bans a driver from using any mobile electronic device unless it is hands-free. Thirty US states now have such bans in place. But a trial that wrapped up in New Jersey this week caught my attention, because it is one of the sadder and stranger examples of cell phone-mediated distraction while in a vehicle. A young girl died, and a 28-year-old woman is probably going to jail, but this is not your typical tale of texting while driving. Texting was involved—34 times, in fact—but driving had nothing to do with what happened. The trial was about an incident in Franklin Township, New Jersey, on July 17, 2023, when a 6-year-old girl named Fajr Williams got on a bus to attend a summer program. Williams had disabilities and was confined to her wheelchair. The bus had a spot for anchoring wheelchairs to the ground, and it had a ride-along bus monitor named Amanda Davila, 28, who was supposed to watch and assist kids like Williams. According to state prosecutors, Williams was properly strapped into her wheelchair and had been taken down to the bus by her older sister. Williams was then loaded onto the bus, but her chair was allegedly not attached to the floor correctly, nor were the proper seatbelts used. As a result, while the bus drove its route to school that morning, Williams began to slide down the seat of her wheelchair. (She could not control her trunk movements normally, and so she was unable to sit back up.) At some point in the ride, she slid low enough that her chair's own four-point harness, which was meant to keep her upright, began to choke her. By the time the bus arrived at school, William had been strangled to death. Investigators focused on the actions of Davila, who was supposed to keep Williams within view. Instead, authorities say, video from inside the bus showed: ...that defendant sat in front of the victim instead of across the aisle from her and that defendant used her cell phone with ear buds to scroll through Instagram, listen to Apple music, and send/receive 34 text messages during the bus ride instead of checking on the victim. Testimony revealed that defendant received six years of safety trainings that emphasized a no-cellphone and no-earbuds policy. The state charged Davila with both manslaughter and child endangerment, and she could have faced a couple of decades in prison. The trial itself was raw. According to alocal report from NBC, \"The video played in court was so painful to watch for the victim's family, her father had to leave the courtroom while jurors watched little Fajr struggling to breathe.\" But Davila wasn't going to take complete blame. \"I made a mistake, but you guys are trying to put me away for 10 to 20 years—on a mistake,\" she said, going on to argue that the bus company had not in fact banned cell phone use. The New York Timesspoke to her lawyer, who said that it \"wasn’t discouraged for her to be on her phone\" and that the bus company actually used the phone to communicate with Davila and even asked her to give her number to parents. Davila also claimed that some of the straps and hooks on her bus weren't working—and that she wasn't properly trained to use them anyway. (The state put great emphasis on the regular training sessions that the bus company gave to employees.) But she admitted that she should have been sitting in the back, with her eyes on the students with disabilities. On January 13, 2025, after a weeklong trial, Davila received a split decision. She was cleared on the more serious manslaughter charge but was found guilty of child endangerment and faces the possibility of a decade in jail when she is sentenced in March.

        "content": "Over 1,000 people have pleaded guilty in the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. President Donald Trump is preparing to issue a sweeping series of pardons for defendants charged in the Jan. 6, 2021,attack on the U.S. Capitol, including commuting the prison sentences of hundreds of his supporters who have been convicted of violent attacks against law enforcement, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News. The planned commutations for those who attacked police goes well beyond what many of his allies anticipated he would be prepared to extend to the Jan. 6 defendants -- and paves the way for potentially hundreds of supporters, some sentenced to years behind bars for vicious assaults on police -- to be released in the coming days. An incoming senior White House official did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News. In addition to the commutations, Trump plans to extend full pardons to his supporters who were not charged with engaging in violence on Jan. 6. Sources tell ABC News that some of Trump's top advisers have been pushing him for days to issue these sweeping pardons. Sources also caution that until Trump formally signs the pardon paperwork, it's possible that the expected language could change or be scaled back. Sources tell ABC News that hundreds of individuals currently serving prison time for violent offenses they committed on Jan. 6 will be freed as a result -- and the commutations will likely extend to two of the most high-profile defendants charged in connection with the attack, Oath Keepers Founder Stewart Rhodes and Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio. The two received prison sentences of 18 years and 22 years, respectively, following their convictions for leading members of their respective groups in a seditious conspiracy to thwart the lawful transfer of power. Trump is expected to further direct the incoming attorney general to move to dismiss all pending indictments against Jan. 6 defendants who have not yet had their cases fully adjudicated, which would shutter roughly 470 ongoing cases, according to recently released numbers by the District of Columbia U.S. Attorney's Office. Current and former DOJ officials have expressed alarm over the potential that Trump would hand down pardons -- or otherwise free -- violent offenders, citing the potential risk they could seek to target the prosecutors who oversaw their cases, the judges who sentenced them to periods of incarceration, or witnesses who may have testified against them. Trump teased the pardons Sunday at his victory rally at Capital One Arena, telling his supporters that they will be \"very happy\" with his decision. \"Tomorrow, everybody in this very large arena will be very happy with my decision on the J6 hostages,\" Trump said \"Very happy. I think you'll be very, very happy. I would say about 99.9% in this beautiful arena.\" A violent mob of pro-Trump protesters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, fighting with officers, breaking into offices and destroying property. After the attack on the U.S. Capitol by rioters seeking to overturn the 2020 election, more than 1,580 people were charged criminally in federal court, according to the Department of Justice. Over 1,000 have pleaded guilty. Trump's team had drafted a list of potential pardons for Jan. 6 defendants to issue on Day 1, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News on Sunday. Of the nearly 1,600 individuals have faced charges associated with the Capitol attack, according to figures released by the U.S. Attorney's Office, 608 individuals have faced charges for assaulting, resisting or interfering with law enforcement trying to protect the complex that day, the office said. Approximately 140 law enforcement officers were injured during the riot, the DOJ has said. The U.S. Attorney's Office said it is evaluating whether to bring charges in roughly 200 cases that have been referred to them by the FBI, about 60 of which involve potential felony charges involving allegations of assault or impeding law enforcement. Trump said last Marchthat he was \"inclined to pardon many\" of the rioters. At least 221 individuals have been found guilty at contested trials in U.S. District Court, the DOJ said. Another 40 individuals have been convicted following an agreed-upon set of facts presented to and accepted by the Court. Outgoing President Joe Biden on Mondayissued preemptive pardonsto potential targets of the incoming Trump administration, including lawmakers who served on the House Jan. 6 Committee. Trump, in his 2024 campaign, repeatedly vowed \"retribution\" on his political enemies, specifically singling out lawmakers like Liz Cheney, who investigated the attack on the Capitol. Trump said Cheney and other committee members should be put in jail. ABC News' Lalee Ibssa and Meredith Deliso contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Learn more:Read ourBread Savings review  While we have seen CD rates drop after the Fed cut rates for the second consecutive time on November 7, some high-yield savings rates have held steady. In the short term, these rates should hold steady or slightly drop. However, future rate cuts may force banks to drop savings rates. It might be a good time to consider acertificate of deposit. You can lock in a rate with a CD and ensure a solid rate of return, as opposed to your savings account, which might see a steady rate decline. Major national banks generally offer minuscule APYs compared to some of the top institutions on our list. For example, Bank of America, Chase Bank, and Wells Fargo offer a measly APY of 0.01% on their savings accounts, whereas most of the options listed above are over 5%. Large banks don’t rely on the money consumers deposit into their savings accounts the way smaller banks do. Huge financial institutions make their money from interest paid on loans, fees, and securities. Smaller banks and online fintechs are continuously looking for ways to draw in new customers, and offering competitive APYs on their deposit accounts is a great incentive. Additionally, online banks generally have fewer upfront costs, so they can offer better rates to their customers. That being said, a few major banks still offer decent rates on savings accounts. Here are several national banks and their savings account APYs as compared to the best on our list: Ahigh-yield savings accountworks just like atraditional savings account. It’s a deposit account at a credit union or bank that you can use for saving and earning interest on your money. The main difference is that the high-yield savings account offers a much higher APY on the money you keep in your account. Click the drop-downs to learn more about common HYSA terms: The most recent rates from the FDIC put the national savings APY average at 0.46%, while there are many high-yield savings accounts that offer a 4.00% APY or higher. Some financial institutions charge a monthly fee to cover the administrative costs of providing a savings account. These fees can often be waived by meeting certain requirements, such as maintaining a minimum balance or linking a checking account. However, fees can easily wipe away your interest earnings, so choosing an account that charges minimal or no fees is important, if possible. You may be required to deposit a minimum amount of money to open a high-yield savings account. Depending on the account, the amount can range from $0 to $1,000 or more. It’s also common for high-yield savings account rates to be tiered, meaning higher rates are available for higher balances. Always check the balance requirements of an account to find out if you need to meet a certain threshold to earn the advertised rate. \"One trick I use is to have multiple high-yield savings accounts. Then, as rates fluctuate between them, I move my money around to the account with the best APY. This has helped me earn hundreds in interest over the years.\"—Kristy Snyder, Fortune Recommends contributor When you deposit money in a high-yield savings account, your savings will grow thanks to the magic ofcompound interest. This means you’ll earn interest on the principal balance in your account and any interest you earned previously. For example, if you deposited $100 in your account and earned $10 in interest over the past few months, you will earn interest on the entire $110. The APY on your account can and likely will fluctuate any time the Fed raises or decreases the federal funds rate. That’s the interest rate banks charge one another to borrow money, and your bank may be inclined to raise or lower rates on its financial products based on these changes. The interest you’d earn on a $10,000 deposit depends on the annual percentage yield and frequency of compounding. For example, if you deposited $10,000 into a high-yield savings account that earns 5% APY—and didn’t make any other contributions—you’d have a total balance of $10,500 at the end of one year, assuming the interest compounds annually. If it compounds daily, you’d have a bit more: $10,512.67. The rate at which your interest compounds (daily, weekly, monthly, or annually) will depend on the financial institution. If you’re considering putting your money in a high-yield savings account, there are a few key benefits and drawbacks to be aware of.  One of the main advantages of high-yield savings accounts is that they typically offer interest rates well above the national average. Currently, the national average APY for a traditional savings account sits at 0.43%, whereas some of the high-yield accounts on our list boast rates as high as 5.00%. A high-yield savings account also provides greater security than some other investment options. Most high-yield accounts are FDIC- or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)-insured, meaning that your deposits are protected up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution in the event of abank failure. Meanwhile, you usually won’t earn as much in a savings account as you would by investing your money in the market, even with a high-yield account. Even so, high-yield savings accounts are sensitive to changes in the economy, which means that your APY can increase or decrease at the discretion of your bank. There may also be a cap on your monthly withdrawals. Your financial institution may limit the number of withdrawals you can make each month. You may be charged a fee for each additional transaction if you exceed the limit. High-yield savings accounts can be an effective savings vehicle for savers with many different types of goals. A fewcommon uses for high-yield saving accountsinclude: Choosing the right high-yield savings account will require you to think carefully about your financial habits, preferences, and goals so that you can select the account that best suits your needs. The APY is the interest you can expect to earn on the money you keep in your account for one year. While this percentage may fluctuate depending on your bank and the economy's health, you’ll want to give your savings the greatest chance of growing and earning as much compound interest as possible. The FDIC regularly publishesaverage national ratesfor various accounts, including high-yield savings accounts, so this is a trustworthy resource to use when shopping around for rates. Ideally, a lucrative high-yield savings account will offer a savings rate of at least 10 times that rate. Many, but not all, high-yield savings accounts require a minimum deposit to open your account. This figure can vary widely across financial institutions, with some requiring no minimum deposit and others requiring a minimum deposit well into the thousands. If you’re a new saver, you may not be able to opt for an account requiring a higher minimum deposit. Certain accounts may chargefeesfor maintaining your account, transferring funds, and more. An excessive fee structure can eat into your balance if you’re not keeping close tabs on your account. Weigh the different fees you could become responsible for and determine if the perks that come with the account outweigh potential penalties down the line. Not all high-yield savings accounts will come with physical branch access or a large ATM network. If you’re looking for an account that will provide you with face-to-face support and easy access to your funds, double-check that the financial institution you’re considering banking with has locations and ATMs in your area. If you prefer to do your banking on your desktop or phone, explore the financial institution’s online and mobile platforms before opening an account. Read Apple App Store and Google Play reviews to learn more about the digital platforms and tools available to you and what kinds of features and services are available on those platforms. Lastly, it’s important to know how to contact a representative if you have questions or issues related to your account. Some financial institutions take a digital-first approach and don’t offer easy access to a real human. Others prefer a phone call over chat or email options. Make sure an account’s customer service options align with how you like to communicate. Ready to open an account? Here’s what to do: High-yield savings accounts differ from other types of deposit accounts in a few key ways: The primary difference between a high-yield savings account and a traditionalsavings accountlies in their interest rates. High-yield savings accounts offer significantly higher interest rates compared to traditional savings accounts, which means that the money saved in a high-yield account grows faster. In some cases, high-yield accounts might come with more restrictions, such as limitations on the number of withdrawals and higher minimum balance requirements. High-yield savings accounts are similar to traditional savings accounts, with the key difference being that high-yield accounts typically offer a more generous APY. Theydiffer from CDsin that high-yield savings accounts preserve access to your funds, while CDs require that you commit to locking up your funds for a fixed term if you hope to avoid a penalty. High-yield savings accounts are similar toMMAsin that you’ll earn interest on your balance and can easily access your funds. One key difference between the two account types is that you may need to deposit and maintain a certain balance to open an MMA and, in some cases, the higher the balance, the higher your rate may be. The Fortune Recommends™ team collaborated with industry leader Curinos to bring you savings accounts with the highest rates from around the country. The rates in this article only cover online and brick-and-mortar banks and do not include credit unions. For theeditors' picks, we compared more than 60 online savings accounts and specifically looked for accounts available to customers in the United States regardless of where they’re located, subject to the terms of each account.Our methodologyranked each account in these core categories: Yes, if the account is at a bank or credit union insured by the FDIC or the NCUA, respectively. TheFDIC insures banksup to $250,000 per depositor, per bank, for each account ownership category. Credit unions are insured by the NCUA, which offers coverage up to $250,000 per share owner, per insured credit union, for each account ownership category. If you choose to use a high-yield savings account, you should be aware of the tax implications that come with it. The IRS considers interest earned on the money in your account taxable interest. Your financial institution will typically send you a 1099-INT statement for any interest earned over $10, and the amount you owe will depend on how much interest you’ve earned and your tax bracket. Individual banks set savings rates loosely based on thefederal funds rate—the interest rate that banks charge other banks when they lend one another money, usually overnight or for a few days. When theFed hikes rates, this can raise the cost of borrowing and motivate banks to raise their APYs to attract new customers. The interest rate is the percentage of your account balance that the bank pays you in interest over the course of a year, not factoring in the effects of compounding. APY, on the other hand, considers the interest compounding frequency. Therefore, APY gives you a more accurate picture of your actual earnings over a year. If you put $50,000 into a high-yield savings account with an APY of 5%, you could earn $2,500 in just a year. Compare this with a regular savings account: If the APY is 0.046%, you'll earn just $230 in the same time frame. Note that APYs can change at any time. That depends on when you'll need your money. CDs often yield higher interest rates than savings accounts, but you have to lock your money up for the designated term length to earn that rate. Savings accounts are a better option if you know you'll need access to your money, such as for an emergency fund or another short-term savings goal. According to federal law, high-yield savings accounts allow you to make withdrawals or transfer funds out of your account up to six times per month without paying any fees. However, this rule was loosened in 2020 during the coronavirus outbreak, and customers can now make an unlimited number of transfers and withdrawals from their savings accounts.

A group of scientists and students gingerly made their way, using canes or a helping hand to guide them. For those who couldn’t make the trek, a drone brought the lake — blue and narrow — into view. The field trip was designed to illustrate the challenges disabled researchers often face and how barriers can be overcome. “Just because you can’t do it like someone else doesn’t mean you can’t do it,” said Anita Marshall, a University of Florida geologist leading the outing. The group included scientists withsight, hearing and mobility disabilities. Marshall’s organization ran the field trip to the lake along theSan Andreas Fault, outside of San Bernadino. Her group — the International Association for Geoscience Diversity — and others are working to improve access to field and lab work so that those with disabilities feel welcome and stay.

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun)  Taormina Lepore, a Western Michigan University paleontologist who went on the trip, said scientists tend to value a single, traditional way of getting things done. At Lost Lake, everyone got a view — even if they couldn’t physically get there. “It’s really about empathy, as much as it is about science,” said Lepore, who also researches science education.  Disabled people make up about 3% of the science, technology, engineering and math workforce, according to 2021 data from the National Science Foundation. Scientists with disabilities say that’s in part because labs, classrooms and field sites aren’t designed to accommodate them. Students and faculty are still told that they can’t work in a lab or do research safely, said Mark Leddy, who formerly managed disability-related grants for the National Science Foundation. The Americans with Disabilities Act, passed in 1990, sets minimum regulations for new buildings and labs, including ramps and wheelchair-accessible walkways.

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun)  But modifying older labs can be a complicated and lengthy process. Alyssa Paparella is working on her doctorate in biology at Baylor College of Medicine and founded an online community for disabled scientists. She said a science building at one of her former schools had no automatic buttons to open doors. “What is that saying about who you want actually working in the laboratories?” she said. “That’s the front door that they’re not even able to get in.” Leddy said researchers with disabilities are invaluable because of their life experiences. They have to constantly come up with creative ways to get past barriers in their lives — a problem-solving skill that’s indispensable in a lab. “If they don’t feel welcome, if they don’t get access, then how can they contribute that talent?” Leddy said. Venu Varanasi, a biomaterials engineer at the University of Texas at Arlington who has low vision, prints out signage using high-contrast color combinations and encourages his students to keep floors and counters clutter-free so he can navigate the lab more easily. He said those modifications also keep accidents to a minimum for non-disabled students.

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun)  “When you realize that you have a person with a disability, you have an opportunity, not a problem,” he said. At Purdue University in Indiana, engineering professor Brad Duerstock helped design an accessible biomedical lab years ago with support from the school and a National Institutes of Health grant, removing cabinets under sinks and fume hoods so that wheelchairs can easily pull up. The cost of making a lab more accessible varies depending on how extensive the changes are, Duerstock said. Some schools set aside money for improvements and science organizations can offer grants.

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun)  On the California geology field trip, the group explored the lake carved into the landscape by the San Andreas Fault, where the grating of two tectonic plates can cause earthquakes. The group included rock enthusiasts at all different stages of their careers. A handful were students. Others were professors, eager to explore the outdoors in a group they could trust to look after them. Central Connecticut State University professor Jennifer Piatek, who uses a wheelchair, saw the lake through drone footage and used a pocket lens to examine rocks brought back by other participants. She said it was nice to be part of a community that anticipated her needs. For example, their bus pulled forward to park at a flatter location to make it easier for her to get off. You can learn a lot from images and maps, “but really you need to get to the space to be in it,” said Piatek, who studies planetary geology.

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun)  Lepore, a neurodivergent person with low vision, scanned rocks using an artificial intelligence app that described their color and shape out loud. “Nature is not inherently accessible,” she said. “Nature just doesn’t have ramps and the kinds of things that we might wish it had. But there are so many workarounds and ways that we as geoscientists can make things truly open.” Bushra Hussaini uses tips from the field trips to support interns and volunteers with disabilities at New York’s American Museum of Natural History, where she works. She said the supportive community of geologists is what keeps her coming back. “We learn from each other and we help each other,” she said.

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun)  Before heading out, Marshall urged the participants to ask for a hand or a shoulder to lean on if needed. She and others from the organization have been leading field trips every year as an offshoot from the Geological Society of America’s annual meeting. As a doctoral student, Marshall would go on field trips with her peers only to wait back in the van, frustrated, because the organizers hadn’t thought about how to accommodate her disabilities. She wants things to be different for the next generation of scientists. “The whole point of these little day trips is to just plant that seed out there,” Marshall said, “that there’s another way forward.” AP video journalist Eugene Garcia contributed to this report.

Palestinian residents began returning to their homes in parts of the Gaza Strip early Sunday as a long-awaited ceasefire began. The truce, which started at 11:15 a.m. local time, is a first step toward ultimately ending the conflict and returning nearly 100 hostages abducted in the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack that triggered it. Aerial footage on Sunday showed the devastation caused to the city of Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip following 15 months of fighting between Israel and Hamas.

(AP Photo/Mariam Dagga)                           KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Evenbefore the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamaswas fully in place on Sunday, Palestinians inthe war-battered Gaza Stripbegan to return to the remains of the homes they had evacuated during the 15-month war. Majida Abu Jarad made quick work of packing the contents of her family’s temporary lodging in the sprawling tent city of Muwasi, just north of the strip’s southern border with Egypt. At the start of the war, they were forced to flee their house in Gaza’s northern town of Beit Hanoun, where they used to gather around the kitchen table or on the roof on summer evenings amid the scent of roses and jasmine. The house from those fond memories is gone, and for the past year, Abu Jarad, her husband and their six daughters have trekked the length of the Gaza Strip, following one evacuation order after another by the Israeli military. Aerial footage on Sunday showed the devastation caused to the city of Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip following 15 months of fighting between Israel and Hamas. Israeli bombardment and ground operations have transformed entire neighbourhoods in several cities in the enclave into rubble-strewn wastelands, with blackened shells of buildings and mounds of debris stretching away in all directions. Seven times they fled, she said, and each time, their lives became more unrecognizable to them as they crowded with strangers to sleep in a school classroom, searching for water in a vast tent camp or sleeping on the street. Now the family is preparing to begin the trek home — or to whatever remains of it — and to reunite with relatives who remained in the north. “As soon as they said that the truce would start on Sunday, we started packing our bags and deciding what we would take, not caring that we would still be living in tents,” Abu Jarad said.  The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. The Israeli military bombardment that followed the attack has flattened large swaths of Gaza and displaced 1.9 million of its 2.3 million residents. Over 46,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which says women and children make up more than half the fatalities but does not distinguish between civilians and fighters. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Displaced Palestinians leave parts of Khan Younis as they go back to their homes in Rafah, following a ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel, in Gaza Strip, Sunday, Jan. 19, 2025. (AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi)  Even before the ceasefire officially took effect — and as tank shelling continued overnight and into the morning — many Palestinians began trekking through the wreckage to reach their homes, some on foot and others hauling their belongings on donkey carts. “They’re returning to retrieve their loved ones under the rubble,” said Mohamed Mahdi, a displaced Palestinian and father of two. He was forced to leave his three-story home in Gaza City’s southeastern Zaytoun neighborhood a few months ago. Mahdi managed to reach his home Sunday morning, walking amid the rubble from western Gaza. On the road he said he saw the Hamas-run police force being deployed to the streets in Gaza City, helping people returning to their homes.

(AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi)  Despite the vast scale of the destruction and uncertain prospects for rebuilding, “people were celebrating,” he said. “They started clearing the streets and removing the rubble of their homes. It’s a moment they’ve waited for for 15 months.” Um Saber, a 48-year-old widow and mother of six, returned to her hometown of Beit Lahiya. She asked to be identified only by her honorific, meaning “mother of Saber,” out of safety concerns. Speaking by phone, she said her family had found bodies in the street as they trekked home, some of which appeared to have been lying in the open for weeks. When they reached Beit Lahiya, they found their home and much of the surrounding area reduced to rubble, she said. Some families immediately began digging through the debris in search of missing loved ones. Others began trying to clear areas where they could set up tents. Um Saber said she also found the area’s Kamal Adwan Hospital “completely destroyed.” “It’s no longer a hospital at all,” she said. “They destroyed everything.” Thehospital has been hit multiple timesby Israeli forces waging an offensive in largely isolated northern Gaza against Hamas fighters it says have regrouped. Displaced Palestinians return to Rafah, as a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas went into effect, in Rafah, Gaza Strip, Sunday, Jan. 19, 2025. (AP Photo/Mariam Dagga)  The military has claimed thatHamas militants operate inside Kamal Adwan, which hospital officials have denied. In Gaza’s southern city of Rafah, residents returned to find massive destruction across the city that was once a hub for displaced families fleeing Israel’s bombardment elsewhere. Some found human remains amid the rubble of houses and the streets. “It’s an indescribable scene. It’s like you see in a Hollywood horror movie,” said Mohamed Abu Taha, a Rafah resident, speaking to The Associated Press as he and his brother were inspecting his family home. “Flattened houses, human remains, skulls and other body parts, in the street and in the rubble.” He shared footage of piles of rubble that he said had been his family’s house. “I want to know how they destroyed our home.” The families’ return to their homes comes amid looming uncertainty about whether the ceasefire deal will bring more than a temporary halt to the fighting, who will govern the enclave and how it will be rebuilt. Not all families will be able to return home immediately. Under the terms of the deal, returning displaced people will only be able to cross the Netzarim corridor from south to north beginning seven days into the ceasefire. Displaced Palestinians, some armed, return to Rafah, as a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas went into effect, in Rafah, Gaza Strip, Sunday, Jan. 19, 2025. (AP Photo/Mariam Dagga)  At that point, the agreement says civilians would be allowed to cross into the north on foot without being searched, while a private company to be agreed upon by Israel and the mediators would search vehicles. “We hope that the ceasefire will continue (and be) permanent, so that we can return to our homes and our children can return to their schools,” Rami Nofal, a displaced man from Gaza City, said from his shelter in the central city of Deir al-Balah. Those who do return may face a long wait to rebuild their houses. The United Nations has said that reconstructioncould take more than 350 yearsif Gaza remains under an Israeli blockade. Using satellite data, the United Nations estimated last month that 69% of the structures in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, including more than 245,000 homes. With over 100 trucks working full time, it would take more than 15 years just to clear the rubble away. But for many families, the immediate relief overrode fears about the future. “We will remain in a tent, but the difference is that the bleeding will stop, the fear will stop, and we will sleep reassured,” Abu Jarad said. —— Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "content": "EC has also requested access to information on how X moderates and amplifies content. Brussels has ordered Elon Musk to fully disclose recent changes made to recommendations on X, stepping up an investigation into the role of the social media platform in European politics. The expanded probe by the European Commission, announced on Friday, requires X to hand over internal documents regarding its recommendation algorithm. The Commission also issued a “retention order” for all relevant documents relating to how the algorithm could be amended in future. In addition, the EU regulator requested access to information on how the social media network moderates and amplifies content. The move follows complaints from politicians in Germany that X’s algorithm is promoting content by the far right ahead of the country’s February 23 elections. Musk has come out in favour of Alternative for Germany (AfD), arguing that it will save Europe’s largest nation from “economic and cultural collapse.” The German domestic intelligence service has designated parts of the AfD as right-wing extremist. Speaking on Friday, German chancellor Olaf Scholz toughened his language towards the world’s richest man, describing Musk’s support for the AfD as “completely unacceptable.” The party is currently second place in the polls with around 20 percent support, ahead of Scholz’s Social Democrats and behind the opposition Christian Democratic Union. Earlier in the week, Germany’s defence ministry and foreign ministry said they were suspending their activity on X, with the defence ministry saying it had become increasingly “unhappy” with the platform. When asked if the expanded probe was a response to a discussion Musk conducted last week with AfD co-leader Alice Weidel, in which she was given free rein to promote her party’s platform and make false claims about Adolf Hitler, a Commission spokesperson said the new request helped “us monitor systems around all these events taking place.” However, he said it was “completely independent of any political considerations or any specific events.” “We are committed to ensuring that every platform operating in the EU respects our legislation, which aims to make the online environment fair, safe, and democratic for all European citizens,” said Henna Virkkunen, the Commission’s digital chief. X did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Commission had been under recent political pressure to be tough on Musk’s X ahead of the Weidel interview. Last week Damian Boeselager, member of the European parliament, wrote to Virkkunnen to demand a probe into whether the social media platform’s use of algorithms met the EU’s transparency requirements. “There are allegations that Musk is boosting his own tweets,” Boeselager told the Financial Times last week. “The guy can be crazy but it is unfair if he’s amplifying who must listen to him.” This story was updated shortly after publication with additional details. © 2025 The Financial Times Ltd.All rights reserved.Not to be redistributed, copied, or modified in any way.

        "content": "National Geographic content straight to your inbox—sign up for our popular newsletters here Sometimes getting sleep in a hotel is an actual science. Try these doctor-approved tactics to make travel more restful. Whether you’re traveling for leisure or for work, it can be hard to believe that hotels are in the business of sleep. Between uncomfortable beds, noisy air conditioners, slamming doors, and loud upstairs guests, rest can be a hard thing to achieve while away from home. Dr. Rebecca Robbins, assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and an associate scientist at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, knows the importance of sleep. Her research aims to encourage behavioral changes to improve sleep and circadian health, so it was only natural that she became interested in the hotel experience. In a2020 paperpublished in Tourism and Hospitality Research, Robbins and her colleagues found that only one in three travelers reported being satisfiedwith their sleep while on the road, but sleep satisfaction whiletraveling was a significant predictor of overallguest satisfaction. With sleep tourism on the rise, and proof that hotels are beginning to take sleep more seriously, Robbins is now Hilton's sleep expert, helping to provide sleep strategies, including bedroom designs and hostingsleep retreats. Additionally she was consulted for Royal Sonesta'sBenjamin Hotel’sRest and Renewprogram.Here are some of her evidence-based tips for getting some rest while traveling. “The truth is that when we are in an unfamiliar environment, we fundamentally have a harder time unwinding,” says Robbins. When we’re at home, our bodies relax more easily. Whether it’s new sounds or smells, our brains are on high-alert and scanning the hotel room as unfamiliar terrain. Smells with a positive association are scientifically proven to trigger a sense of well-being. In 2024, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine researchers and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center published astudythat showed familiar scents helped to break negative thought-cycles and overcome depression. Soothing sounds are similarly powerful in easing our minds and promoting relaxation. While there are several machines that replicate the sounds of nature — a babbling brook or rainstorm is known to ease our nervous systems — white noise has also been proven to be beneficial for sleeping in noisy environments. Whether it’s smells or sounds, find ways to bring the sensory familiarity of home to your hotel room. Candles are a hard no in hotel rooms, so pack a favorite perfume, lotion, or essential oil that can supplement a warm shower. Part of the Royal Sonesta’s Rest and Renew program includes a selection of white noise machines, but if your hotel hasn’t hopped on the sleep tourism bandwagon, you can bring your own portable sound machine. We don’t always travel for leisure. The trip may involve difficult family matters or work stress, but typically the things that are keeping us from falling asleep are not ones that you can act on at that moment. We’ve all heard about the benefits of a gratitude journal, but don’t underestimate the power of the worry journal. “The biggest impediments to our ability to fall asleep is a busy mind,” says Robbins. It’s not only strange noises coming from your neighbors that can keep you awake in hotel rooms, but also travel anxieties and a list of to-dos ping-ponging around your brain. Robbins suggests writing all of these worries down on a piece of paper as a way to relieve your brain from the burden of them and focus on the task at hand — sleeping. (Related: Trouble sleeping on planes? These science-backed tips will help you snooze while flying.) According to Robbins, good sleep is all about routine. Meditating, taking a long shower, using your favorite night cream, turning off your phone, or popping in your favorite pair of earplugs, your pre-bed rituals from home are key. Repeating those activities while traveling will soothe your body and spirit. “Being religious about these things is actually really important because your brain starts to understand that what comes next is sleep,” says Robbins. Pack your habits with you, even if you think they aren’t the best ones to have. You may feel guilty about your nightly bedtime television sessions, but “screens aren’t necessarily bad,” says Robbins. “If that's part of your relaxing routine, and it's not disrupting your sleep or your ability to fall asleep, I'd say to bring that routine with you when you travel.” She does note that it’s important to have the screens off once it’s helped you hit that sweet spot, as its light has been associated with poor sleep quality. It’s 3 a.m. local time, but your internal clock is still set five hours earlier. As hard as you try, you just can’t fall asleep. Soon you begin to associate your bed with stress and insomnia, and then the temperature of your mattress increases. If you’re struggling, especially in a new time zone, get yourself out of bed, tossing and turning won’t help you. Instead, leaving the scene of the crime will break the cycle. Do something relaxing like a breathing exercise with the lights low, or even folding socks, whatever you find to be sleep inducing. “Then come back to bed when you're tired — that will help you strengthen associations between your bed and a good night's rest,” says Robbins. (Related: Is sleeping on your stomach or back better?) Most importantly, find yourself a hotel that takes its hospitality seriously. While there are many things you can do to ensure a good night’s sleep while traveling, there are an increasing number of hotels that are eager to help you on your journey. Popular hotel amenities now include blackout curtains, pillow menus and sprays, eye masks, bath bombs, and even an evening tea service.

All Rights Reserved. ▶Follow live updates onPresident-elect Donald Trump’s return to Washington  WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th president Monday, returning to power with a promise to end America’s decline and to “completely and totally reverse” the actions of the man who drove him from office four years ago.  Trump overcame impeachments, criminal indictments and a pair of assassination attempts to win another term in the White House, and he planned to act swiftly afterthe ceremony. Dozens ofexecutive orderswere prepared for his signature to clamp down on border crossings, increase fossil fuel development and end diversity and inclusion programs across the federal government.  The orders from the incoming Republican president will begin the process of unraveling the Democratic agenda of Joe Biden, whose term ended at noon, moments before Trump took the oath of office.  Declaring that government faces a “crisis of trust,” Trump said in his inaugural address that under his administration, “our sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced.”  Trump claimed “a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal,” promising to “give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed their freedom.” Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States Monday, overcoming impeachments, criminal indictments and a pair of assassination attempts to take on a second term in the White House.  “From this moment on,” he added as Biden watched from the front row, “America’s decline is over.”  The executive orders are the first step in what Trump calls “the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense.”   Other goals will prove more difficult, perhaps testing the patience of supporters who were promised quick success. Trump has talked about lowering prices after years of inflation, but his plans for tariffs on imports from foreign countries could have the opposite effect.  Frigid weather rewrote the pageantry of the day. Trump’s swearing-inwas moved indoorsto the Capitol Rotunda — the first time that has happenedin 40 years— and the inaugural parade was replaced by an event at a downtown arena. Trump supporters who descended on the city to watch the ceremony outside the Capitol from the National Mall were left to find other places to view the festivities.    At the Capitol, Vice President JD Vance was sworn in first, taking the oath read by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on a Bible given to him by his great-grandmother. Trump followed moments after noon, using both a family Bible and the one used by President Abraham Lincoln at his 1861 inauguration as Chief Justice John Roberts administered his oath.  A cadre of billionaires and tech titans — including Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai — were given prominent positions in the Capitol Rotunda, mingling with Trump’s incoming team before the ceremony began. Also there was Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, who is expectedto lead an effortto slash spending and federal employees.

(AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson, Pool)   Stopping at the White House on their way to the Capitol, Trump and his wife, Melania, were greeted by Biden and first lady Jill Biden for the customary tea and coffee reception. It was a stark departure from four years ago, when Trump refused to acknowledge Biden’s victory or attend his inauguration.  “Welcome home,” Biden said to Trump after the president-elect stepped out of the car. The two presidents, who have spent years bitterly criticizing each other, shared a limo to the Capitol. After the ceremony, Trump walked with Biden to the building’s east side, where Biden departed via helicopter to begin his post-presidential life.  Trump followed Biden’s departure with freewheeling remarks to supporters, revisiting a litany of conspiracy theories about voter fraud and grievances against perceived enemies such as former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, whom he called “a crying lunatic.”  He spoke for even longer than in his inaugural address, saying, “I think this is a better speech than the one I gave upstairs.”  Trump’s inauguration realized a political comeback without precedent in American history. Four years ago, he was voted out of the White House during an economic collapse caused by the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. Trump denied his defeat and tried to cling to power. He directed his supporters tomarch on the Capitolwhile lawmakers were certifying the election results, sparking a riot that interrupted the country’s tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)   But Trump never lost his grip on the Republican Party and was undeterred by criminal cases andtwo assassination attemptsas he steamrolled rivals and harnessed voters’ exasperation with inflation and illegal immigration.  Trump used his inaugural address to repeat his claims that he was targeted by political prosecutions, and he promised to begin “fair, equal and impartial justice.” He also acknowledged that he was taking office on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which honors the slain civil rights hero. “We will strive together to make his dream a reality,” he said.  Now Trump is the first personconvicted of a felony— for falsifying business records related to hush money payments — to serve as president. He pledged to “preserve, protect and defend” the Constitution from the same spot that was overrun by his supporters on Jan. 6, 2021. He’s said that one of his first acts in office will be to pardon many of those who participated in the riot, and he referred to them as “hostages” on Monday.

(AP Photo/Morry Gash, Pool)   “It’s action, not words, that count, and you’re going to see a lot of action,” Trump said.  Eight years after he first entered the White House as a political newcomer, Trump is far more familiar with the operations of federal government and emboldened to bend it to his vision. Trump wants to bring quick change by curtailing immigration, enacting tariffs on imports and rolling back Democrats’ climate and social initiatives.  He has also promised retribution against his political opponents and critics, and placed personal loyalty as a prime qualification for appointments to his administration.  With minutes to go before leaving office, Bidenissued preemptive pardonsto his siblings and their spouses to shield them from the possibility of prosecution. Earlier in the day, he also pardoned current and former government officials who have been the target of Trump’s anger. Biden said “these are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing.”  Trump has pledged to go further and move faster in enacting his agenda than during his first term, and already the country’s political, business and technology leaders have realigned themselves to accommodate him.  Democrats who once formed a “resistance”are now dividedover whether to work with Trump or defy him. Billionaires have lined up to meet with Trump as they acknowledge his unrivaled power in Washington and his ability to wield the levers of government to help or hurt their interests.  Long skeptical of American alliances, Trump’s “America First” foreign policy is being watched warily at home and abroad as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will soon enter its third year, and a fragile ceasefire appears to be holding in Gaza after more than 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas. Trump, who had promised to end the Ukraine war even before he was sworn-in, did not mention the conflict in his inaugural address.  Trump said he would lead a government that “expands our territory,” a reference to his goals of acquiring Greenland from Denmark and restoring U.S. control of the Panama Canal.  He also said he would “pursue our manifest destiny into the stars” by launching American astronauts to Mars. Musk, the owner of a space rocket company with billions of dollars in federal contracts, cheered and pumped his arms above his head as Trump spoke.  Trump plans to crack down on the U.S. southern border with a playbook that’s similar to his first term — declaring a national emergency, limiting the number of refugees entering the U.S. and deploying the military.  He’s also expected to try to end birthright citizenship automatically bestowed on people born in the U.S. and to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government.

        "content": "On Jan. 20, following an embattled first term and tense election year — as well as two impeachments and a felony conviction, a first for any U.S. president — President-elect Donald Trump will be sworn into office for the second time. Observers near and far are gearing up for the ceremony with bated breath, as many stand on guard for the President's remarks following hisincitement to insurrectionon Jan. 6, 2020 — an inflammatory speech that would later win him suspension from several online platforms and an impeachment in the U.S. House. But the President's successful election season may signal a much more calm presidential transition this time around. The inaugural events will be a relatively smaller schedule of activities than previous years, pulling from a $170 million inauguration committee fund (boosted by some of the incoming leader's biggest tech allies, includingMeta's Mark Zuckerberg). Inauguration ball performers will include acountry lineupof Carrie Underwood, Rascal Flatts, Kid Rock, Billy Ray Cyrus, and Lee Greenwood. The Village People will be performing at events throughout the weekend, and opera singer Christopher Macchio will perform the national anthem during the ceremony. Confirmed guests include President Joe Biden, President Barack Obama, President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush, as well as President Bill Clinton and former presidential runner Hillary Clinton. Trump has also invited several international political leaders, which could see an unprecedented turnout of world leaders in the Inauguration ceremony's history. Argentinian President Javier Milei has confirmed his attendance, while Chinese President Xi Jinping will be sending an official envoy,Forbesreports. Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has said he is attempting to gain entry into the country to attend the events, as well. AndTrump's tech circlewill be front row, including Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and, reportedly, OpenAI's Sam Altman andTikTok CEO Shou Chew. Inaugural events will begin on Saturday, Jan. 18, with the actual swearing-in ceremony taking place at 12 p.m. EST on Monday, Jan. 20. The ceremony will be broadcasted live on all major networks (ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, NBC and PBS), as well as CSPAN. For online streaming, viewers can tune into official YouTube livestreams, includingABC,CBS,PBS News Hour,USA TODAY, andFox News. NBC viewers can catch coverage onNBC News Now,and CNBC will be airing their coverage live on theCNBChomepage. Viewers can also stream the Inauguration via the live news hubs on their favorite streaming platforms, like ABC for Disney+ and CNN for Max, or directly on theWhite House website. Many tuning in to Monday's ceremony will be wondering when Trump will be able to execute his executive powers. Starting from the time of election to inauguration day (about 75 days), the incoming Trump administration will have been beefing up a roster of transition staff and volunteers to aid in a smoother transfer of power, explains theCenter for Presidential Transition, a nonpartisan nonprofit. During this time, the President-elect will have also announced his picks for prized appointments. A post-inauguration \"handover\" phase then begins, while the new administration enters a 200-day blitz period with the goal of enshrining as many early policy wins as possible. On day one of his presidency, Trump will have the ability to sign executive orders and reverse existing policies, which he has alreadypledged to do. Experts anticipate the new President tackling tariffs, immigration, and environmental policy almost immediately — some of these priorities, including tariffs and any federal employee rollbacks, will have immediate effects, while others will act more symbolically. Trump will also immediately gain executive clemency powers, allowing him to pardon and commute the sentences of individuals. Americans can also expect more appointment and staffing announcements in the post-inauguration period.

        "content": "Donald Trump is officially the 47th President as ofInauguration Day. In a 30-minute speech, Trump proclaimed that \"the golden age of America begins right now,\" and promised many changes. Here are a few of them below, along with how viewers on social media reacted to it: Trump ran on an anti-immigration stance, discussingending birthright citizenshipand planningsweeping deportationsduring his campaign. On Monday, Trump mentioned that he woulddeclare a national emergencyat the southern border of the U.S., halting immigration. Trump used the term \"criminal aliens,\" which was stated several times inProject 2025(the conservative policy wishlist for Trump's second term). Following the speech, theTrump administration shut down CBP One, an app for migrants to legally enter the U.S. The effects were instant: The \"Green New Deal\" isn't the law of the land,despite effortsby progressive politiciansin recent years. On Inauguration Day, however, Trump promised to \"terminate\" spending on the Green New Deal. Axious speculated that he meantBiden's Inflation Reduction Act, which did address climate change. Still, social media was quick to note that Biden didn't run nor try to enact the Green New Deal: Sen. Ed Markey, who did run on the Green New Deal, came to X to express his feelings: It's no secret thatTrump's policies are a threat to trans people, and since his first term trans people saidTrump is \"not a friend.\"On Monday, Trump said he would instate an official policy that there are \"only\" two genders, male and female. Trans journalist Erin Reed posted on Bluesky that, \"It's going to be quite a slog for 4 years\": Whelp. JD Vance, author of one of the most repressive trans bans ever proposed in congress, is now our VP.\n\nIt's going to be quite a slog for 4 years. Multiple people pointed out that Trump stated this soon after declaring that \"free expression will no longer be limited\": Trump said he'll sign an executive order to stop \"government censorship\" and \"bring back free speech in America.\" While it's not immediately clear what Trump means by this, page 687 ofProject 2025recommends Trump \"[s]upport free speech and hold big tech accountable. Immediately conduct a thorough review of federal policy regarding free speech online and provide policy solutions to address big tech’s censorship of speech.\" That was a pretty quick segue from \"we're bringing back free speech and ending government censorship\" to \"here are the things government employees will be no longer allowed to say about sex, gender, and race.\" Don’t get it twisted when trump says he wants to “bring back free speech” he means HIS type of free speech. Which is full of bullshit and misinformation Project 2025 also calls for the removal of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, which Trump also mentioned during Monday's speech: Trump called for an \"end [to] the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life,\" an usher in a society that is \"colorblind\" and \"merit-based.\" People online retorted, saying such actions don't decrease inflation. The notion torename the region to the Gulf of Americaisn't new, butTrump has run with itin recent months. He mentioned it in his inaugural speech on Monday. As Trump's first 100 days unfold, we'll see which of these policies he tries to enact. TopicsDonald TrumpPolitics Anna Iovine is associate editor of features at Mashable.

At noon today, Donald Trump took the presidential oath for a second time, capping a historic political comeback to the White House. As he did on the campaign trail, Trump painted a dark picture of America and took aim at President Joe Biden's leadership as his predecessor sat just steps away. \"My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal, and all of these many betrayals that have taken place, and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and indeed their freedom,\" Trump said, promising a \"golden age of America.\" The flag at the White House has been raised after Trump signed a proclamation for flags to be flown at full staff on all inauguration days.   The flag had been at half-staff following President Jimmy Carter’s death on Dec. 29. Trump is ordering the flag to return to half-staff on Tuesday for the remainder of the 30-day period, which began the day of 100-year-old Carter’s death. Last week, House Speaker Mike Johnson ordered that the flags at the Capitol be raised for the inauguration. -ABC News’ Justin Ryan Gomez With a flurry of executive orders expected today, President Donald Trump's top advisers, including his incoming Department of Justice leadership, are preparing for a storm of legal challenges to some of the most controversial ones. \"We're going to get sued on all of these things,\" one top Trump adviser said, adding that the volume of litigation is expected to be a full-time job for Trump's DOJ.   Trump has privately told advisers that he believes flooding the zone with executive orders will lead to lawsuits that may be less effective given the volume of actions he plans to take. During Trump's first administration, he faced upwards of 400 lawsuits challenging his actions. His advisers anticipate more than that this time. There will be a team inside the Justice Department that is dedicated just to defending Trump's actions in court, sources said. -ABC News’ Katherine Faulders Thetransition from the Biden White House to the Trump White Houseis well underway and crews are working quickly to make the changes before Trump arrives later this afternoon, but the choices are nearly identical to his first term.   In the Oval Office, gold curtains have returned behind the Resolute Desk, as well as the red-and-beige carpet with green leaves that covered the wood floor. As Trump sits at his desk, the portrait of President Andrew Jackson returned to the wall on his left side, just as it was during his first term. Biden had a portrait of Benjamin Franklin. To Trump’s right, where Biden hung a 1917 flag-decorated Childe Hassam painting, President Abraham Lincoln is now back on display. Other areas of the West Wing still need to be unboxed.

        "source": "https://nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "The legendary civil rights activist pushed to ban nuclear weapons, end the Vietnam War, and lift people out of poverty through labor unions and access to healthcare. The Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. towers over history as a civil rights legend—known for leadingthe movement to end segregation and counter prejudiceagainst Black Americans in the 1950s and 1960s, largely through peaceful protests. He helped pass landmark federal civil rights and voting rights legislation that outlawed segregation and enfranchised Americans who had been barred from the polls through intimidation and discriminatory state and local laws. (How the Voting Rights Act was won—and why it’s under fire today.) But King knew it would take more to achieve true equality. And so he also worked tirelessly for education, wage equity, peace, housing, and to lift people out of poverty. Some of King’s most iconic speeches and marches were devoted to ending war, dismantling nuclear weapons, and bringing economic justice. As King said after receiving theNobel Peace Prize in 1964, he believed that any “spiritual and moral lag” in humanity was due to racial injustice, poverty, and war. His multifaceted view on human rights still inspires today, and on the third Monday in January every year, the United States honors King’s legacy of fighting for equal rights—and standing up for human rights everywhere. During his lifetime, King’s views often made him unpopular and heralded harsh criticism. At the time of his assassination in 1968,a Harris poll revealed a low approval ratingof only about 25 percent among white Americans and 52 percent among Black Americans. But in the decades after he was killed, more Americans came to recognize the enormity of King’s contributions. Communities across the country began to name streets and landmarks after him, and soon a push began to establish a federal holiday in his birth month of January. (Subscriber exclusive: Where the streets have MLK’s name.) In 1983, over objections from Southern lawmakers, President Ronald Reagan finally signed a bill creating the holiday into law and the first celebrations of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day took place in January 1986—although it would take another decade for states such as Arizona and South Carolina to follow suit. King’s work continues to influence and inspire activism—particularly in the realm of environmental justice, as studies indicate that climate change disproportionately harms marginalized communities. Here are the many layers of King’s work that the U.S. honors on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. King was adamant that peace was inextricably linked to civil rights. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, major powers like the United States and the U.S.S.R. were aggressively developing and testing nuclear weapons, and several times crept to the brink of warfare that threatened to annihilate the world. King made clear the connection between the Black freedom struggle and the need for nuclear disarmament, writes nuclear studies and African American history expert Vincent Intondi in the bookAfrican Americans Against the Bomb: Nuclear Weapons, Colonialism, and the Black Freedom Movement. King argued that it would be “rather absurd” to integrate schools and lunch counters but not be concerned with world peace and survival. King spoke out about nuclear warfare as early as 1957, when he signed onto a full-page advertisement inThe New York Timesthat called for all nations to suspend nuclear tests immediately. When asked about his stance later that same year, King tied the weapons to the whole of war, and argued that they should be banned everywhere. “It cannot be disputed that a full-scale nuclear war would be utterly catastrophic,” he toldEbonymagazine in an interview. “The principal objective of all nations must be the total abolition of war.” As part of King’s advocacy for peace and nuclear disarmament, he condemned the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki the U.S. government had carried out more than a decade earlier to effectively end World War II. Today, Hiroshima isone of the only cities outside North Americato celebrate Martin Luther King Day. King also used the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962—a 13-day stretch in which the U.S. and Soviet Unionstood on the brink of nuclear warover the discovery of Soviet missiles in Cuba—as an opportunity to connect nuclear disarmament to racial and economic justice. King called for the U.S. government to instead turn its attention and funds to education, Medicare, and civil rights, Intondi writes. He then voiced his support for anuclear test ban treaty, which was signed by President John F. Kennedy in 1963. King often linked nuclear disarmament with the Vietnam War as it escalated in the 1960s. King was against the war but initially worried that making his stance public would derail his work to pass the Civil Rights Act and impair his relationship with President Lyndon B. Johnson, according tothe Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford University. But in 1965, the year the first U.S. ground troops were sent to Vietnam, King issued his first public statement, asserting the war was “accomplishing nothing” and calling for a peace treaty. He tempered his criticism for the next two years to avoid diminishing the impact of his civil rights work, but by 1967, King was active in the anti-war sphere again,attending a march in Chicagobefore he went on to make his most notable speech on the matter a few days later on April 4. It is no longer a choice, my friends, between violence and nonviolence. It is either nonviolence or nonexistence. And the alternative to disarmament… may well be a civilizationplunged into the abyss of annihilation, and our earthly habitat would be transformed into an inferno that even the mind of Dante could not imagine. On that day at the Riverside Church in New York City, Kingdenounced the warfor deepening the problems of Black Americans and people living in poverty. He condemned the “madness” of Vietnam as a “symptom of a far deeper malady” that put the U.S. at odds with the aspirations for social justice throughout the world. Just 11 days later, King led 125,000 demonstrators on ananti-war march to the United Nationsheadquarters in New York as one of the largest peace demonstrations in history. During thelast year of his life, King continued his anti-war work by encouraging grassroots peace activism. On March 31, 1968, five days before he died, King denounced the Vietnam War in his final Sunday sermon at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.,sayingthat it was “one of the most unjust wars that has ever been fought in the history of the world.” King did not live to see the war end. U.S. troops officiallypulled out of Vietnam in April 1975. King's passion for union representation and workers' rights is also an important part of his legacy. Much as he had done with his anti-war speeches, King often tied workers’ rights to the civil rights movement. “I had also learned that the inseparable twin of racial injustice was economic injustice,” King said in a1958 speech in New York. “Although I came from a home of economic security and relative comfort, I could never get out of my mind the economic insecurity of many of my playmates and the tragic poverty of those living around me.” In a1959 interview withChallengemagazine, King acknowledged that labor unions had historically left out Black Americans, but also could be a key to economic justice. He called for Black Americans to organize their economic and political power in the form of labor unions, and he championed ideas in the labor movement, including better working conditions, adequate housing, guaranteed annual income, and access to healthcare. For years, King continued to call for economic justice, notably at the August 28, 1963, March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Before a crowd of 250,000 people, he delivered the legendary“I Have A Dream” speechon the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, where he called for an end to poverty, especially targeted poverty and discrimination against Black Americans. One of King’s last actions before his assassination was in support of the labor movement. King’s final days were spentsupporting a group of Black sanitation workers strikingin Memphis, Tennessee. After two workers had been crushed to death by a malfunctioning truck, 1,300 Black workers went on strike for 11 days, seeking an end to a long pattern of neglect and abuse from their management. The strike would’ve ended after the City Council voted to recognize their newly formed union, but the Memphis mayor rejected the vote. King traveled to Memphis tolead a protest marchand, on April 3, he spoke to the striking sanitation workers. “We’ve got to give ourselves to this struggle until the end,”King said. “Nothing would be more tragic than to stop at this point in Memphis. We’ve got to see it through.” King was gunned down by an assassin on the balcony of his Memphis hotel the next day. On April 16, the sanitation workers’ union was finally recognized and a better wage was promised—the first of many examples of how King’s legacy would continue to reverberate in the work of those whom he inspired. I have theaudacity to believethat peoples everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds, and dignity, equality and freedom for their spirits. Although King’s last act supporting the Black sanitation workers in Memphis was not explicitly an act ofenvironmental justice, it has inspired a generation of activists. The working conditions the sanitation workers had endured were polluted and hazardous—much like the conditions many Black Americans endured in their communities and jobs at the time. Modern environmental activists havedrawn on King’s message:Much as segregation and discrimination were inseparable from poverty, they point out that poor communities of color disproportionately face environmental hazards such as pollution. They also bear the brunt of the harmful effects of climate change, including extreme weather events. (The origins of environmental justice—and why it’s finally getting the attention it deserves.) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, whichprohibits discrimination in the use of federal funds, even gave marginalized peoplea means to address racial discriminationin environmental matters.As the environmental justice movement grew, King’s work alsoinspiredthe Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act. His advocacy for people of color to have a voice and power has inspired many communities impacted most by climate change to speak up—and take action. Now, the holiday honoring King is typically observed as a national day of service. Organizations and individuals alike volunteer for their communities, often cleaning up roads or river banks in the name of a man who many believewould be on the forefront of the climate fightif he were still alive today.

        "content": "Two big, somewhat conflicting studies on alcohol risks will influence new guidelines. Heavy drinking is clearly bad for your health. But it's long been questioned whether moderate drinking is also risky—and, if so, how risky, exactly. Health researchers have consistently found links between alcohol consumption and several types of cancers (namely mouth, throat, colon, rectal, liver, and breast), as well as liver diseases, injuries, and traffic accidents. But nailing down the health risks from the lower levels of drinking has been tricky. For one, much of the data on moderate drinking is from observational studies in different countries, cultures, and populations. They cannot determine if alcohol is the direct cause of any given association, and they may be swayed by other lifestyle factors. The resulting data can be noisy and inconsistent. Moreover, many studies rely on people to self-report whether they drink and, if so, how much, which is problematic because people may not accurately assess and/or report how much they actually drink. A related problem is that studies in the past often compared drinkers to people who said they didn't drink. But, the trouble is, non-drinking groups are often some mix of people who are lifelong abstainers and people who used to drink but quit for some reason—maybe because of health effects. This latter group has the potential to have lingering health effects from their drinking days, which could skew any comparisons looking for health differences. Then there's the larger, common problem with any research focused on food or beverages: some have been sponsored or somehow swayed by industry, casting suspicion on the findings, particularly the ones indicating benefits. This has been a clear problem for alcohol research. For instance, in 2018, the National Institutes of Healthshut down a $100 million trialaimed at assessing the health effects (and potential benefits) of moderate drinking after it came to light that much of the funding was solicited from the alcohol industry. There was a lot of questionable communication between NIH scientists and alcohol industry representatives. With all of that in the background, there's been clamorous debate about how much risk, if any, people are swallowing with their evening cocktail, gameday beer, or wine with dinner. Currently, the US dietary guidance recommends that if adults drink, they should stick to drinking in moderation, defined as \"alcohol intake to two drinks or fewer in a day for men and one drink or fewer in a day for women.\" But recently, health experts in the US and abroad have started calling for lower limits, noting that more data has poured in that fortifies links to cancers and other risks. In 2023, for instance, Canada released recommendations that people limit their alcohol consumption totwo drinks or fewer per week—that's down significantly from the previously recommended limit of10 drinks per week for women and 15 drinks per week for men. Now, it's America's turn to decide if they'll set the bar lower, too. This year, the US will update its dietary guidelines, which are carried out by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture every five years. The federal government has requested two big scientific reviews to assess the current knowledge of the health effects of alcohol, which will both inform any potential revisions to the alcohol guidelines. Now, both studies have been released and are open for discussion. One is from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (the National Academies), which was tasked by Congress to review the current evidence on alcohol with a focus on how moderate drinking potentially affects a specific set of health outcomes. The review compared health outcomes in moderate drinkers with those of lifelong abstainers. For the review, the National Academies set up a committee of 14 experts. The other report is fromthe Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Prevention of Underage Drinking (ICCPUD), which set up a Technical Review Subcommittee on Alcohol Intake and Health. Forits report, the subcommittee looked not just at moderate drinking but health outcomes of a range of alcohol consumption compared to lifelong abstainers. Based on top-line takeaways and tone, the two reports seem to have very different findings. While the National Academies review found a mix of benefits and harms from moderate drinking (one drink per day for women, and two per day for men), the ICCPUD review suggested that even the smallest amounts of alcohol (one drink per week) increased risk of death and various diseases. However, a closer look at the data shows they have some common ground. First, for the National Academies' review, experts found sufficient evidence to assess the effects of moderate drinking on all-cause mortality, certain cancers, and cardiovascular risks. On the other hand, the reviewers found insufficient evidence to assess moderate drinking's impact on weight changes, neurocognition, and lactation-related risks. For all-cause mortality, a meta-analysis of data from eight studies found that moderate drinkers had a 16 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality (death from any cause) compared with lifelong abstainers. A meta-analysis of three studies suggested the risk of all-cause mortality was 23 percent lower for females who drank moderately compared to never-drinking females. Data from four studies indicated that moderate drinking males had a 16 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality than never-drinking males. Additional analyses found that the risk of all-cause mortality was 20 percent lower for moderate drinkers less than age 60 and 18 percent lower for moderate drinkers age 60 and up. \"Based on data from the eight eligible studies from 2019 to 2023, the committee concludes that compared with never consuming alcohol, moderate alcohol consumption is associated with lower all-cause mortality,\" the review states. The reviewers rated the conclusion as having \"moderate certainty.\" For a look at cancer risks, a meta-analysis of four studies on breast cancer found that moderate drinkers had an overall 10 percent higher risk than non-drinkers. An additional analysis of seven studies found that for every 10 to 14 grams of alcohol (0.7 to one standard drink) consumed per day, there was a 5 percent higher risk of breast cancer. The data indicated that people who drank higher amounts of alcohol within the moderate range had higher risks than those who drank lower amounts in the moderate range (for instance, one drink a day versus 0.5 drinks a day). For context, the average lifetime risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer in non-drinking females is about 11 to 12 percent. A 10 percent relative increase in risk would raise a person's absolute risk to around 12 to 13 percent. The average lifetime risk of any female dying of breast cancer is 2.5 percent. Overall, the reviewers concluded that \"consuming a moderate amount of alcohol was associated with a higher risk of breast cancer,\" and the conclusion was rated as having moderate certainty. A meta-analysis on colorectal cancer risks found a \"statistically nonsignificant higher risk\" in moderate drinkers compared to non-drinkers. However, studies looking at alcohol consumption at the highest levels of moderate drinking for males (e.g., two drinks per day) suggested a higher risk compared to males who drank lower amounts of alcohol in the moderate range (one drink per day). The review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support a link between moderate drinking and oral cavity, pharyngeal, esophageal, and laryngeal cancers. Finally, for cardiovascular risks, meta-analyses found moderate drinking was associated with a 22 percent lower risk of heart attacks and an 11 percent lower risk of stroke (driven by lower risk of ischemic stroke, specifically). The reviewers rated these associations as low certainty, though, after noting that there was some concern for risk of bias in the studies. For cardiovascular disease mortality, meta-analyses of four studies found an 18 percent lower risk of death among moderate drinkers compared with non-drinkers. Broken down, there was a 23 percent lower risk in female drinkers and 18 percent lower risk in male drinkers. The lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality was rated as moderate certainty. The ICCPUD subcommittee's report offered a darker outlook on moderate drinking, concluding that \"alcohol use is associated with increased mortality for seven types of cancer (colorectal, female breast, liver, oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus [squamous cell type]),\" and \"increased risk for these cancers begins with any alcohol use and increases with higher levels of use.\" The review modeled lifetime risks of cancer and death and relative risks for a long list of problems, including infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, and injuries. Also, it didn't just focus on non-drinkers versus moderate drinkers, but it assessed the relative risk of six levels of drinking: one drink a week; two drinks a week; three drinks a week; seven drinks a week (one a day); 14 drinks a week (two a day), and 21 drinks a week (three a day). Overall, the analysis is very much a rough draft. There are some places where information is missing, and some of the figures are mislabeled and difficult to read. There are two figures labeled Figure 6, for instance and Figure 7 (which may be Figure 8), is a graph that doesn't have a Y-axis, making it difficult to interpret. The study also doesn't discuss the level of potential bias of individual studies in its analyses. It also doesn't make note of statistically insignificant results, nor comment on the certainty of any of its findings. For instance, the top-line summary states: \"In the United States, males and females have a 1 in 1,000 risk of dying from alcohol use if they consume more than 7 drinks per week. This risk increases to 1 in 100 if they consume more than 9 drinks per week.\" But a look at the modeling behind these estimates indicates the cutoffs of when drinkers would reach a 0.1 percent or 1 percent risk of dying from alcohol use are broad. For males, a 0.1 percent lifetime risk of an alcohol-attributed death is reached at 6.5 standard drinks, with a 95 percent confidence interval spanning less than one drink per week and 13.5 drinks per week. \"This lifetime risk rose to 1 in 100 people above 8.5 drinks per week,\" the text reads, but the confidence interval is again between one and 14 drinks per week. So, basically, at anywhere between about one and 14 drinks a week, a male's lifetime risk of dying from alcohol may be either 0.1 or 1 percent, according to this modeling. Regarding risk of death, the study did not look at all-cause mortality, like the National Academies review. Instead, it focused on deaths from causes specifically linked to alcohol. For both males and females, modeling indicated that the total lifetime risk of any alcohol-attributed death for people who consumed one, two, three, or seven drinks per week was statistically non-significant (the confidence intervals for each calculation spanned zero). Among those who have 14 drinks per week, the total lifetime risk of death was about 4 in 100 from all causes, with unintentional injuries being the biggest contributor for males and liver diseases being the biggest contributor for females. Among those who have 21 drinks per week, the risk of death was about 7 in 100 for males and 8 in 100 for females. Unintentional injuries and liver diseases were again the biggest contributors to the risk. Some experts have speculated that the lower risk of all-cause mortality found in the National Academies' analysis (which has been seen in previous studies) may be due to healthy lifestyle patterns among people who drink moderately rather than the protective effects of alcohol. The line of thinking would suggest that healthy lifestyle choices, like regular exercise and a healthy diet, can negate certain risks, including the potential risks of alcohol. However, the ICCPUD emphasizes the reverse argument, noting that poor health choices would likely exacerbate the risks of alcohol. \"[A]lcohol would have a greater impact on the health of people who smoke, have poor diets, engage in low physical activity, are obese, have hepatitis infection, or have a family history of specific diseases than it would other individuals.\" In terms of relative risk of the range of conditions, generally, the ICCPUD study found small, if any, increases in risk at the three lowest levels of drinking, with risks rising with higher levels. The study's finding of breast cancer risk was in line with the National Academies' review. ICCPUD found that pre-menopausal females who drink moderately (one drink per day) had a 6 percent higher risk of breast cancer than non-drinkers, while post-menopausal moderate drinkers had a 17 percent higher risk. (You can seethe complete set of relative risk estimates in Table A6beginning on page 70 of the report.) For some cancers, moderate drinking raised the risk substantially. For instance, males who have two drinks per day see their risk of esophageal cancer more than double. But, it's important to note that the absolute risk for many of these cancers is small to begin with. The average risk of esophageal cancer in men is 0.8 percent,according to the American Cancer Society. With the increased risk from moderate drinking, it would be below 2 percent. Still, alcohol consumption increased the risks of nearly all the cancers examined, with the higher levels of alcohol consumption having the highest risk. As for cardiovascular risks, ICCPUD's review found low risk in several of the categories. The risk of ischemic heart disease was lower than that of nondrinkers at all six drinking levels. The risk of ischemic stroke was lower among drinkers who had one, two, three, or seven drinks per week compared to non-drinkers. At 14 and 21 drinks per week, the risk of ischemic stroke rose by 8 percent. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — After 15 months of collective grief and anxiety,three Israeli hostagesleft Hamas captivity and returned to Israel, and dozens of Palestinian prisoners walked free from Israeli jail, leaving both Israelis and Palestinians torn between celebration and trepidation asthe ceasefire between Israel and Hamastook hold Sunday.  The skies above Gaza and Israel were silent for the first time in over a year, and Palestinians began returning to what was left of the homes they fled across the war-ravaged enclave, started to check on relatives left behind and, in many cases, to bury their dead. After months of tight Israeli restrictions, more than 600 trucks carrying humanitarian aid rolled into the devastated territory.  The ceasefire that went into effect Sunday morning stirred modest hopes for ending the Israel-Hamas war.  But in Israel, the joy of seeing freed hostages Emily Damari, Romi Gonen, and Doron Steinbrecher reunited with their families was tempered by major questions over the fate of the nearly 100 others abducted in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack, still in captivity in Gaza. The three are expected to stay in the hospital for a number of days. All of the released hostages were able to walk under their own power, despite concerns about their conditions.  Damari, Gonen and Steinbrecher were the first among 33 Israeli hostages who are meant to be released in the coming six weeks in a deal that includes a pause in fighting, the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and increased fuel and aid deliveries for Gaza.

(AP Photo/Maya Alleruzzo)      What happens after the deal’s first phase of 42 days is uncertain. The agreement’s subsequent stages call for more releases of hostages and prisoners and a permanent end to the war.  But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was pressured by the outgoing Biden administration and incoming Trump administration to secure a deal before the president-elect’s inauguration Monday in Washington, has said he received assurances from Trump that Israel could continue fighting Hamas if necessary.  On Sunday, many Israelis stayed glued to TV screens all afternoon to glimpse the women being released through the windows of the Red Cross ambulance. Footage showed them thronged by thousands of jostling Palestinians, including Hamas gunmen wearing green headbands, as militants handed them over to the Red Cross on a packed street in Gaza City.  “An entire nation embraces you,” Netanyahu said.  National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right lawmaker who resigned on Sunday from Netanyahu’s governing coalition over the ceasefire, said the nation was “happy and excited” for their release.  In videos released by the Israeli government, the women were seen weeping and hugging their family members. Damari raised her bandaged hand in triumph.  The military said she lost two fingers in the Hamas-led militant attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed over 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and resulted in the abduction of some 250 others.  Applause erupted among the thousands who gathered to watch the poignant scenes on large screens at Hostages Square, the Tel Aviv plaza where families and supporters of hostages have been protesting weekly to demand a ceasefire deal.  It took another seven hours for such scenes to unfold in the occupied West Bank, where the mood was initially subdued as the Israeli military warned that public celebrations for the released prisoners would be punished.

(AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi)   But scuffles with Israeli security forces and hours of waiting did little to deter the crowds that flooded the streets around 1 a.m., as large white buses carrying 90 Palestinian detainees — all women or teens — exited the gates of Ofer prison, near the West Bank city of Ramallah.  Drivers revved their engines in celebration. Fireworks erupted. Several men climbed on top of the bus and hoisted three Hamas flags. “God is greater!” the crowds shouted.   AP correspondent Julie Walker reports on the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip which took effect on Sunday.  Many of those released expressed elation tinged with grief for the devastation wrought by the war in Gaza.  A “double feeling” is how the most prominent detainee freed, Khalida Jarrar, 62, described it. Jarrar is a leading member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a secular leftist faction that was involved in attacks against Israel in the 1970s but later scaled back militant activities. Since her arrest in late 2023, she was held under indefinitely renewable administrative detention — a widely criticized practice that Israel uses against Palestinians.  “There’s this double feeling we’re living in, on the one hand, this feeling of freedom, that we thank everyone for, and on the other hand, this pain, of losing so many Palestinian martyrs,” she told The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana)   All of those being released had been detained for what Israel called offenses related to its security, from throwing stones and promoting violence on social media to more serious accusations such as attempted murder.   Aerial footage on Sunday showed the devastation caused to the city of Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip following 15 months of fighting between Israel and Hamas. Israeli bombardment and ground operations have transformed entire neighbourhoods in several cities in the enclave into rubble-strewn wastelands, with blackened shells of buildings and mounds of debris stretching away in all directions.  The next release of hostages and prisoners is due Saturday. In just over two weeks, talks are to begin on the far more challenging second phase of the ceasefire agreement.    In Gaza, there was palpable relief at the prospect of six weeks without fighting and Israeli bombardment that so far has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which says women and children make up more than half the fatalities but does not distinguish between civilians and fighters.  The skies above the besieged territory were free of Israeli warplanes for the first day since a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023 that freed over 100 hostages, offering Palestinians a chance to take stock of the devastation.  “This ceasefire was a joy mixed with pain,” said Rami Nofal, a displaced man from Gaza City, explaining that his son was killed in an Israeli airstrike.  Triumphant Hamas militants appeared at some celebrations, as crowds chanted slogans in support of them. The Hamas-run police reemerged from months of hiding.  Some families set off for home on foot, their belongings loaded on donkey carts.  In the southern city of Rafah,residents returned to find massive destructionthat they described as a dystopia. Some found human remains in the rubble.  “It’s like what you see in a Hollywood horror movie,” Mohamed Abu Taha said as he inspected the ruins of his family’s home.    In Israel, the scenes of Hamas gunmen celebrating openly in the streets of Gaza underscored divisions over the ceasefire deal.  Asher Pizem, 35, from the city of Sderot, said the deal had merely postponed Israel’s next confrontation with Hamas. He also criticized Israel for allowing aid into Gaza, saying it would contribute to the militant group’s revival.  “They will take the time and attack again,” he said, looking out over Gaza’s smoldering ruins from a small hill in southern Israel with other Israelis gathered to watch as the agreement went into effect. Warplanes roared, helicopters thudded and drones buzzed in the final moments before the ceasefire.    The toll of the war has been staggering, and new details about its scale and impact will emerge.  Israeli forces were pulling back from some areas of Gaza, in line with the ceasefire agreement, residents of northern Gaza reported.  Some 90% of Gaza’s population has been displaced. Rebuilding — if the ceasefire leads to the war’s end —will take several years at least.  There should be a surge of humanitarian aid, with hundreds of trucks entering Gaza daily,far more than Israel allowed before.  “This is a moment of tremendous hope,” U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said. “Fragile, yet vital.”   Magdy reported from Cairo, Shurafa from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, Lidman from Narariya, Israel.

        "title": "DC-area veterinarians on heightened alert amid potential inauguration risks",
        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "There is no specific threat, but the alert highlights One Health approach to risk. Veterinarians in the Washington, DC region have been put on alert for any unusual illnesses in their non-human patients amid today's presidential inauguration—a nod to the significance of potential zoonotic bioterror threats. In a recent letter to Virginia veterinarians, the state health department requested assistance in the \"enhanced surveillance,\" while noting that, currently, there is no report of threats or bioterrorism-related illnesses. \"As with any large-scale public event, there will be heightened security, and the region will be on alert or signs of bioterrorism or other potential threats,\" the letter read. \"Enhanced surveillance is being conducted out of an abundance of caution.\" Health officials are asking veterinarians to report any animals who develop an unusual, severe illness within 14 days of exposure to the National Mall area during the inaugural period between January 19 and January 21. The cases could include animals who travel to the area or who live there. If such a case arises, veterinarians should report the case \"rapidly by phone\" to the officials in the state's Zoonotic Disease Program. That includes State Public Health Veterinarian Julia Murphy. In an interview with Ars Technica, Murphy noted that the health department has requested enhanced surveillance from veterinarians in the past. \"We did a similar thing for the last inauguration,\" she said. The recruitment of veterinarians highlights the threat posed by zoonotic diseases—that is, those that can transmit between animals and humans. And it demonstrates the value of a \"One Health\" approach to health, which recognizes the interconnection between animals, humans, and shared environments. In emerging outbreaks or bioterror events, animal illnesses have the potential to act as sentinels—the first to show signs of a disease—as well as be informative for understanding the geographic scope and severity of an event, Murphy explained. For instance, the bacteriumFrancisella tularensis, which causes a potentially serious illness calledtularemia, is particularly dangerous for rabbits and rodents. \"Their incubation period can be quite short—typically, not always—but it can often be shorter than in people,\" she said, referring to the time between an exposure to an illness and when symptoms develop.F. tularensisis considered a potential bioterror weapon and appears on the federal list ofSelect Agents and Toxins. Murphy also noted the role of birds in detectingthe introduction of West Nile Virus to North America in 1999. In August of that year, the New York City Department of Health identified eight people with severe encephalitis (brain inflammation) within a 16-square mile area around Queens. It was not immediately clear what was behind the disease cluster, but a deadly outbreak among area birds at the same time led disease detectives to the answer. West Nile Virus was first isolated from tissue samples from American crows in neighboring Westchester County, N.Y., and a Chilean flamingo in a nearby zoo. Subsequent testing linked the virus to the human cases. In regard to a potential biological or toxic threat at the inauguration, health officials left the possibilities wide open. The letter notes some recognizable threats, such as anthrax, tularemia, Ebola, plague, and botulism. A noninclusive list of concerning symptoms included fever, vesicles, hemorrhage, severe head and neck swelling, paralysis and other neurologic signs, sepsis, multi-organ failure, and death. But Murphy emphasized that these were just some examples. What veterinarians should really look for is a combination of something unusual, exposure to the inauguration area, and being in the two-week window. \"If they're seeing anything that that strikes them as unusual—maybe unusually severe illness or clusters of illness—and they have any concern at all that that animal may have had some type of connection to the general area around which the inauguration is happening, they should alert us and we can talk it through,\" Murphy said. Next steps would include connecting with diagnostic resources, and potentially reaching out to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Agriculture. Murphy also noted that the public health system has built up strong relationships with the clinical veterinarian community. \"If something was to happen, I have a high degree of confidence that we would hear about it early and quickly.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

        "title": "These inaugurations shaped our presidential ceremonies today",
        "source": "https://nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "Typically celebrated with parades and balls, Inauguration Day is not just pomp: After bitter U.S. elections—and even during the Civil War—the ceremony has been a visual reminder of the peaceful transfer of power. The U.S. presidential inauguration is the ultimate symbol of the peaceful transfer of power in America. Even after contested elections—and when the union among the states was in peril—presidents have stood before the public andsworn an oathto “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.” Inauguration Day’s many traditions help reinforce that symbolic role. Typically, the daybeginswith the president-elect traveling with the outgoing president and congressional leaders to Capitol Hill to take the oath of office and deliver an inaugural address before throngs of people. The new president then leads a parade back to the White House, and caps off the day by attending multiple inaugural balls held throughout the nation’s capital. These traditions are more than just pomp, saysMatthew Costello, senior historian at the White House Historical Association. “To be this politically stable with one form of government is unusual. So when we talk about what makes America unique or exceptional, these are the moments where we get to see it in action—we get to see one president handing power off to the next.” This doesn't always happen. In 2021, President Donald Trump became the fourth president in U.S. history to skip his successor’s inauguration. But this year former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clintonareexpected to attendTrump's inauguration after his reelection. (How totalk to kids about the election.) But the symbolism of this year’s ceremony will be as critical as any in years past. Here’s a look at how inaugural traditions have evolved, and how they reinforce the peaceful transfer of power that’s one of the foundations of America’s constitutional democracy. The U.S. Constitution stipulates that a president must take the oath of office before the start of a term. Even presidents who are reelected swear the oath of office again at the beginning of each four-year term—a tradition that started with the country’s first president, George Washington, whose inauguration also set the standard for some of the day’s important rituals. On April 30, 1789, Washingtonwas escortedby a military contingent to New York City’s Federal Hall, then home to the U.S. Congress. He was sworn in on a balcony as hundreds of people looked on from the streets below, then delivered his inaugural address from the Senate chamber. After a church service and a quiet dinner at home, Washington took in a firework display that lit up the New York skies. (President George Washington: Calm, Cool, and Collected Commander in Chief.) For nearly 150 years after Washington’s first inauguration, the ceremony was held in early March. In 1933, the ratification of the20th Amendmentmoved the date to noon on January 20 to shorten the transition period thathad proven fraughtduring pivotal times such as the Civil War and the Great Depression. Although Washington had startled the world by stepping down after two terms—relinquishing the presidency to Vice President John Adams in 1797—America’s first real test of the peaceful transfer of power occurred with the 1801 inauguration of Thomas Jefferson, the nation’s third president. Tensions between Adams and Jefferson were running high following a bitter election. They further escalated during the transition period as Adams nominated a slew of judges in a move that was seen as an attempt to hamstring his successor. On Inauguration Day, however, Adams stepped aside and Jeffersondelivereda conciliatory address,promisingto protect the rights of those who hadn’t voted for him and calling for Americans to “unite with one heart and one mind.” Although Adams didn’t attend Jefferson’s inauguration—he left the capital by stagecoach that morning—it’s unclear whether that was because of the rancor between the two men or simply because the tradition wasn’t fully established. Jefferson would attend his successor’s inauguration, and the only other outgoing presidents who have skipped it entirely were Adams’ sonJohn Quincy Adamsin 1829 andAndrew Johnsonin 1869. Both men disliked their successors—Andrew Jackson and Ulysses S. Grant, respectively—while Johnson also resented having been impeached by the House of Representatives a year earlier. In 1837, eight years after being snubbed by John Quincy Adams, Jackson not only attended Martin Van Buren’s inauguration but also becamethe first president to accompany his successorto the Capitol. Though it wouldn’t become a consistent tradition until the 20th century, Jackson’s example has been followed even by presidents who didn’t get along—such as Herbert Hoover and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whoshared a silent rideto the Capitol in 1933. A cameraman in front of the dome of the U.S. Capitol Building during the inauguration of President John F. Kennedy on January 20, 1961, in Washington D.C. Inaugurations have become increasingly public since George Washington first swore the oath of office before a crowd. Telecommunications advances—from the telegraph to the television—allowed even more Americans to witness the peaceful transfer of power that occurs every four years at the presidential inauguration. Public school children in New York City wait to watch the televised coverage of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's inauguration on January 20, 1953. Newly elected President George H.W. Bush (left) jams onstage with Republican Committee Chairman Lee Atwater (center), and soul singer Sam Moore (right) at his official inaugural ball on January 21, 1989, in Washington, D.C. Bush hosted nine official inaugural balls that year. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy looks over her shoulder at an inaugural ball after her husband, President John F. Kennedy, took the presidential oath earlier that day on January 20, 1961. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and President-elect John F. Kennedy have their first official meeting at the White House on December 1, 1960, almost two months before Kennedy took office. After Kennedy’s assassination in 1963, Eisenhower helped guide Vice President Lyndon Baines Johnson into office. Most of the other inaugural traditions that are iconic today can also be traced back to Thomas Jefferson. In 1801, he was the first president to be inaugurated at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., which was thenstill under construction. Heinvitedthe U.S. Marine Band to play at the ceremony and gave them the moniker “The President’s Own.” After winning reelection four years later, Jeffersoninspired the inaugural paradewhen a spontaneous gathering of people lined the streets to watch him ride on horseback to the White House—which he then opened to the public for the first inaugural open house. In the years since, inaugural parades have become increasingly elaborate with floats, musical performances, and reviewing stands erected from which presidents watch the hours-long affair. In 1977, Jimmy Carter started the modern tradition of presidents walking back to the White House from the Capitol.As the White House Historical Association explains, Carter sought to signal to Americans that he would be a president who was “available for all citizens.” Parades grew so long that presidents eventually stopped hosting receptions—though not before 1829, when Andrew Jacksonhad to escapea crush of 20,000 well-wishers through a White House window. In 1809, James Madison became the first president to have a formal ball on Inauguration Day. Four hundred guests attended the ball, which washosted byFirst Lady Dolley Madison at a hotel on Capitol Hill. Over the years, the tradition ballooned and, in modern years, there are usually dozens of official and unofficial inaugural balls. Over the years, the ceremonies have become increasingly public affairs, with details shared more widely with each advance in technology. News of the presidential inauguration was first transmitted by telegraph in 1845 (James Polk), national radio broadcast in 1925 (Calvin Coolidge), television in 1949 (Harry Truman), and the internet in 1997 (Bill Clinton). “Over time, what we see is a gradual expansion of having the public more involved as witnesses to history,” Costello says. “Having them be able to hear the inaugural addresses, be able to see the swearing-in ceremony.… It allows them to actually see the transfer of power.” This year’s inauguration will be quite a bit different, with security restrictions due to both the pandemic and threats of violence. But inaugural rites have weathered national crises before—and have at times evolved to meet the moment. In 1861, seven Southern states had just seceded from the Union in protest of the election of the anti-slavery Northerner Abraham Lincoln.According to the Library of Congress, the “federal government was on guard against insurrection and possible assassination attempt on Lincoln. Cannons, primed and loaded, lined Pennsylvania Avenue, and rooftop sharpshooters scoured the crowd of well-wishers below as the presidential party made its way eastward to the U.S. Capitol.” Lincoln nevertheless took the oath of office before the crowd and deliveredan inaugural addressappealing to his countrymen’s “better angels” to be “not enemies, but friends.” Four years later, in the midst of the Civil War, he stood again before a crowd tourge a divided nationto reconcile “with malice toward none; with charity for all.” Lincoln’s second inauguration also marked the first time that African Americans were invited to take part in an inaugural parade. (Past inaugural addresses have shown the way forward through times of crisis.) In 1945, another war prompted Franklin Roosevelt to pare down his fourth inaugural. In its fourth year of fighting World War II, the nation wasrationing supplies, from food to gasoline to firewood. In the spirit of conservation, Roosevelt decided to cancel the inaugural parade and balls and have just a simple public swearing-in at the White House rather than the Capitol. President Abraham Lincoln was sworn into office at the U.S. Capitol Building while it was still under construction on March 4, 1861. Federal officials lined the parade route with cannons and sharpshooters in preparation for a possible insurrection or assassination attempt by Southern sympathizers. Four years into World War II, citizens attend President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's fourth inauguration in 1945. In the spirit of rationing for the war, Roosevelt cancelled the inaugural parade and balls. Officials install parking restriction signs in preparation for President Roosevelt’s pared-down inauguration, which took place at the White House instead of the Capitol Building. A crowd gathers around the White House to attend President Roosevelt’s more intimate fourth inauguration—the first and last fourth inauguration in U.S. history. The 22nd Amendment limiting presidents to two terms in office was ratified in 1951. Several past U.S. vice presidents hademergency swearing-insrather than inaugurations when their predecessors died in office. In 1881, Chester A. Arthur took the oath of office at his home in New York after James Garfield was shot. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Calvin Coolidge also had private swearing-in ceremonies, while Lyndon Johnson took the oath aboard Air Force One after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963. On January 21, 2013, the National Mall was crowded with people who had gathered to watch the second inauguration of President Barack Obama.

        "content": "Strong winds are expected to return Monday through Wednesday. At least27 people have diedas multiple wildfires, fueled by severe drought conditions and strong winds, rage across the Los Angeles area. Thousands of firefighters have been battling wildfires across 45 square miles of densely populated Los Angeles County. At one point, firefighters were battling six blazes at the same time. Initially, more than 200,000 people were under mandatory evacuation orders, but most orders were lifted as fire containment lines were dramatically increased. The two largest fires remain active, the Palisades Fire in Pacific Palisades and the Eaton Fire near Pasadena. ABC News has kicked off \"SoCal Strong\" (#SoCalStrong), highlighting the impacted communities andoffering fundraising opportunitiesfor victims of the fires. The coverage will continue across multiple ABC News programs and platforms. The Palisades Fire, which began in the Pacific Palisades on Jan. 7, has destroyed or damaged over 6,000 structures. It's covered more than 23,700 acres and is at 59% containment. The Eaton Fire north of Pasadena also began on Jan. 7 and has destroyed or damaged more than 10,000 structures. It's burned over 14,000 acres and is at 87% containment. Firefighters battling wildfires in Los Angeles County received a round of applause on Monday during the presidential inauguration of Donald Trump at the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, mentioned the firefighters in a speech, noting that the presidential inauguration is traditionally held at the Capitol, which she called the \"people's house.\" Klobuchar noted that the Capitol is dedicated to normal Americans doing extraordinary things, adding, \"And yes, the firefighters in Los Angeles putting themselves on the line for us.\" As applause broke out, Klobuchar added, \"Our democracy's strength and grit must match there's.\" A large area of Southern California, including fire-ravaged Los Angeles County, was under a \"particularly dangerous situation\" alert on Monday as the National Weather Service forecast the return of strong Santa Ana winds to the region. For an unprecedented fifth time in a single fire season, the NWS issued the rare PDS alert, warning residents of extreme fire danger and to be prepared to evacuate if new fires break out.   In anticipation of the next round of Santa Ana winds forecast for Monday and Tuesday, thousands of firefighters spent the weekend increasing fire containment lines and extinguishing hot spots. As of Monday morning, just two blazes, the Palisades Fire in Pacific Palisades and the Eaton Fire near Pasadena, remain active. But officials said firefighters have gained the upper hand on both wildfires.   Containment of the Palisades Fire is up to 59% while containment of the Eaton Fire grew to 87%, according to the Cal Fire. The Palisades Fire, which started on Jan. 7, has burned 23,713 acres and has destroyed 5,828 structures, including homes and businesses, according to an update from Cal Fire on Monday. At least 10 fire-related deaths have been reported in the Palisades Fire. The Eaton Fire, which also started on Jan. 7, has burned more than 14,000 acres and has destroyed 9,391 structures in the communities of Pasadena and Altadena, according to Cal Fire. At least 17 fatalities have been blamed on the fire. California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday announced that he would deploy additional resources ahead of the extreme fire weather expected this week. A statement from the governor's office said that he is mobilizing and pre-positioning more than 170 fire engines, water tenders, and aircraft to Southern California, along with personnel. It explained that the state is \"surging additional resources to provide rapid-attack capabilities for early fire starts.\" The region can expect possible peak wind speeds of up to 70 mph in the coasts and valleys and 100 mph in the mountains and foothills of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. The National Weather Service has designated this a “Particularly Dangerous Situation.\" It is the fifth such designation since November 2024.   “The recent firestorms in Los Angeles have illustrated the importance of being in the right place at the right time,\" Newsom said in the statement. \"By strategically placing specialized personnel and equipment in areas prone to wildfires, crews are able to respond faster and more aggressively. These conditions are dangerous, so it’s incumbent upon all families to stay vigilant.” The number of resources being deployed for the upcoming weather is twice as high as those allotted when the firestorms broke out on Jan. 7. -ABC News' Marilyn Peck, Matt Gutman, Jenna Harrison and T. Michelle Murphy Southern California is getting a break from the strong winds this weekend, but crews are preparing for the next round of offshore winds from Monday through Wednesday. The outlook for Monday calls for extremely critical fire danger in Santa Clarita, Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks and Burbank. Gusty winds in the mountains could be reaching 80 miles per hour, creating \"conditions supportive of rapid wildfire onset and spread,\" according to the National Weather Service. These strong wind gusts will remain a problem through Wednesday before easing up by the end of the week. -ABC News' Dan Amarante"

        "content": "Fauci has not been charged with a crime but has been vilified and threatened. With just hours left in office, President Joe Biden has issued a preemptive pardon for Anthony Fauci, America's top infectious disease expert. For nearly four decades, Fauci directed the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He advised seven presidents, beginning with Ronald Reagan and, among his many accomplishments, played a crucial role in the response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Fauci was a leading architect of PEPFAR, the global AIDS response program begun by President George W. Bush that is estimated to havesaved 25 million lives. Fauci served as Biden's medical advisor until hisretirement at the end of 2022. \"For more than half a century, Dr. Fauci served our country,\" Biden saidin a statement released this morning. \"He saved countless lives by managing the government’s response to pressing health crises, including HIV/AIDS, as well as the Ebola and Zika viruses. During his tenure as my Chief Medical Advisor, he helped the country tackle a once-in-a-century pandemic. The United States is safer and healthier because of him.\" But, while Fauci was once considered \"America's doctor,\" and a trusted face of public health responses, he became vilified for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, which deeply divided the country. Though he has been charged with no crime, he has continued to face threats of investigations and charges, particularly from the political right. For instance, Elon Musk, who incoming-President Trump has tapped for unofficial federal government positions, has posted several times on social media \"My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci.” Since retiring, Fauci has been under federal protection due todeath threatson his life and the life of his family. In issuing the pardon, Biden emphasized that Fauci is not guilty of any wrongdoing. He justified the uncommon pardon by arguing that it is, essentially, a good-conscience effort to protect from a political witch hunt. \"I believe in the rule of law, and I am optimistic that the strength of our legal institutions will ultimately prevail over politics. But these are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing,\" Biden said. \"Baseless and politically motivated investigations wreak havoc on the lives, safety, and financial security of targeted individuals and their families. Even when individuals have done nothing wrong—and in fact have done the right thing—and will ultimately be exonerated, the mere fact of being investigated or prosecuted can irreparably damage reputations and finances.\" In addition to Fauci, Biden also granted pardons to General Mark Milley, the Members of Congress and staff who served on the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, and the US Capitol and D.C. Metropolitan police officers who testified before the Select Committee. \"The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense,\" Biden said. \"Our nation owes these public servants a debt of gratitude for their tireless commitment to our country.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

But TikTok's claims that the divest-or-sell law violated Americans' free speech rights did not supersede the government's compelling national security interest in blocking a foreign adversary like China from potentially using the app to spy on or influence Americans, SCOTUS ruled. \"We conclude that the challenged provisions do not violate petitioners’ First Amendment rights,\" the SCOTUS opinion said, while acknowledging that \"there is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community.\" Late last year, TikTok and its owner, the Chinese-owned company ByteDance,urgently pushed SCOTUS to intervenebefore the law's January 19 enforcement date. Ahead of SCOTUS' decision, TikTok warned it would have no choice but to abruptly shut down a thriving platform where many Americans get their news, express their views, and make a living. The US had argued the law was necessary to protect national security interestsas the US-China trade war intensifies, alleging that China could use the app to track and influence TikTok's 170 million American users. A lower court had agreed that the US had a compelling national security interest and rejected arguments that the law violated the First Amendment, triggering TikTok's appeal to SCOTUS. Today, the Supreme Court upheld that ruling. According to SCOTUS, the divest-or-sell law is \"content-neutral\" and only triggers intermediate scrutiny. That requires that the law doesn't burden \"substantially more speech than necessary\" to serve the government's national security interests, rather than strict scrutiny which would force the government to protect those interests through the least restrictive means. Further, the government was right to single TikTok out, SCOTUS wrote, due to its \"scale and susceptibility to foreign adversary control, together with the vastswaths of sensitive data the platform collects.\" \"Preventing China from collecting vast amounts of sensitive data from 170 millionUS TikTok users\" is a \"decidedlycontent agnostic\" rationale, justices wrote. \"The Government had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment,\" the opinion said. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew posted astatementon TikTok reacting to the ruling, thanking Trump for committing to \"work with TikTok\" to avoid a shut down and telling users to \"rest assured, we will do everything in our power to ensure our platform thrives\" in the US. First Amendment advocates condemned the SCOTUS ruling. The American Civil Liberties Union called it a \"major blow to freedom of expression online,\" and the Electronic Frontier Foundation's civil liberties director David Greene accused justices of sweeping \"past the undisputed content-based justification for the law\" to \"rule only based on the shaky data privacy concerns.\" While the SCOTUS ruling was unanimous, justice Sonia Sotomayor said that  \"precedent leaves no doubt\" that the law implicated the First Amendment and \"plainly\" imposed a burden on any US company that distributes TikTok's speech and any content creator who preferred TikTok as a publisher of their speech. Similarly concerned was justice Neil Gorsuch, who wrote in his concurring opinion that he harbors \"serious reservations about whether the law before us is 'content neutral' and thus escapes 'strict scrutiny.'\" Gorsuch also said he didn't know \"whether this law will succeed in achieving its ends.\" \"But the question we face today is not the law’s wisdom, only its constitutionality,\" Gorsuch wrote. \"Given just a handful of days after oral argument to issue an opinion, I cannot profess the kind of certainty I would like to have about the arguments and record before us. All I can say is that, at this time and under these constraints, the problem appears real and the response to it not unconstitutional.\" For TikTok and content creators defending the app, the stakes were incredibly high. TikTok repeatedly denied there was any evidence of spying andwarnedthat enforcing the law would allow the government to unlawfully impose \"a massive and unprecedented speech restriction.\" But the Supreme Court declined to order a preliminary injunction to block the law until Trump took office, instead deciding to rush through oral arguments and reach a decision prior to the law's enforcement deadline. Now TikTok has little recourse if it wishes to maintain US operations, as justices suggested during the trial that even if a president chose to not enforce the law, providing access to TikTok or enabling updates could be viewed as too risky for app stores or other distributors. The law at the center of the case—the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act—had strong bipartisan support under the Biden administration. But President-elect Donald Trump said he opposed a TikTok ban, despite agreeing that US national security interests in preventing TikTok spying on or manipulating Americans were compelling. And this week, Senator Ed Markey (D-Mass.) has introduced abill to extend the deadline ahead of a potential TikTok ban, and a top Trump adviser, Congressman Mike Waltz, has said that Trump plans to stop the ban and \"keep TikTok from going dark,\" the BBCreported. Even the Biden administration, whose justice department just finished arguing why the US needed to enforce the law to SCOTUS, \"is considering ways to keep TikTok available,\" sourcestold NBC News. \"What might happen next to TikTok remains unclear,\" Gorsuch noted in the opinion. It will likely soon be clear whether Trump will intervene. Trump filed abriefin December, requesting that the Supreme Court stay enforcement of the law until after he takes office because allegedlyonly he could make a deal to save TikTok. He criticized SCOTUS for rushing the decision and suggested that Congress' passage of the law may have been \"legislative encroachment\" that potentially \"binds his hands\" as president. \"As the incoming Chief Executive, President Trump has a particularly powerful interest in and responsibility for those national-security and foreign-policy questions, and he is the right constitutional actor to resolve the dispute through political means,\" Trump's brief said. TikTok's CEO Chew signaled to users that Trump is expected to step in. \"On behalf of everyone at TikTok and all our users across the country, I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States,\" Chew's statement said. Chew also reminded Trump that he has 60 billion views of his content on TikTok and perhaps stands to lose a major platform through the ban. \"We are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform, one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives,\" Chew said. Trump seemingly has limited options to save TikTok, Forbessuggested. At trial, justices disagreed on whether Trump could legally decide to simply not enforce the law. And efforts to pause enforcement or claim compliance without evidence that ByteDance is working on selling off TikTok could be blocked by the court, analysts said. And while ByteDance has repeatedly said it's unwilling to sell TikTok US, it's possible, one analyst suggested to Forbes, that ByteDance might be more willing to divest \"in exchange for Trump backing off his threat of high tariffs on Chinese imports.\" On Tuesday, a Bloombergreportsuggested that China was considering whetherselling TikTok to Elon Muskmight be a good bargaining chip to de-escalate Trump's attacks in the US-China trade war.

        "source": "https://nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "Unlike roads and utility lines, the past is not as easy to recover and rebuild after disaster strikes. The Los Angeles fires are a soul-crushing and city-defining disaster. Callous voices have called it a city-destroying event, but they don’t know Los Angeles very well. I have friends who lost houses. I have family who were burned out of their home. Los Angeles has lost churches, synagogues, and architecture that are part of our collective history—not just architectural gems, but civic hubs and touchstones for communal memory. In the Pacific Palisades and Malibu, gone is the Will Rogers Western Ranch in the state park that carries the actor's name, where I used to picnic on the lawn with friends. Gone is Moonshadows, a restaurant on the Pacific Coast Highway known for celebrity spotting, but also where I drank beer one afternoon with my wife after a lovely beach day, and sat by the windows, perched above the ocean, thinking how lucky we were to simply be there. Gone are architectural benchmarks like the Keeler House, a post and beam home that Southern California architect Ray Kappe remodeled in the 1990s, and Richard Neutra’s Benedict and Nancy Freedman House, a masterpiece of mid-century residential architecture. In Altadena, one of my favorite, sleepier L.A. towns—also, after 1968’s Fair Housing Act, an enclave for Los Angeles’s Black community—the losses may be unknown to outsiders, but they were precious to us. Gregory Ain’s Park Planned Homes, a radical post-war experiment in building affordable prefab homes, are gone. Restaurants like Side Pie, a backyard pizza operation—later, a full-blown storefront—that soothed many during Covid, including me. Or the Bunny Museum, which was just as quirky as the name suggests, almost quintessentially L.A.-weird: a world-record accumulation of more than 45,000 pieces of rabbit memorabilia, all reportedly mostly lost to the flames. In multiple cases, rebuilding funds are being raised—my social media is one GoFundMe appeal after another—but there’s no guarantee for return. These places are more than just buildings. The language of architecture, stresses, loads, shear forces, suggests how we emotionally experience spaces we inhabit, and are transformed by them. Octavia Butler, the great science fiction author, wrote in the opening of 1993’s Parable of the Sower, a postapocalyptic novel about a Los Angeles engulfed by fire, “All that you touch you change. All that you change changes you.”I know my own evolution through places—the suburbs where I grew up in Connecticut, a studio in Greenwich Village where I lived on my own for the first time. Houses become homes; rooms contain memories. The meanings we create and take from our corner coffeeshops or the restaurants that feed us, are suffused with sensory impressions, suggesting that when those places are destroyed, a part of us departs, too. I recently met a friend for coffee who grew up in the Palisades. “I haven’t even begun to process that my entire childhood is gone,” he said. The scale of the fires in Los Angeles has been difficult to comprehend, even for those of us who live here. The city is a singular American experiment in communal living. It is varied, diverse, and vast—simultaneously urban, suburban, and rural (not to mention the only major metropolis in the United States cleaved by a mountain range). Greater Los Angeles, what’s meant by “L.A.,” is nearly 20 million people—going by land, it’s the largest metro region in the United States. One of the few moments that I’ve laughed in the past two weeks was when I saw a post on social media suggesting that confused New Yorkers, to grasp the conflagration, might imagine Central Park on fire. With around 40,000 acres burned and 12,000 structures destroyed, make it more like 47 Central Parks. This moment will be a defining one for Los Angeles. Not only in how we move forward, but also for how we preserve what’s been lost—something that L.A. isn’t particularly good at with our predilection for boom and bust, living in constant flux, knocking things down to build anew. Amanda Barnes, the amateur historian behind the popular Instagram account CahuengaPast, named for the street that runs through the Hollywood Hills, agreed. “We have a short attention span and love to plant a new flag,” she said. “Los Angeles loves new ideas, trendsetting. It's the most consistent thing about L.A.” Barnes started her project in 2020, to document untold stories of homes in the neighborhood where she lives. “I describe this project as an intersection of architectural history, the metaphysical, and old celebrity scandal over the last 100 years,” she said. “There's a certain energy in this particular part of the Hollywood Hills, and the houses act as gatekeepers.” As a gatekeeper herself, Barnes digs through archives and old newspapers to surface all the gossip and swindles that can define a property—for example, making the connections between Neutra, author Aldous Huxley, and Krotona, the former home of Beachwood Canyon’s Theosophical Society, an esoteric, early 20thcentury religious movement. (Incidentally, the Theosophical Library Center in Altadena is now also gone.) It’s all done in a spirit of celebration, though the project’s beginnings have a poignant source. Barnes lost her husband to leukemia in 2014. They met nine years earlier, and used to walk the Hills together, gathering information about homes just for fun. “Once CahuengaPast became an actual growing project, I realized I was more content and happy than I had been since before he was sick,” she told me. “That in talking about the ghosts of the Hills, by discovering and championing their forgotten accomplishments and trials, I had inadvertently helped me find a deeper peace with my own.” “It's such a great pleasure showing people how beautiful Los Angeles is—the nature, the scope, the quirky details, the architectural patterns and trends per era,” she added. “It's an incredible community.” Memories are as much the raw material of cities as concrete and steel. Thanks to oral history efforts like Barnes’, and the work of L.A.’s architectural and historical societies, our collective memory is reinforced—the physical and tangible, but also the abstract and illusory—even as fire continues to loom. Six years ago, in the fall of 2018, when the Woolsey Fire burned down nearly a hundred thousand acres, I was reporting my most recent book, an investigation into what it means to live in L.A., and I heard about a guy named Robert Spangle. Spangle graduated from Malibu High School in the mid-aughts and enlisted in the Marines Corps, completing tours in Afghanistan. During Woolsey, he put his training to use, sneaking behind police lines to join a crew of young surfers who were driving around the hills in pick-up trucks, putting fires out by hand. As a Marine, Spangle had been a radio telephone operator, managing his unit’s communications. During Woolsey, he dragged a camp table and sleeping bag up to the top of Point Dume, a prominent overlook above the Pacific, and kept watch for days, radioing down to the surfers whenever he spotted new fires breaking out. “I’ve been losing a lot of sleep the past few days,” Spangle said when I reached him last week. Today, he works as a photojournalist and designer, and he was in Italy when we spoke, preparing a small collection for Florence’s fashion week. “Part of [my fatigue] is dreams recalling Woolsey, and the other part is just anxiety over not being there, seeing friends lose homes and businesses.” Like all Angelenos, fire is familiar to Spangle. He remembered watching his parents prep the house and pack essentials while knowing that if the mountains did catch fire, his father would stay behind, despite evacuation orders, to defend their property. Spangle called it “the Malibu way.” In fact, when he was older and a fire rolled through, he thought of it as a rite of passage: his father allowing him to stay behind and help, while his mother and little brother evacuated. Now, years later, watching the news from thousands of miles away, he felt powerless. “I miss Malibu every single day, strangely even more during fires,” he said. “Community really is the irreplaceable thing.” Last week I passed a man playing ukelele in his sedan, with every inch of his car stuffed with belongings. Was he homeless before the fires? Was he a victim of these past two weeks? In present-day Los Angeles, it’s impossible to tell. It’s now day ten that I’ve had a go-bag in hand when I leave my apartment—a backpack stuffed with toiletries, backup batteries, important documents. As someone lucky enough to not live in an area that burned, I’m grappling with survivor’s guilt in different ways. I refresh fire- and air-monitoring apps constantly and pray for rain. While writing this piece, two fires started near me, though they were quickly (luckily) put out. I volunteer, I donate, I’ve made it mandatory to read the obituaries trickling in, as the dead are identified and described. But several times I’ve hit a wall. Running around for days, suddenly I’m barely able to get out of bed, staring at the ceiling, exhausted like I’ve rarely felt. The skylines east and west of my apartment are no longer filled with smoke. I look forward to getting back into the mountains, hiking the trails, saying good morning to people I pass. To borrow from Spangle, what is the “Los Angeles way” in this scenario? For all the losses, the past weeks have seen inspiring examples of resilience and humanity: neighbors helping neighbors, strangers becoming friends. Los Angeles will rebuild, we always do. New buildings will go up where old ones stood, and they’ll be different—we may not be able to replace icons of mid-century architecture, but we can design structures to better withstand future burns. And hopefully, when the fires return, all the linking arms and memory-making of this moment will leave us stronger and better prepared. L.A.’s potential remains immense.

        "content": "Cecile Richards, a national leader for women’s rights who led Planned Parenthood for 12 tumultuous years, has died CONCORD, N.H. --Cecile Richards, a national leader for abortion access and women’s rights who led Planned Parenthood for 12 tumultuous years, has died. She was 67. Richards died Monday at home “surrounded by family and her ever-loyal dog, Ollie,” her family said in a statement. “Our hearts are broken today but no words can do justice to the joy she brought to our lives,” the family said. Richards, the daughter of the late Texas Gov. Ann Richards, was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, in 2023, five years aftershe left Planned Parenthood. Though Planned Parenthood also provides birth control, cancer screenings and testing for sexually transmitted diseases at clinics nationwide, its status as the nation’s leading abortion provider has long made it a lightning rod for debate. Richards played a prominent role in pushing back against criticism during her tenure as president and beyond. In 2015, she spent hoursanswering hostile questionsfrom Republican U.S. House members who later created an investigative panel to probe Planned Parenthood’s abortion and fetal-tissue policies. In 2021,she warnedthat the U.S. Supreme Court’s inaction on Texas’ restrictive abortion law could signal the end of judicial checks and balances on the issue. And after the courtoverturned Roe v. Wadein 2022, she continued to speak out. “One day, our children and grandchildren may ask us, ‘When it was all on the line, what did you do?’” she said at the Democratic National Convention in August. “The only acceptable answer is, ‘Everything we could.’” President Joe Biden, who awarded Richards the Presidential Medal of Freedom in November, on Monday called her a “leader of utmost character.” “Cecile fearlessly led us forward to be the America we say we are,” he said in a statement. “Carrying her mom’s torch for justice, she championed some of our Nation’s most important civil rights causes. She fought for the dignity of workers, defended and advanced women’s reproductive rights and equality, and mobilized our fellow Americans to exercise their power to vote.” Alexis McGill Johnson, current president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, called Richards an “indomitable force.” “As we continue to navigate uncharted territory, we will be able to meet the challenges we face in large part because of the movement Cecile built over decades,” she said. “I know, without a doubt, that Cecile would tell us the best way to honor her memory is to suit up — preferably in pink — link arms, and fight like hell for Planned Parenthood patients across the country.” In her Democratic convention speech, Richards described the joy of becoming a grandmother in 2023 and quoted her mother when referring to Kamala Harris' presidential campaign as a “celebration of women.” “As my mother, Gov. Ann Richards, would say, ‘I hear America singing,'\" she said. “When women are free to make their own decisions about their lives and to follow our dreams, we are unstoppable.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(Al Drago/Pool Photo via AP)     In his first address after beingsworn inon Monday, President Donald Trump repeated several false and misleading statements that he made during his campaign. They included claims about immigration, the economy, electric vehicles and the Panama Canal. Here’s a look at the facts.    CLAIM: Trump, a Republican, said that the U.S. government “fails to protect our magnificent, law-abiding American citizens but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions that have illegally entered our country from all over the world.”  THE FACTS: There is no evidence other countries are sending their criminals or mentally ill across the border.  Trump frequently brought up this claim during his most recent campaign.    CLAIM: “I will direct all members of my Cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices.”  THE FACTS: Inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 after rising steadily in the first 17 months of Democrat Joe Biden’s presidency from a low of 0.1% in May 2020. Themost recent datashows that as of December it had fallen to 2.9%.  Other historical periods have seen higher inflation, such as a more than 14% rate in 1980, according to the Federal Reserve.  The average price ofbasic consumer goodshas seen major spikes in recent years. For example, a dozen large eggs went from a low of $1.33 in August 2020 to $4.82 in January 2023. They decreased in price to $2.07 in September 2023 but are currently on the rise again, at $4.15 as of December, partly attributable to a lingering outbreak of bird flu coinciding with high demand during the holiday baking season.   A gallon of whole milk rose to a high of $4.22 in November 2022, up from $2.25 at the start of Biden’s term. As of December, it was at $4.10.  Gasoline fell as low as $1.77 a gallon under Trump. But that price dip happened during coronavirus pandemic lockdowns when few people were driving. The low prices were due to a global health crisis, not Trump’s policies.  Under Biden, gasoline rose to a high of $5.06 in June 2022. It has since been on a downward trend, at $3.15 as of December.      CLAIM: Promising to establish an External Revenue Service to collect “all tariffs, duties, and revenues,” Trump said, “It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our Treasury, coming from foreign sources.”  THE FACTS: Nearly all economists point out that American consumers will pay at least part, if not most, of the cost of the tariffs. Some exporters overseas may accept lower profits to offset some of the cost of the duties, and the dollar will likely rise in value compared with the currencies of the countries facing tariffs, which could also offset some of the impact.  But the tariffs won’t have the desired impact of spurring more production in the U.S. unless they make foreign-made products more expensive for U.S. consumers.  In addition, many of Trump’s supporters, and even some of his appointees, argue that he intends to use tariffs primarily as a bargaining tool to extract concessions from other countries. Yet if an External Revenue Service is established, it certainly suggests Trump is expecting to impose and collect many duties.      CLAIM: “We will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving the auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers.”  THE FACTS: It’s misleading to claim that such a mandate exists. In April 2023, the Environmental Protection Agencyannounced strict limitson greenhouse gas emissions from passenger vehicles. The agency says these limits could be met if 67% of new-vehicle sales are electric by 2032.  And yet, the new rule would not require automakers to boost electric vehicle sales directly. It sets emissions limits and allows automakers to choose how to meet them.  In 2019, Kamala Harris co-sponsoreda billas a U.S. senator calledthe Zero-Emission Vehicles Actthat would have required 100% of new passenger vehicles sold to be zero-emission by 2040. The bill, which stalled in committee, did not ban ownership of vehicles that produce emissions.      CLAIM: Discussing his desire for the U.S. to take back the Panama Canal: “American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form, and that includes the United States Navy. And, above all, China is operating the Panama Canal.”  THE FACTS: Officials in Panama have denied Trump’s claims that China is operating the canal and that the U.S. is being overcharged. Ricaurte Vásquez, administrator of the canal, said inan interviewwith The Associated Press that “there’s no discrimination in the fees.”  “The price rules are uniform for absolutely all those who transit the canal and clearly defined,” he said.  He also said China was not operating the canal. He noted Chinese companies operating in the ports on either end of the canal were part of a Hong Kong consortium that won a bidding process in 1997. He added that U.S. and Taiwanese companies are operating other ports along the canal as well.  Vásquez stressed that the canal can’t give special treatment to U.S.-flagged ships because of a neutrality treaty. He said requests for exceptions are routinely rejected, because the process is clear and there mustn’t be arbitrary variations. The only exception in the neutrality treaty is for American warships, which receive expedited passage.  Trump, complaining about rising charges for ships transiting the canal, has refused to rule outthe use of military forceto seize control of the canal.  The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.

All Rights Reserved. “Nosferatu” writer-director Robert Eggers and stars Lily-Rose Depp, Nicholas Hoult and Willem Dafoe sat down with Associated Press entertainment journalist Krysta Fauria to talk about what makes their adaptation of the classic vampire film unique — and how Eggers builds sprawling cinematic worlds.  Adria Arjona’s big year included roles in Richard Linklater’s “Hit Man” opposite Glen Powell, “The Absence of Eden” alongside Zoe Saldaña — and Zoë Kravitz’s directorial debut “Blink Twice.” She’s now celebrating the release of “Los Frikis,” which she also executive produced, and returns next year to the acclaimed Star Wars series “Andor.” After being named one of AP’s Breakthrough Entertainers of 2024, the 32-year-old star sat down with AP entertainment journalist Leslie Ambriz to talk about her journey into film and TV, her mother’s on-set support, and boosting Latin American stories in Hollywood.  How many roads must a man walk down to play Bob Dylan? Quite a few, at least, if you’re Timothée Chalamet. Off and on for some six years, the 28-year-old star has been obsessively working toward his performance in “A Complete Unknown.” Chalamet spoke with AP film writer Jake Coyle about his favorite Dylan songs, traveling to Hibbing, Minn. as part of his research, and what artists like Frank Ocean share in common with the iconic folk rocker.  Aaron Pierre is closing out his big year on a literal high note. After playing Malcolm X in the “Genius: MLK/X” series and starring in the Netflix action hit “Rebel Ridge,” he showcases his vocal talents in “Mufasa: The Lion King.” The the 30-year-old English actor, named an AP Breakthrough Entertainer of 2024, sat down with AP entertainment editor Ryan Pearson to talk about his upbringing in South London, FaceTiming with his mom and “throwing the baseball” with Lin-Manuel Miranda.  “Queer” star Daniel Craig says the secret to filming intimate scenes with co-star Drew Starkey was to keep things light. In an interview with AP entertainment journalist Krysta Fauria, the pair discussed working with an intimacy coordinator, Luca Guadagnino’s directing style — and the legacy of Beat Generation writer and “Queer” author William S. Burroughs.  Country music comes naturally to Ringo Starr. The former Beatle has dabbled in the music ever since singing the country hit “Act Naturally” with the Beatles in 1965, and he’s now about to release a whole country album. Starr says in an interview with The Associated Press’ Andrew Dalton that he’s put a bit of country in most everything he’s done, so the album wasn’t too big a stretch. Starr says the project began when he bumped into his friend, classic country aficionado T-Bone Burnett, and asked him to write a song. Burnett came back with nine. The resulting album, “Look Up,” comes out in January.  Erykah Badu has been a music disruptor, culture shifter and style maven ever since she stepping into the limelight with her 1997 debut album, “Baduizm.” The four-time Grammy winner, who was recently honored with the CFDA (Council of Fashion Designers of America) Icon award, sat down with AP entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton to talk about her fashion influence, working on new music, her appearance in “The Piano Lesson” —and finally learning to stop and smell the flowers.  Paul Mescal plays the titular gladiator Lucius and Denzel Washington is aspiring emperor Macrinus in Ridley Scott’s Roman epic “Gladiator II.” The two stars sat down with AP entertainment journalist Sian Watson in London to talk about robes, bulking up, their 86-year-old director — and working with friends and family.  Thirty years after the Oscar-winning “Forrest Gump,” Tom Hanks and Robin Wright have joined once again with director Robert Zemeckis for the family drama “Here.” It’s Hanks’ fifth film with Zemeckis and Wright’s fourth. They sat down with AP entertainment editor Ryan Pearson to discuss their previous collaborations: “Gump” (both, 1994), “Cast Away” (Hanks, 2000), “The Polar Express” (Hanks, 2004), “Beowulf” (Wright, 2007), “A Christmas Carol” (Wright, 2009) and “Pinocchio” (Hanks, 2022).  Tim Heidecker is working through his existential dread, in the form of song. Best known for his absurdist comedy, he’s leaned more into songwriting in recent years. He sat down with AP entertainment journalist Krysta Fauria to talk about his latest album “Slipping Away,” which moves between semi-fictional apocalyptic storytelling and poignant, vulnerable reflections on fatherhood, aging and success.  Mikey Madison stars in “Anora” as a Brooklyn exotic dancer who spontaneously marries the son of a Russian oligarch. She sat down with AP entertainment journalist Krysta Fauria to talk about how she landed the role with writer-director Sean Baker, preparing her little brother for a screening, improv — and the challenge of pole dancing.  Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh star in John Crowley’s “We Live In Time,” which tells the story of a relationship over the course of a decade. The two actors sat down with AP film writer Jake Coyle to talk about on-screen chemistry, processing the heavier moments of the film — and that infamous carousel horse meme.  N.T. Rama Rao Jr. is following up the international success of “RRR” with the action-drama “Devara: Part 1,” in which he plays both a mythical hero and a son struggling with his dad’s legacy. Rama Rao says Los Angeles has become his “lucky charm” after last year’s trip to the Oscars — where “Naatu Naatu” won best song — and a subsequent invitation to join the U.S. film academy. The 41-year-old, whose father and grandfather were both prominent actors and political leaders, sat down with AP entertainment editor Ryan Pearson to talk about his own perspective on fatherhood, filming crowd-pleasing underwater scenes, staying “innocent” as an actor — and his love for the Will Smith film “The Pursuit of Happiness.”  RZA’s hoarding habit led to his newest adventure in music: a ballet and surprisingly traditional classical music album he calls “A Ballet Through Mud.” He sat down with AP entertainment editor Ryan Pearson to talk about the nostalgic genesis of the project, the growing bridge between the worlds of classical and hip-hop, and his hopes for what happens next with his composition and ballet.  After releasing 18 albums over more than two decades, Xiu Xiu is still making music for outsiders. With the release of “13'’ Frank Beltrame Italian Stiletto with Bison Horn Grips,” band leader Jamie Stewart spoke with AP entertainment journalist Krysta Fauria about balancing harmony and dissonance, moving to Berlin — and why the band “wouldn’t exist” without David Lynch’s “Twin Peaks” universe.  Usher’s new concert film ‘Usher: Rendezvous in Paris’ is playing in theaters through Sunday. The R&B star sat down with AP entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton to talk about the significance of his Paris concert and the resulting film, recent online discussion about successors to Michael Jackson, and chasing the success of his “Confessions” album.  Brandy stars alongside Kathryn Hunter in A24’s horror film “The Front Room.” The two actors spoke with AP entertainment journalist Leslie Ambriz about decompressing after dark scenes, Brandy’s past forays into the horror genre — and filming in a haunted house.  Kathy Bates had “one foot out the door” and was ready to retire after recovering from cancer and an emotionally draining film project. Then she joined “Matlock.” The 76-year-old star says she’s been rejuvenated by the legal procedural series’ creator and her co-stars. She sat down with AP entertainment journalist Kaitlyn Huamani to talk about learning to trust again in Hollywood, working with Ryan Murphy and Dustin Hoffman — and the value of storytelling.  Six years after “A Star is Born,” Lady Gaga returns to the Venice Film Festival with “Joker: Folie à Deux” alongside Joaquin Phoenix and director Todd Phillips. She sat down with AP film writer Lindsey Bahr to talk about creating a new voice for her Lee/Harley Quinn character, writing a “waltz that falls apart” for the film — and why it’s an “exciting time” in pop music. Phillips shares why he chose her for the role, singing on set — and using the film to pose the question: “What is entertainment?”  Angelina Jolie portrays renowned opera singer Maria Callas in Pablo Larraín’s “Maria,” focusing on her life in Paris in the 70s before her death at age 53. They sat down with AP entertainment editor Louise Dixon at the Venice Film Festival to discuss how Jolie connected with Callas, the difficulty of performing opera — and why the film, to be released on Netflix, is the most personal of Larraín’s biopic trilogy that includes “Spencer” and “Jackie.”  Nearly a decade after his last full-length release, Zedd is releasing “Telos.” The Grammy-winning producer/DJ says he needed to push himself to make an album that would move the needle — one that told a story beyond the success of his debut LP, “Clarity,” or “True Colors.” The German dance-pop maverick says the album — which features collaborators ranging from Muse and John Mayer to Remi Wolf and Bea Miller — is “an album that for many years I doubted I could create.” He spoke with AP entertainment journalist Rick Taber about the long process of creating “Telos,” being inspired by Jeff Buckley and the state of EDM.  “Only Murders in the Building” has become a “safe place” for Selena Gomez as the hit Hulu comedy enters its fourth season. She sat down alongside co-stars and longtime friends Steve Martin and Martin Short to speak with AP entertainment journalist Leslie Ambriz about on-set confidence, finding your ‘number one’ in the industry and more.  “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” stars Jenna Ortega, Catherine O’Hara and Winona Ryder sat down with AP entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton to talk about the significance and pressure of releasing a sequel 36 years after the original 1988 horror comedy hit, their bonds with director Tim Burton — and O’Hara’s thoughts on working again with “Home Alone” co-star Macaulay Culkin.  Tinashe thought she might have hit on her hands with “Nasty” — but never expected it become such a viral success. The R&B and pop star spoke with the AP’s Gary Gerard Hamilton about her new album “Quantum Baby,” how she now defines success, and maintaining career momentum over the years through changes in the the music industry.  MTV’s “The Challenge” is looking back as it celebrates 26 years of big personalities and big drama. The reality competition series’ stars Johnny “Bananas” Devenanzio, Aneea Ferreira and Nurys Mateo — along with host TJ Lavin — sat down with AP entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton to talk about the 40th season, which features 40 returning competitors in a “Battle of the Eras.”  Michael Keaton says it would have been a “huge mistake” for his titular trickster ghost character to get significantly more screen time in “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” than he did in the first film. The 72-year-old star sat down with AP entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton to talk about why he was nervous to return for the sequel featuring Jenna Ortega and Winona Ryder, the impact of Tim Burton’s original 1988 horror comedy — and why he never thought of himself as playing Batman.  Justin Baldoni’s “It Ends With Us” journey began well before Colleen Hoover’s novel became a sensation on TikTok. The 40-year-old actor and filmmaker optioned the book in 2019 while he was shooting “Jane The Virgin” and preparing to release his feature film directorial debut, “Five Feet Apart.” Five years later, he spoke with AP entertainment journalist Alicia Rancilio about directing and co-starring alongside Blake Lively in the drama that revolves around domestic violence.  It is not easy to be an outsider in country music, but Orville Peck has made a career out of it. On his third album, “Stampede,” his nonconformist spirit has led to collaborations with everyone from Willie Nelson and Elton John to Mickey Guyton and Kylie Minogue. The 36-year-old South African musician has been steadily stripping back his mask since his 2019 debut album “Pony.” Peck spoke with AP music journalist Maria Sherman about his growing confidence, his high-profile collaborations and country radio.  Josh Hartnett is looking back at shedding his Hollywood heartthrob image in the 2000s as he stars in M. Night Shyamalan’s thriller “Trap.” Hartnett is now 46 and lives in England with his wife and four children. While he’s been working steadily since breaking out in 1998 with a “Halloween” sequel and “The Faculty,” he intentionally moved away from studio movies and leading man roles after being typecast as his fame grew with movies like “Black Hawk Down” and “Pearl Harbor.” In “Trap,” Hartnett plays a father with a secret who takes his daughter to a pop concert — which is surrounded by police searching for a serial killer.  M. Night Shyamalan has been at least partly self-financing his films since 2015’s “The Visit,” risking his own money on box office success. His latest is “Trap,” starring Josh Hartnett as a father with a secret and Shyamalan’s daughter Saleka as a pop star whose concert is surrounded by police looking to capture a serial killer. Shyamalan spoke with AP entertainment editor Ryan Pearson about his high-risk, high-reward, lower-budget filmmaking approach, guiding his daughters’ artistic pursuits — and his philosophy that “talent is process.”  Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

        "content": "I'm not sure why you'd want to do both at the same time, but this EV could. The battery system on an electric car can either charge—from regenerative braking or an external power supply—or discharge—powering the EV's motor(s) or supplying that power via so-called vehicle-to-load. As a rule, it can't do both at once, but General Motors has some thoughts about that. The patent analysis siteCarMosesspotted a recent GMpatent applicationfor a system that is capable of charging and discharging simultaneously. The patent describes a \"charging system\" with a pair of charging ports. One is for drawing power from an external source, just like every other EV. The second charge port is connected to a bi-directional charger, and the battery management system is able to charge the battery pack from the first port while also supplying power from the second port. That second port could be used to charge another battery, including the battery of another EV, and the patent includes an illustration of three EVs daisy-chained to each other. Credit:USPTO The idea of two charge ports on an EV is not unheard of; Porsche'sTaycan(and the relatedAudi e-tron GT) have one on each side, and it's an option on the newerPPE-based EVsfrom those brands, if I'm not mistaken. I have no idea whether GM's patent will show up on a production EV—car companies patent many more ideas than they ever get around to building, after all. And I must admit, I'm not entirely sure what the use case is beyond seeing how long of an EV-centipede you could make by plugging one into another into another, and so on. But I am intrigued.

        "content": "He spoke after taking the presidential oath for a second time at the Capitol. At noon today, Donald Trump took the presidential oath for a second time, capping a historic political comeback to the White House. As he did on the campaign trail, Trump painted a dark picture of America and took aim at President Joe Biden's leadership as his predecessor sat just steps away. \"My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal, and all of these many betrayals that have taken place, and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and indeed their freedom,\" Trump said, promising a \"golden age of America.\" The flag at the White House has been raised after Trump signed a proclamation for flags to be flown at full staff on all inauguration days.   The flag had been at half-staff following President Jimmy Carter’s death on Dec. 29. Trump is ordering the flag to return to half-staff on Tuesday for the remainder of the 30-day period, which began the day of 100-year-old Carter’s death. Last week, House Speaker Mike Johnson ordered that the flags at the Capitol be raised for the inauguration. -ABC News’ Justin Ryan Gomez With a flurry of executive orders expected today, President Donald Trump's top advisers, including his incoming Department of Justice leadership, are preparing for a storm of legal challenges to some of the most controversial ones. \"We're going to get sued on all of these things,\" one top Trump adviser said, adding that the volume of litigation is expected to be a full-time job for Trump's DOJ.   Trump has privately told advisers that he believes flooding the zone with executive orders will lead to lawsuits that may be less effective given the volume of actions he plans to take. During Trump's first administration, he faced upwards of 400 lawsuits challenging his actions. His advisers anticipate more than that this time. There will be a team inside the Justice Department that is dedicated just to defending Trump's actions in court, sources said. -ABC News’ Katherine Faulders Thetransition from the Biden White House to the Trump White Houseis well underway and crews are working quickly to make the changes before Trump arrives later this afternoon, but the choices are nearly identical to his first term.   In the Oval Office, gold curtains have returned behind the Resolute Desk, as well as the red-and-beige carpet with green leaves that covered the wood floor. As Trump sits at his desk, the portrait of President Andrew Jackson returned to the wall on his left side, just as it was during his first term. Biden had a portrait of Benjamin Franklin. To Trump’s right, where Biden hung a 1917 flag-decorated Childe Hassam painting, President Abraham Lincoln is now back on display. Other areas of the West Wing still need to be unboxed. In the Cabinet Room is a cardboard box with \"DJT Office Bibles\" written on the side. -ABC News’ Justin Ryan Gomez Members of Congress, officials joining the new administration and tech leaders including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg have congregated for an inauguration luncheon at the Capitol.           Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who chairs the Inaugural committee, is seated between Trump and Vance."

Great for:Savers who already have a nest egg built up When you opt for an MMA with First Foundation, you’ll get an APY rate of 4.75%. However, to open an account, you’ll need to have a nest egg already built up: the minimum opening deposit is $1000, and the money cannot come from an account you’ve already got open with First Foundation Bank. Whenever you’re ready to access the money in your account, you can do so with a debit card, available by request, or checks. Unlike many major banks, First Foundation Bank doesn’t run credit checks for you to open an MMA. This means if other banks have declined you, you have a good chance for approval. Once you’ve been approved, you can add beneficiaries or a joint signer. You cannot, however, have the name in a trust. As soon as you make a deposit, your money begins to earn interest. This interest compounds daily and will post at the end of the month. Learn more:Read ourFirst Foundation Bank review Aside from MMAs, First Foundation offers CDs, checking, and savings accounts. Redneck Bank is the online banking division of All America Bank—a bank first established in Oklahoma in 1969. Its motto is “where bankin’s funner,” and its website features farm animals, complete with a housefly that moves across the page as you navigate the site. Great for:Savers who have at least $500 on hand at Bankrate There’s a saying that you shouldn’t be all things to all people, and Redneck Bank has certainly found its niche. Its brand is kitschy and more than a little redneck. On its Mega Money Market sales page, you can see an animated squirrel mowing a lawn of dollar bills as it pushes the lawnmower across the page, complete with sound effects. In a field where banking is filled with blue-and-white, early-internet-style websites, Redneck Bank’s vibrant and playful approach brings a refreshing change. Its debit card has a goat, a squirrel holding a fishing pole, and a pig, and you can use these at ATMs worldwide. Although this account requires at least $500 to open, its other features may make it worth the trade-off. The account comes with a high 4.4% APY, which is among the top on our list. In addition, you won’t pay any maintenance fees. Some of the other notable benefits of this account include a Mastercard debit card, checks, and up to six monthly withdrawals.

It’s backed by Massachusetts-based Peoples Bank and offers three products: a savings account, checking account, and MMA. Great for:Savers who can keep $100 in their account at Bankrate Why we picked it The Zynlo MMA made our list because it had a high 5% APY, $10 minimum deposit, and no monthly maintenance fees. Another notable benefit of this account is that there are no monthly withdrawal limits, unlike some of the other banks on our list. The one drawback? Zynlo doesn’t offer check or debit card access with its MMAs. Despite this restriction, its high-yield APY significantly outperforms the national average, which helps your money grow faster. Because there is no minimum balance requirement, you can start earning more on your money, even if it’s as little as $10.

You won’t pay any monthly service charges, so your money can grow without added fees eating away at it.

You can set up bill pay on your MMA, which allows 10 free online bill pays per month. It will cost you 50 cents for each additional bill pay. E-statements are free; however, if you opt for paper statements, it’s $3 per month. Learn more:Read ourAll America Bank review All America Bank offers checking, savings, CDs, IRAs, and credit cards. Founded in 1998, EverBank, formerly known as TIAA Bank, is a Jacksonville, Florida-based bank offering CDs, high-yield savings accounts, checking accounts, and more. It sponsors EverBank Stadium, where the NFL’s Jacksonville Jaguars play. Great for:Savers who don’t want to worry about fees or minimum opening deposits Why we picked it EverBank’s MMA offers a solid 4.3% introductory one-year APY for first-time money market clients, regardless of how much you have to invest. After the first year, you’ll get a 3.75% APY for balances below $50,000 and a higher rate if you maintain a larger balance. You’ll get a debit card and checks, which means accessing your money is simple. If you have a lot to deposit, you’ll earn better rates. For deposits of $50,000 to $99,999.99, you can earn 4.05% APY, while balances of $100,000 and above receive an impressive 4.30% APY. This tiered structure rewards higher balances and ensures that your money works harder for you. There is no minimum opening deposit, however, so if you only have a few dollars to deposit, you’ll still earn a great rate so your money can grow. You’ll also still get bill pay, mobile check deposits, and ATM fee reimbursements up to $15 monthly. Learn more:Read ourEverBank review As a traditional bank, EverBank offers checking, savings, CDs, and MMAs. “I opened my first MMA a few months ago and, so far, it’s been a good alternative to a traditional savings account. The APY is far higher than any I’ve ever earned, so I’ve moved most of my money into the account to take advantage.” With inflation cooling, theFederal Reservecut the interest rate by 50 basis points at its meeting on September 18th, 2024, and it has hinted at further rate drops in the near future. The Fed’s decision to begin cutting rates can indirectly lower the yields of money market accounts, as these accounts often track short-term interest rates. Monitor how these changes may affect your potential returns for MMAs. While not all financial institutions adjust their rates immediately after a Fed rate cut, it’s worth comparing offers among online and traditional banks to find the best rate available. A money market account is like a combination betweena checking accountand a savings account. These accounts typically offer higher APYs than checking accounts and, in many cases, identical features—check-writing abilities, debit card access, and the ability to make withdrawals and deposits via ATM. However, unlike checking accounts, there may be a limit on the number of withdrawals—usually six—made from your money market account each month. And not all money market accounts come with all the features mentioned above. It’s also not unusual for money market accounts to be tiered, offering higher APYs on higher balances. There may also be a minimum opening deposit or a balance you must maintain to avoid paying maintenance fees. Before opening a money market account, it’s essential to shop around and research APYs, fees, and other features to ensure you find the best account fit for your finances. With inflation at 3.3% year-over-year, the Federal Reserve’s June 11-12, 2024, decision to maintain the federal funds rate of 5.25% to 5.5% is a cautious approach. This means your MMA APY rates may remain high for the time being, but once the Fed cuts rates, you can expect these MMA rates to decline as well. Money market accounts are useful financial tools, offering higher APYs than traditional checking or savings accounts. But it’s important to understand some of thepros and consbefore opening one. One of the primary advantages of money market accounts is that they provide higher interest rates than other deposit accounts. While there may be a limit on the number of withdrawals you can make each month, your money is easily accessible—many money market accounts offer debit or ATM cards and check-writing access, so you can tap into your money when you need it. MMAs can be pricey, and you may need to have a certain amount of money saved up to open an account. Some financial institutions have minimum opening deposit requirements for MMAs, which can range from just a few dollars to thousands. Plus, after you open an account, there may be a minimum balance requirement you need to maintain as well. Some banks and credit unions charge a monthly maintenance fee just for having an account. However, that fee may be waived for some accounts if the customer meets a minimum balance requirement. Lastly, some money market accounts limit customers to just six withdrawals per month. If you want unlimited access to your cash, a checking account could be a better option. When deciding between money market accounts, you’ll want to consider various account features such as: Think of a money market as a hybrid between a savings account and a checking account: You can earn a solid interest rate on your savings and access your cash when needed. When deciding which deposit account is best for you—a savings account, CD, or checking account—you should consider your financial goals, how much liquidity you need, and whether you want a fixed or variable interest rate. There are many similarities betweenmoney market accounts and savings accounts: Both offer higher APYs than checking accounts, are covered FDIC or NCUA insurance, and typically have monthly withdrawal limits However, there are some small differences between the two accounts. With a money market account, customers typically have easy access to cash via ATM, debit card, or checks. Yet with a savings account, customers are typically limited to accessing their cash via electronic transfer. While money market accounts offer variable APYs,CDsprovide a fixed interest rate when you lock up your money for a set amount of time, usually a few months or years. CDs, unlike money market accounts, offer no liquidity—if you need to access your cash before the CD’s term is up, you’ll have to pay anearly withdrawal penaltywhich is worth a few months of interest. Since CDs require you to tie your money up for a fixed period, these deposit accounts are best for a financial goal in the future such as saving up for a housing down payment. On the other hand, money market accounts can be a good place to store cash you need immediately like for an emergency fund. Checking accounts are typically used for everyday expenses like your credit card bill or rent payments. These accounts offer low variable interest rates as they’re not meant for long-term saving. You may be able to access your cash with an ATM or debit card, checks, and electronic transfer. If you’re seeking a higher APY, a money market account offers higher interest rates than checking accounts. Customers, however, may be limited in the number of withdrawals they can make from their money market account. MMAs and MMMFs both have the goal of earning you interest, but they’re two different vehicles to do so. The former is a savings account offered by a credit union or bank while the other is an investment account offered by a financial institution. For this reason, an MMA is FDIC-insured up to $250,000, while the MMMF isn’t FDIC-insured and could lose money. MMAs typically have restrictions on the number of transactions you can conduct per month, although they usually come with check writing and debit card capabilities. Meanwhile, MMMFs don’t allow check writing or debit card transactions, although you can often redeem your shares at any time. Your money is safe in a money market account if your bank or credit union is insured by theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation(FDIC) orNational Credit Union Administration(NCUA), respectively. These organizations insure your deposits of up to $250,000 per depositor, per account, per ownership category in the unlikely event ofbank failure.

Money market accounts offer variable interest rates tied to the federal funds rate, or the interest rate set by the Federal Reserve. This means that the APY you receive on your account varies based on Fed policy. Money market accounts are considered deposit accounts, so they’re riskless as long as your bank or credit union has FDIC or NCUA insurance, which provides up to $250,000 of coverage. Many money market accounts offer check-writing privileges, although some financial institutions may charge an additional fee for ordering checks. Many money market accounts offer debit cards, but not all do. Check with your financial institution to confirm that your MMA has a debit card. No. Money market accounts are deposit accounts offered by your bank or credit union that are liquid and federally insured. Money market funds are a type of mutual fund that invests in debt securities and may pay a small amount of interest on a monthly basis. These funds are not federally insured. Any interest earned on your money market account balance is considered taxable income and is reported to the IRS on Form 1099-INT. Your individual bank or credit union determines money market account APYs and may fluctuate in response to macroeconomic changes, changes to the federal funds rate, and more.

        "title": "These ants are saving our forests—by spraying acid everywhere",
        "source": "https://nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "The engineering and defensive skills of red wood ants help the endangered species transcend its small stature in the natural world. Wildlife photographerIngo Arndt discovered his first enormous ant mound as a child exploring the forest with his father near their home in Germany almost 50 years ago. They were bird-watching and came around a bend in a densely wooded area when there it was: a five-foot-tall mound, jutting upward like a large stalagmite. The mound was covered with a thick layer of spruce needles and throngs of tiny redants. Arndt wanted to investigate more closely, but a very particular smell suggested he rethink that impulse. The air felt thick and pungent, stinging his nostrils like vinegar. “All my life,” he says, “I could remember the smell.” (This photo was included among the best wildlife photos of 2024.) As an adult, Arndt has spent much of his career traveling to photograph animals like the pumas of Patagonia and kangaroos in Australia. Several years ago, he moved to the German countryside with his wife. While hiking through the region’s pine forests, the surroundings rekindled his fascination with the mounds and their armies of ultrasmall engineers. How did insects roughly a quarter of an inch long build such huge structures? And why did they emanate that astringent odor? (These ants are the first known animals to use moonlight to find their way home.) Arndt now had the tools and experience to seek answers to his questions. Outfitted with a high-resolution camera and macro lenses that allow you to focus on small objects up close, he began photographing the mounds and sharing his imagery with researchers for a scientific perspective. It turned out the mound makers were indeed special. They were red wood ants—scientifically classified as a group within the genusFormica—one of the smallest of all so-called keystone species. Among conservationists, keystone species such as elephants and sharks are watched closely because their behaviors affect so many aspects of their ecosystem that if they disappeared, it would struggle to adapt. Red wood ants are typically found in Eurasia’s temperate and boreal forests. But in recent decades, more nests have been disappearing as the forests have fallen victim to logging, urbanization, and wildfires, as well as drought and higher temperatures that have become more frequent with climate change. This has led several countries across the ants’ range, including Germany, to designate them as a protected species by law. Today Arndt’s photo quest has taken on new meaning. His images, which he’s been producing for the past two years, put on display these creatures’ fascinating ability to forge a multitude of symbiotic relationships across a variety of plant and animal species. In doing so, he’s revealed the wonders of a hidden insect world. The massive NESTS consist of two parts, one aboveground and one below, which red wood ants create by both burrowing into the earth and gathering needles, leaves, bark, and twigs. As they rise, each mound gains new entrances and corridors, supporting anywhere from 30,000 to upwards of 16 million insects, the largest aboveground nests of any ant species in the world. To learn more about this concealed society, Arndt enlisted the help of entomologist Bernhard Seifert, of the Senckenberg Natural History Museum’s research institute in Frankfurt, and zoologist Jürgen Tautz, professor emeritus at the Julius Maximilian University of Würzburg. The researchers helped explain how Arndt’s images showed the ants directing life within the forest in surprising ways. (These ants perform life-saving amputations on each other.) For instance, the ants generate formic acid in a venom gland at the rear of their abdomen. As they build a nest, the insects will gather tree resin, which has been shown to possess antimicrobial properties, and spray it with their acid, which has its own antimicrobial properties. The result is a more potent agent that the ants place throughout the structure to fight against bacterial and fungal pathogens. Formic acid also powers the species’ pest-control role. The fluid can be weaponized to take down other insects, like wood-boring beetles, one of the most destructive vermin in spruce forests. The fighting tactic, Seifert explains, involves “biting them and then spraying formic acid into the wounds.” Reducing the number of beetles that weaken and destroy trees improves conditions for aphids living in them. The ants “milk” the aphids to excrete honeydew, which becomes their primary food source. (Ants make ‘milk’? This new discovery took scientists by surprise.) Using camera traps, Arndt also captured larger animals lining up to get sprayed voluntarily. A rare image shows a Eurasian jay landing on top of a mound and calmly flattening out its tail to allow the ants to crawl up and attack. “The ants spray the jays as an enemy,” says Tautz. While the birds appear unharmed, the toxin is powerful enough to disperse or kill parasites, such as mites and lice, that they carry. For many bird species, this behavior helps them stay healthy too. Some uninvited guests that are willing to reek alongside the community have gained more benefits. As social insects, ants organize colonies and form complex societies, but they also cohabitate with a wide variety of species, including mites, spiders, and flies, within their nests. One trick is that some of these interlopers may have grown up already doused in a familiar scent. If a leaf beetle drops its eggs on or near the mound, the workers may inadvertently bring the eggs into the nest while collecting materials. “The larvae actually live inside it,” Arndt explains. The eggs, then the larvae, and eventually the pupae all smell like the nest. That’s how they elude their hosts’ detection and exploit the shelter to survive. In one study, researchers confirmed that, on average, more than a dozen different species can be found within a single mound. Arndt’s project highlights the strange and amazing ways these often overlooked creatures are influencing the action around them. While he did his best to avoid disrupting the protected species, the ants at times had other ideas and they’d hitch a ride back with him. “I’ll be out at dinner, and they show up and walk over my pants,” he says, laughing at the memory. “But I always try and bring everybody back to the nest.” The forest needs their collective power.

Armani closed four days of menswear previews for Fall-Winter 2025-26 at his historic headquarters on Via Borgonuovo, freeing the fashion crowd to head to Paris for the next round. Fans gathered behind barricades to snap photos of VIPs including Adrien Brodie, Joe Alwyn, Rocco Ritchie and Darren Star, arriving for the show under a light drizzle. Armani set the runway show deep inside the headquarters to a rhythmic almost club beat. Brimmed hats gave structure to the soft silhouette of wintery velvet and corduroy complemented by shimmering textiles that grabbed the light. Trousers were pleated, gathering slightly at the ankle, creating movement and allowing an easy tuck into laced boots. Jackets layered over zipped vests. Scarfs substituted for ties, sometimes big knits that converted to hoods. Faux fur collars, a trend in Milan this season, were used sparingly on outerwear. Jewel tones of ruby, emerald and sapphire brightened a neutral palette. Delicate crystal pins decorated evening wear lapels. A handful of women’s looks emphasized the versatility of the menswear silhouette. The show closed with couples dressed for a festive evening, glistening with sequins and crystals for him and for her. Armani took a final bow wearing a blue velvet jacket, underlining his hallmark of comfort and elegance. Brimmed hats. Textiles that shimmer. Unstructured bags. Sporty zip vests for suits. Scarves with built in turtlenecks. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

        "title": "A solid electrolyte gives lithium-sulfur batteries ludicrous endurance",
        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "Sulfur can store a lot more lithium but is problematically reactive in batteries. Lithium may be the key component in most modern batteries, but it doesn't make up the bulk of the material used in them. Instead, much of the material is in the electrodes, where the lithium gets stored when the battery isn't charging or discharging. So one way to make lighter and more compact lithium-ion batteries is to find electrode materials that can store more lithium. That's one of the reasons that recent generations of batteries are starting to incorporate silicon into the electrode materials. There are materials that can store even more lithium than silicon; a notable example is sulfur. But sulfur has a tendency to react with itself, producing ions that can float off into the electrolyte. Plus, like any electrode material, it tends to expand in proportion to the amount of lithium that gets stored, which can create physical strains on the battery's structure. So while it has been easy to make lithium-sulfur batteries, their performance has tended to degrade rapidly. But this week, researchers described a lithium-sulfur battery that still has over 80 percent of its original capacity after 25,000 charge/discharge cycles. All it took was a solid electrolyte that was more reactive than the sulfur itself. Sulfur is an attractive battery material. It's abundant and cheap, and sulfur atoms are relatively lightweight compared to many of the other materials used in battery electrodes. Sodium-sulfur batteries, which rely on two very cheap raw materials, have already been developed, although they only work at temperatures high enough to melt both of these components. Lithium-sulfur batteries, by contrast, could operate more or less the same way that current lithium-ion batteries do. With a few major exceptions, that is. One is that the elemental sulfur used as an electrode is a very poor conductor of electricity, so it has to be dispersed within a mesh of conductive material. (You can contrast that with graphite, which both stores lithium and conducts electricity relatively well, thanks to being composed of countless sheets of graphene.) Lithium is stored there as Li2S, which occupies substantially more space than the elemental sulfur it's replacing. Both of these issues, however, can be solved with careful engineering of the battery's structure. A more severe problem comes from the properties of the lithium-sulfur reactions that occur at the electrode. Elemental sulfur exists as aneight-atom ring, and the reactions with lithium are slow enough that semi-stable intermediates with smaller chains of sulfur end up forming. Unfortunately, these tend to be soluble in most electrolytes, allowing them to travel to the opposite electrode and participate in chemical reactions there. This process essentially discharges the battery without allowing the electrons to be put to use. And it gradually leaves the electrode's sulfur unavailable for participating in future charge/discharge cycles. The net result is that early generations of the technology would discharge themselves while sitting unused and would only survive a few hundred cycles before performance decayed dramatically. But there has been progress on all these fronts, and some lithium-sulfur batteries with performance similar to lithium-ion have been demonstrated. Late last year, a company announced that it had lined up the money needed to build the first large-scale lithium-sulfur battery factory. Still, work on improvements has continued, and the new work seems to suggest ways to boost performance well beyond lithium-ion. The paper describing the new developments, done by a collaboration between Chinese and German researchers, focuses on one aspect of the challenges posed by lithium-sulfur batteries: the relatively slow chemical reaction between lithium ions and elemental sulfur. It presents that aspect as a roadblock to fast charging, something that will be an issue for automotive applications. But at the same time, finding a way to limit the formation of inactive intermediate products during this reaction goes to the root of the relatively short usable life span of lithium-sulfur batteries. As it turns out, the researchers found two. One of the problems with the lithium-sulfur reaction intermediates is that they dissolve in most electrolytes. But that's not a problem if the electrolyte isn't a liquid. Solid electrolytes are materials that have a porous structure at the atomic level, with the environment inside the pores being favorable for ions. This allows ions to diffuse through the solid. If there's a way to trap ions on one side of the electrolyte, such as a chemical reaction that traps or de-ionizes them, then it can enable one-way travel. Critically, pores that favor the transit of lithium ions, which are quite compact, aren't likely to allow the transit of the large ionized chains of sulfur. So a solid electrolyte should help cut down on the problems faced by lithium-sulfur batteries. But it won't necessarily help with fast charging. The researchers began by testing a glass formed from a mixture of boron, sulfur, and lithium (B2S3and Li2S). But this glass had terrible conductivity, so they started experimenting with related glasses and settled on a combination that substituted in some phosphorus and iodine. The iodine turned out to be a critical component. While the exchange of electrons with sulfur is relatively slow, iodine undergoes electron exchange (technically termed a redox reaction) extremely quickly. So it can act as an intermediate in the transfer of electrons to sulfur, speeding up the reactions that occur at the electrode. In addition, iodine has relatively low melting and boiling points, and the researchers suggest there's some evidence that it moves around within the electrolyte, allowing it to act as an electron shuttle. The result is a far superior electrolyte—and one that enables fast charging. It's typical that fast charging cuts into the total capacity that can be stored in a battery. But when charged at an extraordinarily fast rate (50C, meaning a full charge in just over a minute), a battery based on this system still had half the capacity of a battery charged 25 times more slowly (2C, or a half-hour to full charge). But the striking thing was how durable the resulting battery was. Even at an intermediate charging rate (5C), it still had over 80 percent of its initial capacity after over 25,000 charge/discharge cycles. By contrast, lithium-ion batteries tend to hit that level of decay after about 1,000 cycles. If that sort of performance is possible in a mass-produced battery, it's only a slight exaggeration to say it can radically alter our relationships with many battery-powered devices. What's not at all clear, however, is whether this takes full advantage of one of the original promises of lithium-sulfur batteries: more charge in a given weight and volume. The researchers specify the battery being used for testing; one electrode is an indium/lithium metal foil, and the other is a mix of carbon, sulfur, and the glass electrolyte. A layer of the electrolyte sits between them. But when giving numbers for the storage capacity per weight, only the weight of the sulfur is mentioned. Still, even if weight issues would preclude this from being stuffed into a car or cell phone, there are plenty of storage applications that would benefit from something that doesn't wear out even with 65 years of daily cycling.

        "source": "https://mashable.com/",
        "content": "A new leak has seemingly revealed the hotly anticipated Samsung Galaxy S25 will see a major Galaxy AI upgrade. Thenew leakcomes from veteran smartphone leaker Evan Blass, who published what seems to be a marketing video showing off some of the new features coming to Samsung’s Galaxy AI suite of features. These features are expected to launch alongside theSamsung Galaxy S25 series, which will  likely be unveiled at Samsung’s latestGalaxy Unpacked event,  set to take place on Wednesday, January 22. The leaked video starts with a user being woken up by the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra’s alarm, after which a feature called Insights delivers information like the weather, sleep scores, and other data that the user might want to see when they first wake – all in a single scrollable screen. The video then cuts to another user who asks Google’s Gemini assistant to “find a pet-friendly Italian restaurant with outdoor seating and send it to Tony.” Gemini sends a rundown of nearby restaurants, then compiles a message that the user approves to be sent with a simple tap. Perhaps the best AI features are those that aren't as in-your-face, though. In the video, Samsung shows off the new Night Video mode on the Galaxy S25 series, which can seemingly capture more detail than before. It's kind of like how night mode photos have worked in the past, but in video. The user then makes use of the Audio Eraser tool to remove nearby noise, and focus the audio on a person playing piano. Not all of these features are completely new. For example, Gemini can already send text messages, and Google's Audio Eraser tool has been available on the Pixel since the launch of the Pixel 9 series. That said, Audio Eraser has so far been limited to Pixel devices, so the video at least shows off the fact that it's expanding to more phones. As mentioned, the likely reveal of the Galaxy S25 is only a few days away. It's expected to comprise the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra. All three new devices are expected get a series of upgrades apart from those that are AI-based, including the new Snapdragon 8 Elite chip. TopicsSamsungSamsung Unpacked"

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig)               Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills will take on Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC championship game for their fourth playoff matchup in five years. Allen ran for two touchdowns and the Bills beat Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens 27-25 in a divisional game on Sunday. Mark Andrews dropped a pass from Jackson on a 2-point conversion that would’ve tied it with 1:33 remaining and Buffalo held on for the victory. The Chiefs have defeated the Bills three straight times in the playoffs, including the conference title game four years ago in Kansas City. But Buffalo was the only team to beat Kansas City’s starters this season, a 30-21 victory at home in Week 11. It’ll be Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley and the Philadelphia Eagles hosting Jayden Daniels and the Washington Commanders in the NFC championship game. The Eagles advanced with a 28-22 victory over the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday. They’ll be home next week because the sixth-seeded Commanders upset the No. 1 seed Detroit Lions45-31on Saturday night. Barkley ran for 205 yards, including touchdown runs of 62 and 78 yards and Philadelphia’s defense held on the final drive with Jalen Carter sacking Matthew Stafford for a 9-yard loss to the 22. Stafford then fired an incomplete pass on fourth-and-11. The NFC East rival Eagles and Commanders will meet for the third time this season with each team winning at home. The Eagles beat Washington 26-18 in a Thursday night game on Nov. 14. The Commanders rallied for a 36-33 victory on Dec. 22 in a game where Hurts sustained a concussion in the first quarter.  Backup quarterback Kenny Pickett had Philadelphia in position to win that game, but DeVonta Smith dropped a third-down pass that would’ve allowed the Eagles to run out the clock. Instead, Jake Elliott kicked a field goal for a 33-28 lead and Daniels led another impressive comeback in the final two minutes, tossing a 9-yard TD pass to Jamison Crowder with 6 seconds remaining. The Eagles (16-3) are going to the NFC title game for the second time in three years and ninth time in franchise history. They’re 4-4 and won the Super Bowl once. The Commanders (14-5) are in the conference championship game for the first time in 33 years and seventh time in franchise history. Washington is 5-1 in the NFC title game and has won three Super Bowls. Rookie QBs are 0-5 in conference championship games, so Daniels will try to break that streak. The Chiefs (16-2) advanced on Saturday with a 23-14 victory over the Houston Texans. Mahomes threw for 177 yards and a touchdown to Travis Kelce, who had seven catches for 117 yards withgirlfriend Taylor Swiftwatching alongside WNBA star Caitlin Clark from a suite. It’ll be the seventh straight AFC championship game for Mahomes, Andy Reid and the Chiefs. They’ve gone 4-2 and have won three Super Bowls, including two in a row. Kansas City is aiming to become the first team in NFL history to three-peat in the Super Bowl era. The Bills (15-4) are 4-2 in AFC title games, but 0-4 in the Super Bowl, losing four in a row from the 1990-93 seasons. AP NFL:https://apnews.com/hub/nfl Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

        "content": "Chair: Complaints \"seek to weaponize the licensing authority of the FCC.\" Taking action in the final days of the Biden administration, the Federal Communications Commission dismissed three complaints and a petition filed against broadcast television stations. FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcelsaidthe action is important because \"the incoming President has called on the Federal Communications Commission to revoke licenses for broadcast television stations because he disagrees with their content and coverage.\" \"Today, I have directed the FCC to take a stand on behalf of the First Amendment,\" she said. \"We draw a bright line at a moment when clarity about government interference with the free press is needed more than ever. The action we take makes clear two things. First, the FCC should not be the president's speech police. Second, the FCC should not be journalism's censor-in-chief.\" President-elect Donald Trump's chosen replacement for Rosenworcel, Commissioner Brendan Carr, wants the FCC topunish news broadcastersthat he perceives as being unfair to Trump or Republicans in general. Backing Trump's various complaints about news stations, Carr has threatened to revoke licenses by wielding the FCC's authority to ensure that broadcasters using public airwaves operate in the public interest. Rosenworcel said the complaints and petition she is dismissing \"come from all corners—right and left—but what they have in common is they ask the FCC to penalize broadcast television stations because they dislike station behavior, content, or coverage.\" After Trump criticized CBS in October, Rosenworcelsaidthe agency \"does not and will not revoke licenses for broadcast stations simply because a political candidate disagrees with or dislikes content or coverage.\" The Center for American Rights filed complaints supporting Trump's claims of bias regardingABC's fact-checkingduring a presidential debate, theediting of a CBS60 Minutesinterviewwith Kamala Harris, and NBCputting Harris on aSaturday Night Liveepisode. Separately, the Media and Democracy Project filed apetition to denya license renewal for WTXF-TV in Philadelphia, a station owned and operated by Fox, alleging that Fox willfully distorted news with false reports of fraud in the 2020 election that Trump lost. Rejecting all four, Rosenworcel said \"the facts and legal circumstances in each of these cases are different. But what they share is that they seek to weaponize the licensing authority of the FCC in a way that is fundamentally at odds with the First Amendment. To do so would set a dangerous precedent. That is why we reject it here.\" Dismissing complaints isn't likely to end the cases, said Jeffrey Westling, a lawyer at the conservative American Action Forum who hasurgedCongress to \"limit or revoke the FCC's authority to impose content-based restrictions on broadcast television.\" Westlingsaidhe agrees \"substantively\" with Rosenworcel, but added that \"the DC Circuit Court has made clear that the FCC has to consider news distortion complaints (seeSerafyn vs FCC) and not just dismiss them outright. If I am the complainants, I challenge these dismissals in court, win, and get more attention.\" When contacted by Ars today, the Center for American Rights provided a statement criticizing Rosenworcel's decision as \"political and self-serving.\" \"We fundamentally believe that several actions taken by the three major networks were partisan, dishonest and designed to support Vice President Harris in her bid to become President,\" the group said. \"We will continue to pursue avenues to ensure the American public is protected from media manipulation of our Republic. The First Amendment does not protect intentional misrepresentation or fraud.\" The group previouslytouted the factthat Republican FCC Commissioner Nathan Simington urged FCC leadership to take its complaints seriously. TheMedia and Democracy Projectcriticized Rosenworcel's decision to dismiss its complaint against the Fox station in Philadelphia. \"We look forward to presenting on appeal the multiple court decisions that raise serious questions about the Murdochs' and Fox's character qualifications to remain broadcast licensees,\" the Media and Democracy Project said in a statement provided to Ars. \"As renowned First Amendment scholar Floyd Abrams stated in hisfilingwith the Commission, the First Amendment is no bar to Commission action given the facts of this case. Our petition is clearly distinct from the other politically motivated complaints.\" The group's petition pointed to acourt rulingthat found Fox News aired false statements about Dominion Voting Systems. Fox later agreed topay Dominion $788 millionto settle a defamation lawsuit. \"Our Petition to Deny is based on judicial findings that Fox made repeated false statements that undermined the electoral process and resulted in property damage, injury, and death; that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch engaged in a 'carefully crafted scheme' in 'bad faith' to deprive Lachlan's siblings of the control to which they are entitled under an irrevocable trust; and that 'Murdoch knowingly caused the corporation to violate the law,'\" the Media and Democracy Project said today. The FCCorderdenying the petition also granted the station's application for a license renewal. The order said the allegations regarding \"material carried on a cable network under common control with the Licensee that a state court found to be false\" aren't grounds to deny the individual station's license renewal. While some \"non-FCC-related misconduct\" can be considered by the FCC in an evaluation of a licensee's character, the finding in the defamation suit doesn't qualify, the order said. Gigi Sohn, a longtime advocate whose nomination to the FCC wasrejected by the Senate, also criticized the FCC today. Sohn, who also served as counselor for FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler during the Obama administration,calledthe dismissal of the Fox petition a \"failure to lead.\" \"As [Rosenworcel] herself points out, the facts of these petitions are very different,\" Sohn wrote. \"The [Media and Democracy Project] petition seeks a hearing on Fox Philadelphia licenses because they allege that Fox lacks the character to hold them because it lied to the American people about the 2020 election. The conservative complaints are all based on disagreements with editorial judgments of the various broadcast networks.\" \"The decision to lump these filings together and overturn years of FCC precedent that broadcasters' character is central to holding a license is contrary to the Communications Act's mandate that licenses be granted in 'the public interest, convenience and necessity,'\" Sohn also wrote. The FCC rationale would mean that \"anything and everything a broadcast licensee does or says would be a First Amendment issue that warrants automatic license renewal,\" she added. Media advocacy group Free Press agreed with the FCC's decision. \"We have an incoming administration quite literally threatening to jail journalists for doing their jobs, and an incoming FCC chairman talking about revoking broadcast licenses any time he disagrees with their political coverage,\" the groupsaid. Free Press sided with the FCC despite noting that the Fox case involved \"false information [that] had devastating consequences in the January 6 attack on the peaceful transition of power four years ago.\" \"Lies knowingly aired by Fox News Channel and some Murdoch-owned Fox affiliates present a significantly different challenge to regulators than merely fact-checking, editing or scheduling equal time for candidates in ways that displease the president-elect,\" Free Press said. \"Yet we agree with the urgent need to prevent the weaponization of the government against journalists and media companies on the eve of the inauguration, and in light of the dire threats the new administration poses.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "An incoming White House official confirmed the executive action on Monday. Incoming PresidentDonald Trumpis expected to issue an executive order that would systematically dismantle all diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives within the federal government, an incoming Trump White House official told reporters during a press call on Monday. The order, which Trump is expected to sign on Monday, his first day in office, will direct the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management to coordinate with agencies to terminate all DEI programs in federal agencies, including environmental justice programs, equity related grants, equity action plans and equity initiatives, the official said. The actions will create “equal treatment” and end DEI in the federal government, the official added. While the executive action does not address DEI policies within private companies, when asked, the Trump official indicated that actions regarding private companies could be coming. \"Private business should wait and see. We have more actions on DEI very soon,\" the official said. The executive order would rescind DEI policies instituted by the Biden administration – some of which were implemented to combat policies against DEI that Trump, implemented during his first term as president. Trump, who has been outspoken against DEI initiatives, denied the existence of systemic racism in a September 2020executive action, which restricted diversity training within the federal government, its contractors and grant recipients. “This ideology is rooted in the pernicious and false belief that America is an irredeemably racist and sexist country,” the executive order said, adding that DEI training “perpetuates racial stereotypes and division and can use subtle coercive pressure to ensure conformity of viewpoint.” Outgoing PresidentJoe Bidensignaled his support for DEI initiatives on his first day in office, signing anexecutive orderthat “emphasized the enormous human costs of systemic racism, persistent poverty, and other disparities,” and “directed the federal government to advance an ambitious, whole-of-government equity agenda that matches the scale of the challenges we face as a country and the opportunities we have to build a more perfect union.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(AP Photo/George Walker IV)       ▶Follow live updates onPresident-elect Donald Trump’s return to Washington NEW YORK (AP) — During his first term as president,Donald Trumpled the effort to ban TikTok, the hugely popular video-sharing site he said posed a threat to U.S. national security. But on the eve of his return to the White House, the president-elect is being hailed as the app’s savior. After going dark for users this weekend, Trump said on his social media site that he would issue an executive order after he’s sworn in for a second term on Monday delaying a TikTok ban “so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.” He said the order would make clear that companies will not be held liable for violating a law that aimed to force TikTok’s sale by its China-based parent company. Hours later, the app returned, to the relief of its legions of dedicated users. “Thanks for your patience and support. As a result of President Trump’s efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.!” read the announcement. Trump’s legal authority to unilaterally decide not to enforce the law, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in April andwas upheld by the Supreme Courton Friday, is unclear. But the rapid developments over the weekend served as a reminder of how dramatically debates over technology, social media and national security have changed since Trump was last in the White House. It also signaled how closely Trump is following those shifts after waging a successful campaign in which he made inroads with voters in part by harnessing the appeal of some social media platforms. Trump can now take credit for reviving an app with 170 million users that is especially popular with younger Americans, many of whom spend hours a day on the platform to get news, make money and find entertainment.  “This is one of those things where the domestic politics has become so upside down and crazy that it turns out there’s only upside for Trump now,” said Bill Bishop, a China expert who has been closely following the back-and-forth. If the ban ends up being enforced, he said, Trump will say it was on outgoing President Joe Biden’s watch. “And if it does come back then Trump is a savior. And he will be rewarded both by users” as well as the company, which he said is now “beholden to Trump” and will have an incentive to make sure content on the platform is favorable to him. TikTok’s move comes as tech companies and CEOs have been been working furiously toimprove their standing with Trump. X owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has enjoyed unprecedented access to the president-elect after spending more than $200 million and personally campaigning to help him get elected. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and reshaped his social media platforms’ policies to align more closely with Trump’s worldview earlier this month,ending third-party fact-checking, loosening rules against hate speech, ending his company’s diversity and equity policies and naming Dana White, the president and CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship and afamiliar figurein Trump’s orbit, to its board. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Amazon, Meta and Google have all pledged to donate $1 million each to Trump’s inaugural fund. The companies have a lot on the line, including regulatory challenges. Although federal regulators began cracking down on Google and Facebook during Trump’s first term as president — and flourished under Biden — most experts expect his second administration toease up on antitrust enforcementand be more receptive to business mergers. TikTok also worked to curry Trump’s favor, with CEO Shou Chew meeting with him at Mar-a-Lago in December and later present in Washington over the weekend for Trump’s inauguration. In avideo responding to the Supreme Court decision, Chew was careful to praise Trump and cast the app’s fate as dependent on him. “On behalf of everyone at TikTok and all our users across the country, I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States,” he said. “We are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform.” When the app went dark, it had initially posted a simple message informing users of the change, but later updated the language to include Trump. “Sorry, TikTok isn’t available right now,” it read. “A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!” The federal law had required TikTok parent company ByteDance to cut ties with the platform’s U.S. operations by Sunday. The Biden administration had stressed in recent days that it did not intend to enforce the ban before Trump took office. But TikTok said it would nonetheless “go dark” because the Biden administrationhad not provided “necessary clarity and assurance”to service providers — a stance outgoing Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer cast as disingenuous. “Frankly, it doesn’t feel completely on the level,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.” “I think we were extremely clear that there was no need to take this action,” he said. Trump said inan interview with NBC Newson Saturday that he was considering granting ByteDance a 90-day extension to sell. ByteDance has repeatedly refused to sell, but the company is being eyed by investors including Trump’sformer Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchinand billionaire businessmanFrank McCourt. Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University’s Tech Policy Institute, said there was no evidence ByteDance had made any meaningful progress toward divestiture, “so I don’t see how, by any measure, it would legally meet those conditions.” “Further, an Executive Order cannot legally override or cancel a law that Congress passed,” she said. “Laws enacted through the legislative process have a higher legal standing and an EO that conflicts with the existing law, the law takes precedence and the EO would likely be struck down by the courts.” Sen. Tom Cotton, the Republican chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, warned Sunday that there is no legal basis for the kind of extension Trump is pursuing. “Any company that hosts, distributes, services, or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok could face hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law, not just from DOJ, but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state AGs,”he wrote on X. “Think about it.” Trump, in his Sunday post, proposed new terms of a deal in which he said the United States would have “a 50% ownership position in a joint venture” that would be “set up between the U.S. and whichever purchase we so choose.” But the details remained murky and it was unclear whether Trump was proposing control by the U.S. government or another company. Trump did not elaborate during a rally Sunday night, where he hailed the move. “As of today, TikTok is back,” he said. “We have no choice. We have to save it.” Though Trump sought to ban TikTok during his first term, he reversed that stance during his 2024 campaign, when he came to believe a ban would help the app’s rival, Facebook, which he held responsible, in part, to his 2020 election loss to Biden. Trump ended upjoining the app last yearand has grown his following to nearly 15 million users. He has since credited the app for helping him win over young voters. “I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” he said during a December news conference. “TikTok had an impact.” Ortutay reported from Oakland, California.

There is renewed talk of a coal power comeback in the United States, inspired by Donald Trump’s return to the presidency and forecasts of soaring electricity demand. The evidence so far only shows that some plants are getting small extensions on their retirement dates. This means a slowdown in coal’s rate of decline, which is bad for the environment, but it does little to change the long-term trajectory for the domestic coal industry. In October, I wrote about how five of the country’s 10 largest coal-fired power plantshad retirement dates. Today, I’m revisiting the list, providing some updates and then taking a few steps back to look at US coal plants as a whole. Consider this the “before” picture that can be judged against the “after” in four years. Some coal plant owners have already pushed back retirement timetables. The largest example, this one from just before the election, is the Gibson plant in Indiana, the second-largest coal plant in the country. It’sset to close in 2038 instead of 2035, following an announcement in October from the owner, Duke Energy. But the changes do not constitute a coal comeback in this country. For that to happen, power companies would need to be building new plants to replace the many that are closing, and there is almost no development of new coal plants. That said, there have been some changes since October. As recently as a few months ago, Southern Co. was saying it intended to close Plant Bowen in Georgia by 2035 at the latest. Bowen is the largest coal plant in the country, with a summer capacity of 3,200 megawatts. Southern has since said it may extend the plant’s life in response to forecasts of rising electricity demand. Chris Womack, Southern’s CEO, confirmed this possibility when speaking at a utility industry conference in November, saying thatthe plant may need to operate for longer than previously plannedbecause of demand from data centers. Southern has not yet made regulatory filings that spell out its plans, but this will likely occur in the next few weeks, according to a company spokesman. In October, I reported that the Gavin plant in Ohio was likely to get a 2031 date to retire or switch to a different fuel once the plant’s pending sale was completed. The person who shared that information with me was involved with the plans and spoke on condition of anonymity because the sale was not final. Since then, the prospective buyer of the plant has said in federal regulatory filings that it has no timetable for closing the plant or switching to a different fuel. The plant is changing hands as part of a larger deal between investment firms, with Lightstone Holdco selling to Energy Capital Partners, or ECP. Another company, coal exporter Javelin Global Commodities, is buying a minority share of the Gavin plant. I went back to the person who told me about the 2031 retirement date. They said forecasts of rising electricity demand, as well as the election of Trump, have created enough uncertainty about power prices and regulations that it makes sense to not specify a date. The 2031 timeline, and its abandonment, makes some sense once you understand that the Biden administration finalized power plant regulations last spring that gave coal plant operators an incentive to announce a retirement date: Plants closing before 2032 faced no new requirements. That incentive is likely to go away as Trump plans to roll back power plant pollution regulations. Gavin’s sale is still pending. Several parties have filed objections to the transaction with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, arguing that the sellers have not been clear enough about their plans. An ECP spokesman said the company has no comment beyond its filings. Other than the changes to plans for Bowen and Gavin, the outlook has not shifted for the rest of the plants among the 10 largest. The Gibson and Rockport plants in Indiana still have retirement dates, as do Cumberland in Tennessee and Monroe in Michigan, according to the plants’ owners. The Amos plant in West Virginia, Miller in Alabama, Scherer in Georgia, and Parish in Texas didn’t have retirement dates a few months ago, and they still don’t. But the largest coal plants are only part of the story. Several dozen smaller plants are getting extensions of retirement plans, asEmma Foehringer Merchant reported last week for Floodlight News. One example is the 1,157-megawatt Baldwin plant in Illinois, which was scheduled to close this year. Now the owner, Vistra Corp.,has pushed back the retirement to 2027. A few extra years of a coal plant is more of a stopgap than a long-term solution. When it comes to building new power plants to meet demand, developers are talking about natural gas, solar, nuclear, and other resources, but I have yet to see a substantial discussion of building a new coal plant. In Alaska, Gov. Mike Dunleavy has saidthe state may build two coal plantsto provide power in remote mining areas, as reported by Taylor Kuykendall of S&P Global Commodity Insights. Flatlands Energy, a Canadian company, has also talked aboutbuilding a 400-megawatt coal plantin Alaska, as Nathaniel Herz reported for Alaska Beacon. These appear to be early-stage plans. The lack of development activity underscores how coal power is fading in this country, and has been for a while. Coal was used to generate 16 percent of US electricity in 2023, down by more than half from 2014. In that time, coal went from the country’s leading fuel for electricity to trailing natural gas, renewables, and nuclear. (These and all the figures that follow are from the US Energy Information Administration.) The United States had about 176,000 megawatts of coal plant capacity as of October, down from about 300,000 megawatts in 2014. The coal plants that do remain are being used less. In 2023, theaverage capacity factor for a coal plantwas 42 percent. Capacity factor is a measure of how much electricity a plant has generated relative to the maximum possible if it was running all the time. In 2014, the average capacity factor was 61 percent. Power companies are burning less coal because of the availability of less expensive alternatives, such as natural gas, wind, and solar, among others. The think tank Energy Innovation issued a report in 2023 finding that 99 percent of US coal-fired power plantscost more to operate than the cost of replacementwith a combination of wind, solar, and batteries. The Trump administration will arrive in Washington with promises to help fossil fuels. It could extend the lives of some coal plants by weakening environmental regulations, which may reduce the plants’ operational costs. It also could repeal or revise subsidies that help to reduce the costs of renewables and batteries, making those resources more expensive. I don’t want to minimize the damage that could be caused by those policies. But even in extreme scenarios, it’s difficult to imagine investors wanting to spend billions of dollars to develop a new coal plant, much less a fleet of them.

        "content": "Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Commuters sit on the F train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue Station, Thursday, Dec. 26, 2024, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) NEW YORK (AP) — It took police more than a week topublicly identifyDebrina Kawam, 57, as the woman who was fatallyset on firein a New York subway train last month. But on the internet, it took just hours for a false name to begin spreading. In posts that circulated widely on social media after Kawam’s death on Dec. 22, users claimed without evidence that the victim was a 29-year-old named “Amelia Carter.” These posts ricocheted across platforms, often accompanied by an image of a young woman that experts say may have been generated by artificial intelligence. It’s not clear who first made up the claim or why. But many sharing it highlighted the immigration status of the manchargedin Kawam’s death — federal immigration officials say he is a Guatemalan citizen whoentered the U.S. illegally— while accusing the media of refusing to name the “beautiful young white woman.” Nathan Walter, an associate professor at Northwestern University who studies misinformation, said the story was “manna from heaven” for anti-immigration narratives and that it became a “framing war” while the public sought information that was not yet available. “It spreads quickly because it just fits so well,” he said of misinformation about the victim’s identity. “And when something fits so well, we typically just tend to nod along and we don’t really question it.” Graphic footage of Kawam engulfed in flames spread widely online soon after the Dec. 22 attack, boosting curiosity about her identity. But while a suspect, Sebastian Zapeta, was arrested later that day, scant details were available about the victim in the following days as authorities worked to identify her through forensics and video surveillance.  Instead, users filled the void with false claims about “Amelia Carter.” Posts called for officials and the media to “say her name.” Some claimed she was on her way to visit her grandmother in Queens, despite the fact that the victim was set alight at the opposite end of the subway line in Brooklyn. Some posts compared it to the February 2024 killing of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley by a Venezuelan man in the country illegally, which became apolitical rallying pointfor Republicans during the presidential race in support of increased border security. As the falsehood spread, some began sharing a photo of a real Amelia Carter, who then had to post on X that she was “alive and well.” But the initial image that was shared in many of these posts had signs” of being created by a generative adversarial network — a type of AI that can be used for creating images of fake people that are difficult to distinguish from the real thing — said Hany Farid, a digital forensics and misinformation expert at the University of California, Berkeley. Farid pointed to the nondescript nature of the headshot and the alignment of the eyes as indications that the image may have been AI generated, though he acknowledged that its low quality made it difficult to analyze properly. In an age when many have come to expect immediate answers, Michelle Ciulla Lipkin, executive director of the National Association for Media Literacy Education, noted that many people have lost patience for “that uncomfortable moment where we don’t have all the information.” Bad actors often take advantage of this, she said, preying on the public’s desire to find out what’s going on and promote their own agendas. Authorities finally revealed the victim of the subway burning on Tuesday, saying Kawam was from New Jersey and had briefly been in a New York homeless shelter after moving to the city recently. Zapeta, whose address matches a shelter that provides housing and substance abuse support, has been indicted on murder and arson charges, according to prosecutors. He is yet to enter a plea, and his attorney has declined to comment. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "Joy-Cons are about 18% wider, with bigger buttons and joysticks too. Thursday'steaser trailer for the Switch 2made it abundantly clear that the upcoming console will be quite a bit larger than the original Switch that came before it. But Nintendo is still being coy about the specific dimensions of the Switch 2's expanded tablet and Joy-Cons. Fortunately, the trailer itself features a number of head-on shots of the Switch 2 hardware next to a known quantity—the original Switch Joy-Cons. Using the established measurements of that older controller (102×35.9 mm) and some Photoshop pixel counting, we can use freeze frames from that trailer to extrapolate a rough size and shape for the Switch 2 hardware. After spending a good chunk of Thursday performing just those calculations, we're ready to estimate that the Switch 2 hardware features a roughly 7.9-inch screen (measured diagonally), up from 6.2 inches on the Switch and 7 inches on the Switch OLED. We also learned that the Switch tablet itself has a roughly 33 percent larger footprint than that of the original Switch (in terms of total area), while the joysticks on the Switch 2 Joy-Cons have a roughly 26 percent larger diameter than those on the Switch. More detailed numbers for other dimensions of the Switch 2 and its Joy-Cons are included in the spreadsheet and images below (please click on any image to get more zoomed detail). But first, a bit more detail on how we figured out these estimates. After taking screenshots of relevant frames from the Switch 2 trailer, we measured the size of the Switch Joy-Cons in terms of pixels, both horizontally and vertically. We then measured the new hardware shown in those same frames in pixels and multiplied along each axis to estimate the dimensions of the Switch 2 tablet and screen, as well as the height and button/joystick size of the new Joy-Cons. Using those measurements, we were able to estimate the total width of the Joy-Cons (with the extended magnetic \"rail\") as seen in other frames from the trailer. This measurement method requires some judgment calls to decide where the edges of certain Switch 2 elements begin and end in the relevant frames. Issues of distortion associated with the camera lens (or video editing on Nintendo's part) might also affect the precision of the measurements. Still, the results of this calculation should be close enough for a first-order estimate. Overall, the Switch's expanded screen size would give it something of a leg up over portable PC competition like theSteam Deck(orSteam Deck OLED) andROG Ally X. To get a significantlybiggerscreen on a gaming handheld, you have to look tothe Lenovo Legion Goor monsters like the upcomingAcer Nitro Blaze 11. Yet despite the larger screen, the Switch 2 still comes in significantly narrower than competition like the Steam Deck (10.48-inch width with Joy-Cons for the Switch 2 versus 11.7 inches for the Steam Deck). As for the new Joy-Cons, a lengthening of roughly 13 to 18 percent along either axis should make holding them a little less cramp-inducing for adult hands. And the additional surface area on the joysticks (~43 percent larger) and buttons (~60 percent larger) should make them significantly more comfortable under the thumbs. We won't really know how the comparative hardware battle will shake out, though, until we get crucial details from Nintendo about things like the Switch 2's thickness, weight, screen resolution, and hardware power (not to mention the price, of course). For now, though, at least we can look at these images and measurements and imagine how the next Nintendo console will feel in our hands.

        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "Garvey was convicted of mail fraud in 1923. President Joe Biden has posthumously pardoned civil rights leader Marcus Garvey, who was convicted of mail fraud over 100 years ago. The outgoing president has used his power of clemency to grant more more individual pardons and commutations than any other president in U.S. history, according to a statement from Biden on Sunday. The president said that Garvey and the other clemency recipients \"made significant contributions to improving their communities.\" \"Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. described Mr. Garvey as 'the first man of color in the history of the United States to lead and develop a mass movement,'\" Biden said in a statement. \"Advocates and lawmakers praise his global advocacy and impact, and highlight the injustice underlying his criminal conviction.\" Rep. Yvette D. Clarke, D-N.Y., led a group of 21 House Democrats -- mostly from the Congressional Black Caucus --in signing a letter urging Bidento exonerate Garvey, according to a statement sent by the lawmakers to ABC News last month. Garvey, one of the earliest internationally-known Black civil rights leaders, was convicted of mail fraud in 1923 and was given a five-year sentence, according to a letter sent to Biden from the congressional members, obtained by ABC News. President Calvin Coolidge commuted Garvey's sentence after he served two years in prison. Garvey was immediately deported to his birth country of Jamaica. “As we approach our nation’s observance of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, I’m extraordinarily grateful for President Biden’s action today to posthumously grant clemency to a true national hero of Jamaica,\" Clarke said in a statement on Sunday. Congress members have tried for decades to clear Garvey's name, according to the current members who pushed for his exoneration. Former Rep. John Conyers of Michigan led hearings in 1987 for the House Judiciary Committee on Garvey's exoneration. Former Rep. Charles Rangel of New York introduced resolutions, highlighting alleged injustices against the former civil rights leader in 2004. \"Exactly 101 years ago, Mr. Garvey was convicted of mail fraud in a case that was marred by prosecutorial and governmental misconduct,\" the members of Congress said in the letter they sent to Biden last month. \"The evidence paints an abundantly clear narrative that the charges against Mr. Garvey were not only fabricated but also targeted to criminalize, discredit, and silence him as a civil rights leader.\" Garvey, who wasborn in Jamaica in 1887, was a notable Pan-Africanist, believing that people of African descent around the world should be unified because of their alleged common interests. He was the founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) which was created to challenge racial inequality, according to the lawmakers. The organization championed self-determination and economic independence for Black people at a time when Jim Crow laws oppressed African Americans and colonization subjugated Africans on their own continent. The civil rights leader also established the Black Star Line, one of the first Black-owned shipping companies in the Western Hemisphere, connecting Black businesses across the Americas, according to the lawmakers. Garvey eventually wanted to route the vessels to Africa for a redemption program, according tothe U.S. National Archives and Records Administration. He wanted to establish a nation for those who were born into slavery or were the descendants of enslaved people, according toThe Washington Post. He also created the Negro World Newspaper which, at its peak, reached a circulation of 200,000 readers weekly, according to the congress members. Garvey shared the segregationist views of the Ku Klux Klan as he sought a separate state for those of the African diaspora, according toThe Washington Post. \"I regard the Klan the Anglo Saxon clubs and white American societies as far as the Negro is concerned, as better friends of the race than all other groups of hypocritical whites put together,\" Garvey said, according toThe New York Times. Other Black civil rights activists were outraged. W. E. B. Du Bois said Garvey was the most dangerous enemy of the Negro race and was either \"a lunatic or a traitor,\" according toPBS. Du Bois also said Garvey \"suffered from serious defects of temperament and training.\" The newly formed Bureau of Investigation, later becoming the FBI, and the director of its intelligence division, a-youngJ. Edgar Hoover, brought mail fraud proceedings against Garvey in connection to the sale of Black Star Line shipping stock, according toThe Washington Post. He was sentenced to five years in prison and served two years before his pardon and eventual deportation by Coolidge. Garvey never returned to the U.S. again, according to theU.S. National Archives and Records Administration. The FBI declined ABC News' request for a comment. \"Although granting Mr. Garvey’s clemency will help remove the shadow of an unjust conviction and further the Biden Administration’s promise to advance racial justice, Mr. Garvey’s family, myself, and countless others across our nation and around the world will continue to push towards his full and unambiguous exoneration,\" Clarke said in a statement Sunday. Biden announced nearly2,500 pardonsfor non-violent drug offenders on Friday. ABC News' John Parkinson and Michelle Stoddart contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "content": "Cryptocurrency markets can be chaotic, but Trump (or teams connected to him) just took it to the next level. Days ahead of Trump's inauguration as President of the United States, scheduled for Monday, Jan. 20, Trump launched the $TRUMP memecoin on crypto platform Solana. The President-elect posted thenews from his official X account, making it as official as can be. This is not exactly news. Trump has endorsed cryptocoins andcrypto projectsbefore, though this one is nowbilled as the\"only Official Trump Meme.\" The difference, however, is that this new memecoin – which, by the way, doesn't do anything, it's just a coin named TRUMP – was launched just ahead Trump's inauguration, making it easy to interpret it as a sort of an endorsement of the Solana platform, memecoins in general, and the practice of unscrupulously capitalizing on attention by launching a quick pump-and-dump scheme. For an idea of how these things typically go, check the recentHAWK coin fiasco. As for the TRUMP coin, it quickly rose from basically zero to an astonishing $83, which multiplied by the number of coins (one billion) meant $TRUMP at one point had a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $83 billion. The enormous race to get into the $TRUMP coin caused an unprecedented liquidity drain on the rest of the market, with nearly all other cryptocurrency coins being sold off and losing value. As of this writing, $TRUMP sits at roughly $58, giving it a FDV of $58 billion. Some of the other crypto coins recovered in the meantime, with Bitcoin actually reaching an all-time-high price of $109,000 early on Monday, though numerous altcoins are still deeply in the red. This, however, apparently wasn't chaotic enough for Trump and his crypto army, who followed up by launching an official$MELANIA memecoinduring Trump's victory rally on Sunday. The launch resulted in yet another race to buy the coin, draining the liquidity from nearly everything on the market, including $TRUMP. So far, though, $MELANIA is doing well, with a price of $11.26, and a fully diluted valuation of $11.5 billion. Cryptocurrencies are known to be volatile, and coins often rise from basically nothing to millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars in valuation within days, but the meteoric rise of $TRUMP was nuts even by those standards. With inauguration ahead of us, things are probably about to get even crazier. TopicsCryptocurrencyDonald Trump Stan is a Senior Editor at Mashable, where he has worked since 2007.

Bickel, File)            WASHINGTON (AP) —Donald Trumpis holding off on tariffs during his first day and placing a big bet that hisexecutive actionscan cut energy prices and tame inflation. But it’s unclear whether his orders will be enough to move the U.S. economy as he promised. “The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending,” Trump said in his inaugural address as he suggested that increase oil production would lower prices. Orders coming Monday, including one tied to Alaska, are meant to ease the regulatory burdens on oil and natural gas production. He also intends to declare a national energy emergency in hopes of jumpstarting more electricity production in the competition with China to build out technologies such as artificial intelligence that rely ondata centersusing massive amounts of energy. Trump plans to sign a presidential memorandum seeking a broad-based government approach to bringing down inflation. All those details are according to an incoming White House official who insisted on anonymity while outlining Trump’s plans during a call with reporters. The official said the new administration, on his first day in office, will end what Trump incorrectly calls an electric car “mandate.” While there is no mandate from outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden to force the purchase of electric vehicles, his polices have sought to encourage Americans to buy EVs and auto companies to shift from gas-powered vehicles to electric cars. Trump, during his campaign and after he won the November election, threatened tariffs on China, Mexico, Canada and other countries. But he appears to be holding off so far on higher taxes on imports. The official pointed reporters to a Wall Street Journal story saying Trump will only sign a memorandum telling federal agencies to study trade issues.  Still, Trump pledged in his inaugural address that tariffs would be coming and said foreign countries would be paying the trade penalties, even though those taxes are currently paid by domestic importers and often passed along to consumers. The decision to pause and study tariffs was a sign that to the Canadian government that it should be prepared for almost all possibilities on the direction of trade with the United States. “Perhaps he’s made decisions to sort of suspend the threat of tariffs over a whole slate of countries. We will wait and see,” Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc said. “Mr. Trump has been in a previous mandate unpredictable so our job is to make sure we are ready for any scenario.” Overall, the Republican faces an array of challenges with fulfilling his ambitions to lower prices. Biden managed to see the inflation rate drop over two years yet he was leaving office with price growth still outpacing wages over the past four years. A big driver of inflation is a persistent housing shortage, and U.S. oil production is already at record levels, with producers facing uncertainty about global demand this year. The Federal Reserve is technically the government body tasked with keeping inflation at a roughly 2% annual target. Its usual levers are setting short-term rates for banks lending to each other, in addition to bond purchases and public communications. Trump has said natural resource production is key to lowering costs for American consumers, both at the pump and in their utility bills. Energy prices permeate every part of the economy, so increasing U.S. production of oil, natural gas and other fossil fuels is critical to national security. Trump, who has pledged to restore U.S. “energy dominance,” has complained that the Biden administration limited Alaska’s oil and gas production. Trump showed his relative indifference to the fossil fuels accelerating climate change, even as he lamented natural disasters such as the Los Angeles wildfires. He said he would again withdraw the United States from the landmark Paris climate agreement, dealing a blow to efforts to combat global warming and once again distancing the U.S. from its closest allies. Energy can impact prices, but it’s not the largest chunk of families’ spending. According to the weightings for the consumer price index, energy spending represents on average just 6% of expenditures, much less than food (13%) or shelter (37%). Inflation, dormant for decades, resurfaced in early 2021 as the economy recovered with unexpected strength from COVID-19 lockdowns. A surge in customer orders overwhelmed America’s supply chains, causing delays, shortages and higher prices. Factories for computer chips, furniture and other products worldwide struggled to rebound. Republican lawmakers were quick to blame the Biden administration’s $1.9 trillion pandemic relief, though inflation was a global phenomenon that points to factors beyond U.S. policy. Inflation further worsened after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, pushing up energy and food prices. In response, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Inflation has come down from a four-decade high 9.1% in mid-2022. But inflation has picked up since September to an annual rate of 2.9% in December. Voters were unimpressed with the progress against inflation, frustrated that prices remained more than 20% higher than they were four years ago while average weekly earnings had not kept up. Higher grocery prices – up 27% from February 2021 -- were especially painful. After the inaugural address, Trump played down the importance of inflation in the 2024 election, suggesting that his voters cared more about immigration because there was only so many ways to talk about prices. “How many times can you say that an apple has doubled in cost?” Trump said.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)       ATLANTA (AP) — Notre Dame football coach Marcus Freeman felt more comfortable talking about the national championship his players have a chance to win Monday night than the history attached to it if they pull it off. Still, it’s hard to ignore the connections between Freeman’s fate — he is trying to become thefirst African American coach to capture a college titleat the highest level in America’s favorite sport — and all that’s happening in the U.S. on the day of the big game. Monday, Jan. 20 is national-title day but also the day the United States celebrates Martin Luther King Jr., and inaugurates Donald Trump to his second term as president. King devoted his life to fighting for inclusion and equality, and today diversity initiatives are increasingly under scrutiny on college campuses. “The timing of Marcus Freeman and Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a powerful symbol that should be viewed with cautious optimism,” said Joseph Cooper, the director of the Institute for Innovative Leadership in Sport at UMass. “And with the incoming administration and their professed commitment to undo DEI policies, it reflects the peril and the long journey we still have to go, beyond just breaking barriers with pioneers.” That Freeman’s potential breakthrough comes more than 40 years after a Black basketball coach first did the same, and that it comes against a backdrop of a mediocre minority hiring record that has shadowed college sports for decades, is a sign of how far those sports still have to go. “Today’s Black coach is the ‘70’s Black quarterback,” Rod Broadway, who coached at historically Black universities Grambling State and North Carolina A&T, said about the once-rare sight of an African American playing the sport’s most important position. There has been a backlash against affirmative action and the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that reached a crescendo in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement after George Floyd’s murder in 2020. Since then, theSupreme Court has struck down affirmative actionin college and university admissions process;Florida has gotten rid of fundingfor public universities to use for DEI programs; laws governingtransgender sportshave proliferated across the states. Against this backdrop comes football, and the questions of whether it is a reflection of society, a change agent for it or neither. Heading into this year’s postseason, Black men occupied 11.9% of the head-coaching positions at college football’s highest level. That was nearly 7% less than in the NFL, where the Rooney Rule was adopted in 2003, requiring teams to interview minority candidates for open spots. There is no such rule in college sports, beyond an initiative in the West Coast Conference, which does not play football. Freeman, whose father is African American and whose mother is South Korean, was thoughtful 11 days ago when asked about the historic nature of his victory in the semifinals, where he was going against Penn State and coach James Franklin, who also is Black. “It is an honor, and I hope all coaches, minorities, Black, Asian, white, it doesn’t matter, great people continue to get opportunities to lead young men like this,” Freeman said. The coach’s most trenchant statement about race and his role in opening up opportunities came not during Notre Dame’s current playoff run but rather in 2021 when he became the first Black coach in the school’s storied history. “I want to be a demonstration of what someone can do, and the level they can do it at, if they are given the OPPORTUNITY,” he said. “Because that’s what is needed: opportunity.” Yet, 41 years after Georgetown’s John Thompson became the first Black coach to win basketball’s national title and 26 years after Carolyn Peck at Purdue first did it on the women’s side, those opportunities in football are relatively few and far between. One of the watchdogs over minority hiring in American sports gave colleges a “C” on its last annual report card. “It was inevitable” that a Black coach would reach a football title game, said Richard Lapchick, the founder of The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at UCF. “But the inevitability took a lot longer than I think most people would’ve guessed a long time ago.” Now retired and living in South Carolina, Broadway has been filled with mixed feelings while watching this play out from afar. He told a story of being asked to interview for the open head-coaching position at a major university in the early 2010s. Broadway said he came down an escalator at the airport en route to the interview and saw TV cameras covering his every move. He recalled his unshakable belief that the cameras had been sent there solely to document that the school was interviewing a Black candidate, not that it was taking that interview seriously. “As God as my witness, I started to make the U-turn and go up the other escalator,” he said. “It was the most (expletive) interview I’d ever done in my life.” His take on the realities of Black coaches landing big jobs in college football haven’t changed all that much since then. He says he remains discouraged by the lack of a thriving pipeline for young Black coaches. And just as no one knows whether Freeman’s ascent marks a point in time or a sign of progress, Broadway has the same question about the recent rise of Deion Sanders and the hires of Black former NFL players Michael Vick (Norfolk State) and DeSean Jackson (Delaware State). Are they opening doors, or just filling vacant spots? “I know there are a lot of African American coaches who, if they had the opportunity, they’d be in the game,” Broadway said. “But there are some brilliant coaches who just don’t get their opportunities.” Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

(AP Photo/Leo Correa)                  As a ceasefire brought calm to Gaza’s ruined cities, Hamas was quick to emerge from hiding. The militant group has not only survived15 months of war with Israel— among the deadliest and most destructive in recent memory — but it remains firmly in control of the coastal territory that now resembles an apocalyptic wasteland. With a surge of humanitarian aid promised as part of the ceasefire deal, the Hamas-run government said Monday that it will coordinate distribution to the desperate people of Gaza. For all the military might Israel deployed in Gaza, it failed to remove Hamas from power, one of its central war aims. That could make a return to fighting more likely, but the results might be the same. There was an element of theater inSunday’s handover of three Israeli hostagesto the Red Cross, when dozens of masked Hamas fighters wearing green headbands and military fatigues paraded in front of cameras and held back a crowd of hundreds who surrounded the vehicles. The scenes elsewhere in Gaza were even more remarkable: Thousands of Hamas-run police in uniform re-emerged, making their presence known even in the most heavily destroyed areas. “The police have been here the whole time, but they were not wearing their uniforms” to avoid being targeted by Israel, said Mohammed Abed, a father of three who returned to his home in Gaza City more than seven months after fleeing the area.  “They were among the displaced people in the tents. That’s why there were no thefts,” he said. Other residents said the police had maintained offices in hospitals and other locations throughout the war, where people could report crimes. Israel has repeatedly blamed Hamas for the heavy civilian death toll and damage to infrastructure because the group’s fighters and security forces embed themselves in residential neighborhoods, schools and hospitals. Opinion polls consistently show that only a minority of Palestinians support Hamas. But the Islamic militant group —which does not accept Israel’s existence— is deeply rooted in Palestinian society, with an armed wing, a political party, media and charities that date back to its founding in the late 1980s. For decades, Hamas functioned as a well-organized insurgency, able to launch hit-and-run attacks on Israeli forces and suicide bombings in Israel itself.Many of its top leaders have been killed— and quickly replaced. It won a landslide victory in 2006 parliamentary elections, and the following year it seized Gaza from the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in a week of street battles. Hamas then established a fully-fledged government, with ministries, police and a civilian bureaucracy. Its security forces quickly brought Gaza’s powerful families into line and crushed rival armed groups. They also silenced dissent andviolently dispersed occasional protests. Hamas remained in power throughfour previous wars with Israel. With help from Iran it steadily enhanced its capabilities, extended the range of its rockets and built deeper and longer tunnels to hide from Israeli airstrikes. By Oct. 7, 2023, it had an army of tens of thousands in organized battalions. In the surprise incursion that triggered the war, its fighters attacked southern Israel by air, land and sea, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Hamas-led militants abducted 250 others. In response, Israel launched an air and ground war that has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and has reduced entire neighborhoodsto fields of rubble. Some 90% of Gaza’s population has been displaced, often multiple times. Nearly every day of the war, the Israeli military announced that it had killed dozens of fighters, or taken out a midlevel commander, or dismantled a tunnel complex or obliterated a weapons factory. Israeli forces killedHamas’ top leader, Yahya Sinwar, and most of his lieutenants. But the exiled leadership is mostly intact and Mohammed Sinwar, his brother, has reportedly assumed a bigger role in Gaza. The military says it has killed over 17,000 fighters — roughly half of Hamas’ estimated prewar ranks — though it has not provided evidence. What Israel said were carefully targeted strikes frequently killed women and children and in some caseswiped out entire extended families. The military blamed civilian casualties on Hamas. But survivors of the bombardment, crammed into tents after their homes were flattened, were a pool of potential recruits. Earlier this month, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a prepared speech that Hamas had recruited nearly as many fighters as it lost during the war. Michael Milshtein, an Israeli expert on Palestinian affairs and former military intelligence officer, said Hamas no longer has the ability to launch an Oct. 7-style attack but has returned to its insurgent roots, using creative tactics like harvesting unexploded Israeli ordnance for homemade bombs. “Hamas is a chameleon. It changed its colors according to the circumstances,” he said. “The war is ending with a strong perception of success for Hamas,” he added. “The enlistment capabilities will be crazy. They won’t be able to handle it.” Palestinian critics of Hamas have long said there is no military solution to the Mideast conflict, which predates the birth of the militant group by several decades. They argue that Palestinians would be more likely to break with Hamasif they had an alternative pathto ending Israel’s decades-long occupation,which has further entrenched itselfduring the war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose government is opposed to Palestinian statehood, has ensured they do not. He has rebuffed proposals from the United States and friendly Arab countries for a reformed Palestinian Authority to govern both Gaza and parts of the occupied West Bank ahead of eventual statehood. Instead, he has vowed to maintain open-ended security control over both territories. Avi Issacharoff, a veteran Israeli journalist — and co-creator of the Netflix hit “Fauda” — said Netanyahu’s refusal to plan for the day after was the “biggest debacle of this war.” “Israel is waking up from a nightmare into the very same nightmare,” he wrote in Israel’s Yediot Ahronot newspaper. “Hamas is going to remain in power and will continue to build more tunnels and recruit more men, without the emergence of any local alternative.” Netanyahu has threatened to resume the war after the first six-week phase of the ceasefire if Israel’s goals are not met, while Hamas has said it will not release dozens of remaining captives without a lasting truce and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. There’s no reason to think another military campaign would bring about a different result. In early October, Israeli forces sealed off the northern towns of Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and Jabaliya, barring nearly all humanitarian aid, forcing thousands to flee and destroying nearly every structure in their path, including schools and shelters, according to witnesses who fled. The army had carried out major operations in all three places previously, only to see militants regroup. At least 15 Israeli soldiers have died in northern Gaza this month alone. When residents returned to Jabaliya on Sunday, they found a sprawling scene of devastation with only a few tilted shells of buildings in a sea of gray rubble. Dozens of Hamas police kept watch over their return. Magdy reported from Cairo. Associated Press writer Tia Goldenberg in Tel Aviv, Israel contributed.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, File)                            ▶Follow live updates onPresident-elect Donald Trump’s return to Washington WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden, in one of his final acts as president, pardonedDr. Anthony Fauci, retiredGen. Mark Milleyand members of theHouse committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, in an extraordinary use of executive power to guard against potential “revenge” bythe new Trump administration. The decision Monday by Biden came after now-President Donald Trump had warned ofan enemies listfilled with those who have crossed him politically or sought to hold him accountable for his attemptto overturn his 2020 election lossand his role in the Capitol siege four years ago.Trump has selected Cabinet nominees who backed his election liesand who have pledged to punish those involved in efforts to investigate him. “The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense,” Biden said in a statement. “Our nation owes these public servants a debt of gratitude for their tireless commitment to our country.” The prospect of such pardons had been the subject of heated debate for months at the highest levels of the White House. It’s customary for a president to grant clemency at the end of his term, but those acts of mercy are usually offered to Americans who have been convicted of crimes. Trump said after his inauguration that Biden had pardoned people who were “very very guilty of very bad crimes” — “political thugs,” Trump called them. AP correspondent Ed Donahue reports on last-minute pardons in the Biden administration.  Biden, a Democrat, has used the power in the broadest and most untested way possible: to pardon those who have not even been investigated. His decision lays the groundwork for an even more expansive use of pardons by Trump, a Republican, and future presidents. While the Supreme Court last year ruled that presidents enjoybroad immunity from prosecutionfor what could be considered official acts, the president’s aides and allies enjoy no such shield. There is concern that future presidents could use the promise of a blanket pardon to encourage allies to take actions they might otherwise resist for fear of running afoul of the law. What to know about Donald Trump’s inauguration Donald Trump has been sworn in as the 47th President of the United States. It’s unclear whether those pardoned by Biden would need to apply for the clemency. Acceptance could be seen as a tacit admission of guilt or wrongdoing, validating years of attacks by Trump and his supporters, even though those who were pardoned have not been formally accused of any crimes. The “full and unconditional” pardons for Fauci and Milley cover the period extending back to Jan. 1, 2014. “These are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing,” Biden said, adding that “Even when individuals have done nothing wrong — and in fact have done the right thing — and will ultimately be exonerated, the mere fact of being investigated or prosecuted can irreparably damage reputations and finances.” Fauci was director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health for nearly 40 years, including during Trump’s term in office, and later served as Biden’s chief medical adviser until his retirement in 2022. He helped coordinate the nation’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and raised Trump’s ire when he resisted Trump’s untested public health notions. Fauci has since become a target of intense hatred and vitriol from people on the right, who blame him for mask mandates and other policies they believe infringed on their rights, even as hundreds of thousands of people were dying. “Despite the accomplishments that my colleagues and I achieved over my long career of public service, I have been the subject of politically-motivated threats of investigation and prosecution,” Fauci said in a statement. “There is absolutely no basis for these threats. Let me be perfectly clear: I have committed no crime.” Milley, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has called Trump a fascist and has detailed Trump’s conduct around the Jan. 6 insurrection. He said he was grateful to Biden for a pardon. “I do not wish to spend whatever remaining time the Lord grants me fighting those who unjustly might seek retribution for perceived slights,” he said in a statement. “I do not want to put my family, my friends, and those with whom I served through the resulting distraction, expense, and anxiety.” Shortly after Trump’s swearing-in, Milley’s official portrait at the Pentagon was removed from the wall. Biden also extended pardons to members and staff of the Jan. 6 committee that investigated the attack, as well as the U.S. Capitol and D.C. Metropolitan police officers who testified before the House committee about their experiences that day, overrun by an angry, violent mob of Trump supporters. It’s a “full and unconditional pardon,” for any offenses “which they may have committed or taken part in arising from or in any manner related to the activities or subject matter.” The committee spent 18 months investigating Trump and the insurrection. It was led by Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and then-Rep. Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican who later pledged to vote for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and campaigned with her against Trump. The committee’s final report found that Trump criminally engaged in a “multi-part conspiracy” to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election and failed to act to stop his supporters from attacking the Capitol. “Rather than accept accountability,” Biden said, “those who perpetrated the January 6th attack have taken every opportunity to undermine and intimidate those who participated in the Select Committee in an attempt to rewrite history, erase the stain of January 6th for partisan gain, and seek revenge, including by threatening criminal prosecutions.” Biden’s statement did not list the dozens of members and staff by name. Some did not know they were to receive pardons until it happened, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. Cheney and Thompson said in a statement on behalf of the committee that they were grateful for the decision, saying they were being pardoned “not for breaking the law but for upholding it.” “These are indeed ‘extraordinary circumstances’ when public servants are pardoned to prevent false prosecution by the government for having worked faithfully as members of Congress to expose the facts of a months long criminal effort to override the will of the voters after the 2020 election, including by inciting a violent insurrection,” the said in the statement. The extent of the legal protection offered by the pardons may not fully shield the lawmakers or their staff from other types of inquiries, particularly from Congress. Republicans on Capitol Hill would still likely have wide leverage to probe the committee’s actions, as the House GOP did in the last session of Congress, seeking testimony and other materials from those involved. Biden, an institutionalist, has promised a smooth transition to the next administration,inviting Trump to the White Houseand saying that the nation will be OK,even as he warned during his farewell address of a growing oligarchy. He hasspent years warning that Trump’s ascensionto the presidency again would be a threat to democracy. His decision to break with political norms was brought on by those concerns. Biden has set the presidential recordfor most individual pardons and commutations issued. He also pardonedhis son Hunterfor tax and gun crimes. Moments before leaving office,he pardoned his siblings and their spousesin a move designed to guard against potential retribution. He is not the first to consider such preemptive pardons. Trump aides considered them for Trump and his supporters involved in his failed efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election that culminated in the violent riot at the Capitol. But Trump’s pardons never materialized before he left office four years ago. President Gerald Ford granted a “full, free, and absolute pardon” in 1974 to his predecessor, Richard Nixon, over the Watergate scandal. Trump has promised to grant swift clemency to many of those involved in the Capitol riot. FormerMetropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, who lost consciousness and suffered a heart attack after a riotershocked him with a stun gun, was one of the officers who testified before the congressional panel that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack. Fanone said he learned of Biden’s last-minute pardons from a reporter. He said it was about protecting him and his family from a “vengeful party.” “I haven’t digested it,” he said. “I just can’t believe that this is my country.” AP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro and Associated Press writers Tara Copp, Alanna Durkin Richer and Michael Kunzelman contributed to this report.

        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "Passive training with robotic exoskeleton hand even led to motor improvements in the untrained hand. When it comes to fine-tuned motor skills like playing the piano, practice, they say, makes perfect. But expert musicians often experience a \"ceiling effect,\" in which their skill level plateaus after extensive training. Passive training using a robotic exoskeleton hand could help pianists overcome that ceiling effect, according to apaperpublished in the journal Science Robotics. “I’m a pianist, but I [injured] my hand because of overpracticing,” coauthor Shinichi Furuya of Kabushiki Keisha Sony Computer Science Kenkyujotold New Scientist. “I was suffering from this dilemma, between overpracticing and the prevention of the injury, so then I thought, I have to think about some way to improve my skills without practicing.” Recalling that his former teachers used to place their hands over his to show him how to play more advanced pieces, he wondered if he could achieve the same effect with a robotic hand. So Furuya et al. used a custom-made exoskeleton robot hand capable of moving individual fingers on the right hand independently, flexing and extending the joints as needed. Per the authors, prior studies with robotic exoskeletons focused on simpler movements, such as assisting in the movement of limbs stabilizing body posture, or helping grasp objects. That sets the custom robotic hand used in these latest experiments apart from those used for haptics in virtual environments. A total of 118 pianists participated in three different experiments. In the first, 30 pianists performed a designated \"chord trill\" motor task with the piano at home every day for two weeks: first simultaneously striking D and F keys with the right index and ring fingers, then striking the E and G keys with the right middle and little fingers. \"We used this task because it has been widely recognized as technically challenging to play quickly and accurately,\" the authors explained. It appears in such classical pieces as Chopin's Etude Op. 25. No. 6, Maurice Ravel's \"Ondine,\" and the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 3. The pianists performed the task at a tempo of 80 BPM for ten seconds, followed by a ten-second rest for 30 sessions. After two weeks, they were assigned to one of two laboratory groups, in which the robot exoskeleton hand passively moved those four fingers for 30 minutes to perform the chord trill—faster than the players could do so themselves. This was followed by a post-test session in which the pianists played the chord trill twice for five seconds, as quickly and accurately as possible. The second experiment was designed to pinpoint the elements of movement that led to the enhanced motor skills, involving 60 pianists randomly assigned to one of five groups and getting different interventions. The results: \"Even when the skill plateaued after weeks of piano practice, passive training of the fast and complex motor skill with the robot further facilitated the maximum rate of repetitive piano keystrokes involving fast and complex multifinger movements,\" the authors wrote, and the training effect also showed up in the untrained hand, so there was an \"inter-manual transfer effect.\" In other words, the hand exoskeleton allows \"skilled individuals achieve otherwise impossible motions,\" and is thus an effective way to overcome the ceiling effect. A third experiment aimed to assess any changes in neuroplasticity in the corticospinal system during passive training. This involved 28 pianists undergoing the same lab-based protocol as the first experiment while undergoing electromyographic (EMG) monitoring, and stimulated regions of the motor cortex associated with finger movements before and after training sessions. Only the hand trained by the exoskeleton showed pattern changes in multifinger movements, which the authors suggest is evidence of neuronal adaptation from the passive training. More research is needed into why the untrained hand also showed improved motor skills. The authors acknowledge that participants were limited by the risk of muscular fatigue. For instance, one experiment involved five trials in which pianists played as fast as they could at the maximum rate for ten seconds, but players found it difficult to do so for longer periods, or for more than ten trials. Still, the authors believe their study \"highlights the importance of embodying otherwise impossible skills using augmentation technology such as a robotic exoskeleton.\" It could also prove useful for rehabilitation of certain neurological disorders that affect manual dexterity.

        "title": "Trek FX+ 7S e-bike is a premium city commuter",
        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "The FX+ 7S improves just about everything from the FX+ 2, but doubles its price tag. Post-pandemic, my creed became\"Bicycles deliver the freedom that auto ads promise.\"That belief is why I’ve almost exclusively used a bike to move myself around Portland, Oregon since (yes, I have become aPortlandiastereotype). However, that lifestyle is a lot more challenging without some pedal assistance. For a few summers, I showed up sweaty to appointments after pedaling on a $200 single-speed. So in 2024, I purchased the FX+ 2, based primarily onmy managing editor’s review. It’s since been a workhorse for my daily transportation needs for the past year; I've put more than 1,000 miles on it in eight months. So given my experience with that bike, I was the natural choice to review Trek’s upgraded version,the FX+ 7S. First off, my time with the FX+ 2 has been great—no regrets about that purchase. But my one quibble is with the battery. Due to the frequency and length of my rides, I need to charge the bike more often than not, and I sometimes experience range anxiety riding to the opposite side of town. Even though both e-bikes are considered lightweight at 40 pounds, they’re still not the easiest things to pedal sans assist, and I’m reliant on their built-in lighting systems after dark. But I didn't have to worry about my remaining charge with the FX+ 7 and its 360 Wh battery. Its extra capacity gives me much less range anxiety, as I can ride without fear of losing juice on the route home. And the LCD on the frame gives you a clear indicator of how much distance and time you have left in your ride, which is always handy. I would caution, however, about relying too much on your estimated distance remaining. During a 15-mile, hour-long ride while fluctuating between the first two assist levels I had modified, I drained 61 percent of the battery. While the estimated time remaining on my ride was consistent and accurate, the predicted mileage dropped occasionally, although that’s probably because I was changing the assist level frequently. There were also a couple of occasions where I was trying to drain the battery completely on a ride home, and after switching the assist level, the motor gave out at around 10–15 percent charge remaining, according to the LCD info (the lights, however, stayed on). It wasn’t a terrible inconvenience since I was close to home, but it’s not ideal for anyone hoping to ride consistently with some level of assist. (Trek offers a160 Wh range extender for $550. I doubt you’ll need it, considering the range on the bike—which can be around 60 miles on an unmodified eco setting—but it’s available if you want the extra juice.) TheTQ-HPR50 motoris also a big improvement over my bike'sHyena Gen 2(50 Nm versus 40 Nm of torque). The timing for the FX+ 2 pedal assist was unadjustable and always a bit slow to kick in, but after tweaking the settings through theTrek Central App, the extra power on the FX+ 7S was evident in all aspects of my ride. I no longer experienced a lengthy lurch as I began pedaling from a full stop, and using a Level 3 assist made any uphill climb a breeze. The bike is also remarkably quiet; on one occasion, I was riding alongside a friend who was riding a different manufacturer’s e-bike, and the noise coming from his ride was noticeable; mine wasn’t. It’s also a Class 3 e-bike, which means it can offer pedal-assisted speeds of up to 28 mph (45 kph), but it doesn’t provide any throttle. Trek markets this bike as the ultimate city commuter, and can I see why. I’ve ridden it for several weeks during a dreary Pacific Northwest winter, where the roads are constantly slick and full of debris. Did any of that affect the bike’s performance? Not that I can tell. Despite the gunky roads (and panniers filled with groceries), the aluminum-frame bike performed great, and the hydraulic disc brakes provided plenty of stopping power in wet conditions. The Shimano CUES U6000 drivetrain with a 10-speed shifter never experienced a hiccup. Even riding through the foliage muck and with extra cargo weight, I experienced smoother pedaling and was less impacted by all the bumps and debris in the road, making it even more comfortable to ride than the already-pleasant FX+ 2. The only rough spot I experienced was getting a punctured tube due to a shard of glass in the road, but that’s not thetire’sfault (and it’s typical of Portland). Trek also added other upgraded commuter considerations: The price of the FX+ 2 ($2,500 at the time; it’s now being sold at $1,850) was a downside we noted in our review, and it's the main gripe I have with the FX+ 7S, which sells for $4,000. While it’s a better bike by every measure, is the advanced model worth more than twice the price? Your budget and feature wish list for a commuter bike will have to answer that question. If price isn’t a concern and you’re looking for a bike that is built to last longer, opt for the FX+ 7S. It’s better in every regard (except it looks more like an e-bike than its predecessor due to the LCD screen; I did appreciate how often people were surprised to hear the FX+ 2 was electric). If you’re mostly concerned about the range and are unwilling to spend $4,000, opt for the FX+ 2 and get the range extender. In either case, you’re getting a quality bike that will perform well and give you the freedom to ditch the car for many of your daily commutes.

        "source": "https://nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "From dopamine deficits to withdrawal symptoms, detoxing from social media can be challenging. This is how to make it work for you. Think you’re spending too much time scrolling on your phone? You’re not alone. TheaverageAmerican adult logs over two hours a day on social media, while teensdouble thaton platforms like TikTok and Instagram. As experts warn of theaddictive featuresof social networks, more people are looking for ways to break free—evidenced by a 60 percent surge inGoogle searchesfor “social media detox” in recent months. But does stepping away from your feed really make a difference? Researchers say yes, and the benefits for your brain and well-being might surprise you. Many of us suspect we spend too much time scrolling—a concern underscored by Oxford University Press selecting “brain rot” as 2024’s word of the year. But finding the willpower to cut back is not an easy feat, thanks to how social media taps into our brain’s reward system. Anna Lembke, addiction medicine expert and author ofDopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence, explains that people can get addicted to digital media just like they can get addicted to drugs. Based on what we know about how drugs and alcohol affect the brain, we can infer that a similar process takes place when we check social media, with every like, comment, or cute cat video triggering a surge of dopamine, the brain’s “feel-good” chemical. However, our brain is designed to maintain an overall dopamine balance—what Lembke describes as a teeter-tottermechanism. Endless scrolling eventually disrupts this balance, prompting the brain to compensate by producing less dopamine or slowing its transmission. Over time, this can lead us into a state of “dopamine deficit,” where we need more time online to get back to feeling “normal.” (This is your brain on dating apps.) Hitting “pause” on this social-media-induced dopamine cycle can allow the brain to reset reward pathways, Lembke says, allowing us to stop the kind of compulsive overconsumption that leads to “brain rot.” There is no one-size-fts-all solution when it comes to social media detoxing, saysPaige Coyne, co-author of astudyon the health impacts of a two-week social media detox on 31 young adults. “Excessive social media use can mean different things to different people,” she says, adding that what’s key is to make realistic goals to bring down our usual social media consumption. “Some people may want to give it up entirely while others may want to cut down time spent on social media by half.” To help rewire the brain reward pathways, Lembke recommends abstaining for as long as you can—ideally at least four weeks. But even short breaks have proved effective for improving mental health. Astudyof 65 girls aged 10 to 19 found that taking a three-day break from social media improved their self-esteem and self-compassion, resulting in lower body shame. Whether you decide to stop using social media for a few weeks or limit your everyday use for some time, you’ll probably find the first few days are the hardest to get through, saysSarah Woodruff, who co-authored the social media detox study with Coyne. Experiencing “withdrawal symptoms” like cravings or anxiety is to be expected, Lembke says, as the brain adjusts to lower levels of dopamine. But enduring these uncomfortable feelings allows our brain reward pathways to reboot and stop the cycle of craving and consuming. Eventually, the cravings will stop, and it will be easier to get through the day without constant dopamine hits. “As the days went by, people found that the detox was easier than they had expected,” Woodruff says. “Once they got into a groove most people enjoyed it.” (A new study shows social media use is tied to nightmares.) By the end of the two-week detox, where social media consumption was capped to 30 minutes per day, most participants reported mental health benefits such as greater life satisfaction, reduced stress levels, and improved sleep compared with the period before the study. Getting over the hump may be easier if you join forces with one or more detox buddies. In the study on teen girls,Tomi-Ann Roberts, a professor of psychology at Colorado College, asked participants to check in with each other through a WhatsApp group during each day of the experiment to find support. “We found that girls experienced feelings of disconnection and fear of missing out,” Roberts says, “but they could share their experience with others, so they felt less alone.” On top of rewiring our brain’s reward pathways, taking a temporary break from social media can make us more aware of our relationship with social media platforms. “We can use this time to take a step back and become more aware of what is it that we do [on social media] and whether it benefits us,” Woodruff says. “Things like do I get everything that I need to get done in a day or I am missing out on face-to-face interaction because of social media.” After a period of detox, it is important to create guardrails to avoid falling back into compulsive overconsumption, Lembke says. “I recommend creating physical or mental barriers between us and social media,” she says. “Things like not keeping our phone in the bedroom or turning off notifications.” (”Urgency culture“ might lead you to burnout. Here’s how can you combat it?) Replacing the quick-hitting dopamine hits with less-instant types of gratification can also help keep brain reward pathways in balance. “Healthy sources of dopamine usually come with upfront work,” Lembke says, citing things like playing an instrument or cooking, “when we engage with actions that require our attention our brain will release dopamine with some delay keeping the overall balance in check.” Finally, experts recommend scheduling periods of social media detox throughout the year to maintain a balanced social media use. “We can’t get rid of social media altogether,” Woodruff says, “but taking a break once in a while can help us reset and take stock of how we are using these platforms and how they make us feel.” Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2025 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

        "title": "Sleeping pills stop the brain’s system for cleaning out waste",
        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "A specialized system sends pulses of pressure through the fluids in our brain. Our bodies rely on their lymphatic system to drain excessive fluids and remove waste from tissues, feeding those back into the blood stream. It’s a complex yet efficient cleaning mechanism that works in every organ except the brain. “When cells are active, they produce waste metabolites, and this also happens in the brain. Since there are no lymphatic vessels in the brain, the question was what was it that cleaned the brain,” Natalie Hauglund, a neuroscientist at Oxford University who led a recent study on the brain-clearing mechanism, told Ars. Earlier studies done mostly on mice discovered that the brain had a system that flushed its tissues with cerebrospinal fluid, which carried away waste products in a process called glymphatic clearance. “Scientists noticed that this only happened during sleep, but it was unknown what it was about sleep that initiated this cleaning process,” Hauglund explains. Her study found the glymphatic clearance was mediated by a hormone called norepinephrine and happened almost exclusively during the NREM sleep phase. But it only worked when sleep was natural. Anesthesia and sleeping pills shut this process down nearly completely. The glymphatic system in the brain was discovered back in 2013 by Dr. Maiken Nedergaard, a Danish neuroscientist and a coauthor of Hauglund’s paper. Since then, there have been numerous studies aimed at figuring out how it worked, but most of them had one problem: they were done on anesthetized mice. “What makes anesthesia useful is that you can have a very controlled setting,” Hauglund says. Most brain imaging techniques require a subject, an animal or a human, to be still. In mouse experiments, that meant immobilizing their heads so the research team could get clear scans. “But anesthesia also shuts down some of the mechanisms in the brain,” Hauglund argues. So, her team designed a study to see how the brain-clearing mechanism works in mice that could move freely in their cages and sleep naturally whenever they felt like it. “It turned out that with the glymphatic system, we didn’t really see the full picture when we used anesthesia,” Hauglund says. Looking into the brain of a mouse that runs around and wiggles during sleep, though, wasn’t easy. The team pulled it off by using a technique called flow fiber photometry which works by imaging fluids tagged with fluorescent markers using a probe implanted in the brain. So, the mice got the optical fibers implanted in their brains. Once that was done, the team put fluorescent tags in the mice’s blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and on the norepinephrine hormone. “Fluorescent molecules in the cerebrospinal fluid had one wavelength, blood had another wavelength, and norepinephrine had yet another wavelength,” Hauglund says. This way, her team could get a fairly precise idea about the brain fluid dynamics when mice were awake and asleep. And it turned out that the glymphatic system basically turned brain tissues into a slowly moving pump. “Norepinephrine is released from a small area of the brain in the brain stem,” Hauglund says. “It is mainly known as a response to stressful situations. For example, in fight or flight scenarios, you see norepinephrine levels increasing.” Its main effect is causing blood vessels to contract. Still, in more recent research, people found out that during sleep, norepinephrine is released in slow waves that roll over the brain roughly once a minute. This oscillatory norepinephrine release proved crucial to the operation of the glymphatic system. “When we used the flow fiber photometry method to look into the brains of mice, we saw these slow waves of norepinephrine, but we also saw how it works in synchrony with fluctuation in the blood volume,” Hauglund says. Every time the norepinephrine level went up, it caused the contraction of the blood vessels in the brain, and the blood volume went down. At the same time, the contraction increased the volume of the perivascular spaces around the blood vessels, which were immediately filled with the cerebrospinal fluid. When the norepinephrine level went down, the process worked in reverse: the blood vessels dilated, letting the blood in and pushing the cerebrospinal fluid out. “What we found was that norepinephrine worked a little bit like a conductor of an orchestra and makes the blood and cerebrospinal fluid move in synchrony in these slow waves,” Hauglund says. And because the study was designed to monitor this process in freely moving, undisturbed mice, the team learned exactly when all this was going on. When mice were awake, the norepinephrine levels were much higher but relatively steady. The team observed the opposite during the REM sleep phase, where the norepinephrine levels were consistently low. The oscillatory behavior was present exclusively during the NREM sleep phase. So, the team wanted to check how the glymphatic clearance would work when they gave the mice zolpidem, a sleeping drug that had been proven toincreaseNREM sleep time. In theory, zolpidem should have boosted brain-clearing. But it turned it off instead. “When we looked at the mice after giving them zolpidem, we saw they all fell asleep very quickly. That was expected—we take zolpidem because it makes it easier for us to sleep,” Hauglund says. “But then we saw those slow fluctuations in norepinephrine, blood volume, and cerebrospinal fluid almost completely stopped.” No fluctuations meant the glymphatic system didn’t remove any waste. This was a serious issue, because one of the cellular waste products it is supposed to remove is amyloid beta, found in the brains of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Hauglund speculates it could be possible zolpidem induces a state very similar to sleep but at the same time it shuts down important processes that happen during sleep. While heavy zolpidem use has been associated withincreased risk of the Alzheimer disease, it is not clear if this increased risk was there because the drug was inhibiting oscillatory norepinephrine release in the brain. To better understand this, Hauglund wants to get a closer look into how the glymphatic system works in humans. “We know we have the same wave-like fluid dynamics in the brain, so this could also drive the brain clearance in humans,” Haugland told Ars. “Still, it’s very hard to look at norepinephrine in the human brain because we need an invasive technique to get to the tissue.” But she said norepinephrine levels in people can be estimated based on indirect clues. One of them is pupil dilation and contraction, which work in in synchrony with the norepinephrine levels. Another other clue may lay in microarousals—very brief, imperceivable awakenings which, Hauglund thinks, can be correlated with the brain clearing mechanism. “I am currently interested in this phenomenon […]. Right now we have no idea why microarousals are there or what function they have” Hauglund says. But the last step she has on her roadmap is making better sleeping pills. “We need sleeping drugs that don’t have this inhibitory effect on the norepinephrine waves. If we can have a sleeping pill that helps people sleep without disrupting their sleep at the same time it will be very important,” Hauglund concludes. Cell, 2025.

        "source": "https://nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "A civil rights legend, Dr. King fought for justice through peaceful protest—and delivered some of the 20th century's most iconic speeches. The Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., is a civil rights legend. In the mid-1950s, King led the movement to end segregation and counter prejudice in the United States through the means of peaceful protest. His speeches—some of the most iconic of the 20th century—had a profound effect on the national consciousness. Through his leadership, the civil rights movement opened doors to education and employment that had long been closed to Black America. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan signed a bill creating a federal holiday to honor King for his commitment to equal rights and justice for all. Observed for the first time on January 20, 1986, it’s called Martin Luther King Jr. Day. In January 2000, Martin Luther King Jr. Day wasofficially observed in all 50 U.S. states. Here’s what you need to know about King’s extraordinary life. Though King's name is known worldwide,many may not realize that he was born Michael King, Jr.in Atlanta, Georgia on January 15, 1929. His father, Michael King, was a pastor at theEbenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. During a trip to Germany, King, Sr. was so impressed by the history of Protestant Reformation leader Martin Luther that he changed not only his own name, but also five-year-old Michael’s. His brilliance was noted early, ashe was accepted into Morehouse College, ahistorically Black schoolin Atlanta, at age 15. By the summer before his last year of college, King knew he was destined to continue the family profession of pastoral work and decided to enter the ministry. He received his Bachelor’s degree from Morehouse at age 19, and then enrolled in Crozer Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania, graduating with a Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1951. He earned a doctorate in systematic theology from Boston University in 1955. King married Coretta Scott on June 18, 1953, on the lawn of her parents' house in her hometown of Heiberger, Alabama.They became the parents of four children: Yolanda King (1955–2007), Martin Luther King III (b. 1957), Dexter Scott King (b. 1961), and Bernice King (b. 1963). In 1954, when he was 25 years old, Dr. King became pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama.In March 1955, Claudette Colvin—a 15-year-old Black schoolgirlin Montgomery—refused to give up her bus seat to a white man, which was a violation of Jim Crow laws, local laws in the southern United States that enforced racial segregation. (Jim Crow laws created 'slavery by another name.') King was on the committee from the Birmingham African-American community that looked into the case. The local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) briefly considered using Colvin's case to challenge the segregation laws, but decided that because she was so young—and had become pregnant—her case would attract too much negative attention. Nine months later on December 1, 1955, a similar incident occurred when aseamstress named Rosa Parks was arrestedfor refusing to give up her seat on a city bus. The two incidents led to theMontgomery bus boycott, which was urged and planned by the President of the Alabama Chapter of the NAACP, E.D. Nixon, and led by King. The boycott lasted for 385 days. King’s prominent and outspoken role in the boycott led to numerous threats against his life, and his house was firebombed. He was arrested during the campaign, which concluded with a United States District Court ruling inBrowder v. Gayle(in which Colvin was a plaintiff) that ended racial segregation on all Montgomery public buses. King's role in the bus boycott transformed him into a national figure and the best-known spokesman of the civil rights movement. From the early days of the Montgomery boycott, Kinghad often referredto India’sMahatma Gandhias “the guiding light of our technique of nonviolent social change.” In 1957, King, Ralph Abernathy, Fred Shuttlesworth, Joseph Lowery, and other civil rights activists founded theSouthern Christian Leadership Conferenceto harness the organizing power of Black churches to conduct nonviolent protests to ultimately achieve civil rights reform. The group was part of what was called “The Big Five” of civil rights organizations, which included the NAACP, the National Urban League, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and the Congress on Racial Equality. Through his connections with the Big Five civil rights groups, overwhelming support from Black America and with the support of prominent individual well-wishers, King’s skill and effectiveness grew exponentially. He organized and led marches for Blacks' right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other basic civil rights. (How the U.S. Voting Rights Act was won—and why it's under fire today.) On August 28, 1963, The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom became the pinnacle of King’s national and international influence. Before a crowd of 250,000 people,he delivered the legendary “I Have A Dream” speechon the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. That speech, along with many others that King delivered, has hada lasting influence on world rhetoric. In 1964, King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his civil rights and social justice activism. Most of the rights King organized protests around were successfully enacted into law with the passage of theCivil Rights Act of 1964and the1965 Voting Rights Act. King’s opposition to the Vietnam War became a prominent part of his public persona. On April 4, 1967—exactly one year before his death—he gave a speech called “Beyond Vietnam” in New York City, in which he proposed a stop to the bombing of Vietnam. King also suggested that the United States declare a truce with the aim of achieving peace talks, and that the U.S. set a date for withdrawal. (King's advocacy for human rights around the world still inspires today.) Ultimately, King was driven to focus on social and economic justice in the United States. He had traveled to Memphis, Tennessee in early April 1968 to help organize a sanitation workers’ strike, and on the night of April 3, he delivered thelegendary “I've Been to the Mountaintop\" speech, in which he compared the strike to the long struggle for human freedom and the battle for economic justice, using the New Testament's Parable of the Good Samaritan to stress the need for people to get involved. But King would not live to realize that vision. The next day, April 4, 1968,King was gunned down on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis by James Earl Ray, a small-time criminal who had escaped the year before from a maximum-security prison. Ray was charged and convicted of the murder and sentenced to 99 years in prison on March 10, 1969. But Ray changed his mind after three days in jail, claiming he was not guilty and had been framed. He spent the rest of his life fighting unsuccessfully for a trial, despite the ultimate support of some members of the King family and the Reverend Jesse Jackson. The turmoil that flowed from King’s assassination led many Black Americans to wonder if that dream he had spoken of so eloquently had died with him. But, today, people around the world still learn about King's life and legacy—and his vision of equality and justice for all continue to resonate.
