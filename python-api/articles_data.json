Huh) LOS ANGELES (AP) — The latest evidence that homeownership is becoming increasingly less accessible to many Americans: Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last year to a nearly 30-year low for the second time in as many years. Elevated mortgage rates, a yearslong shortage of homes on the market andrecord-high home pricescontinued to stymie prospective home shoppers, especially first-time buyers. That led existing home sales to fall 0.7% last year to 4.06 million — the weakest showing for home sales since 1995 and edging out the terrible year for sales in 2023, the National Association of Realtors said Friday. Even in the midst of a sales slump, a dearth of homes on the market and rising mortgage rates gave sellers an edge over buyers, helping drive up the national median home price for all of last year to an all-time high $407,500, an increase of 4.7% from a year earlier. “How is it possible that home sales can be this low, considering that the U.S. population has increased by more than 70 million over this time period from 1995 to today?” asked Lawrence Yun, the NAR’s chief economist. “One can partly answer that question because of the affordability issue. Record-high home prices, mortgage rates having risen, but also lack of inventory.” The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump dating back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage surged to a 23-year high of nearly 8% in October 2023 and briefly fell to a 2-year low last September, but has beenmostly hovering around 7%,according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac.  The buying power of Americans now facing higher costs to borrow money for homes that have soared in value has been significantly stunted. With so few homes up for sale, millions of would-be homebuyers have found themselves on the sidelines. At the end of December, there were just 1.15 million homes on the market, NAR said. While that was up 16.2% from a year earlier, the inventory remained well below the annual historical average of about 1.98 million, according to data going back to 1999. The available inventory at the end of last month amounts to a 3.3-month supply, going by the current sales pace. In a more balanced market between buyers and sellers, there is a 4- to 6-month supply. “This means that the problems in the U.S. housing market continue to worsen in terms of availability of homes for sale and the upward pressure on home prices,” Eugenio Aleman, chief economist at Raymond James, wrote in a research note. Many factors have contributed to the housing shortage, including more than a decade of below-average new home construction and homeowners hanging on to their properties longer. And while President Donald Trump made increasing the housing supply one of his election campaign platforms, there are no quick fixes. “Over the past decade, the U.S. has averaged about 5.2 million home sales annually,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS. “It is going to take years before we are back at that level, maybe not even until the 2030s. The lack of inventory is the key constraint.” A sharp drop in the mortgage rate boosted the purchasing power of Americans in 2020 and 2021. While many economists predict that the average rate on a 30-year mortgage will ease this year, they generally don’t expect it to fall below 6%, about twice what it was five years ago. When mortgage rates ease, they can encourage home shoppers. A pullback in rates last fall helped home sales increase on a monthly basis in the last three months of the year. Home sales in December rose 2.2% from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis to a 4.24 million annual pace, NAR said. That topped the 4.2 million pace forecast by analysts polled by FactSet. Sales rose 9.3% in December versus the same month last year. The median home sales price rose for the 18th consecutive month in December to $404,000, up 6% from a year earlier. Limited inventory, especially in the more affordable price range of a given market, helps drive prices higher. That’s one reason many first-time homebuyers, who don’t have any home equity to put toward their down payment, continue to struggle. They accounted for 31% of all homes sold last month, up from 30% in November and 29% in December 2023. However, the annual share of first-time buyers was 24%. It’s been 40% historically.

The government is consulting on whether to let tech firms use copyrighted material to help train artificial intelligence models unless the creators explicitly opt out. McCartney told the BBC that would make it harder for artists to retain control of their work and undermine Britain’s creative industries. “You get young guys, girls, coming up, and they write a beautiful song, and they don’t own it, and they don’t have anything to do with it. And anyone who wants can just rip it off,” the 82-year-oldformer Beatlesaid in an interview to be broadcast Sunday. An extract was released Saturday by the BBC. “The truth is, the money’s going somewhere. When it gets on the streaming platforms, somebody is getting it, and it should be the person who created it. It shouldn’t be some tech giant somewhere.” Britain’s center-leftLabour Party governmentsays it wants to make the U.K. a world leader in AI. In December, it announced a consultation into how copyright law can “enable creators and right holders to exercise control over, and seek remuneration for, the use of their works for AI training” while also ensuring “AI developers have easy access to a broad range of high-quality creative content.” Publishers, artists’ organizations and media companies, including The Associated Press, have banded together as the Creative Rights in AI Coalition to oppose weakening copyright protections. “We’re the people, you’re the government. You’re supposed to protect us. That’s your job,” McCartney said. “So you know, if you’re putting through a bill, make sure you protect the creative thinkers, the creative artists, or you’re not going to have them.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "Palestinians face challenges of rebuilding lives torn apart by Gaza war. Gaza has become a wasteland of ruins and rubble due to Israel's conflict with Hamas following the terror organization's surprise attack on Oct. 7, 2023. However, now that a ceasefire is in place, families are returning to their neighborhoods, hoping to rebuild the places they once called home. One of the families excited to be back is the Ghaly family. After leaving the tents they had lived in for months, they are taking the few possessions they still have. As they returned to see the rubble, evidence of the destructive force where no building was left untouched, they also saw their family home. \"This is our four-story home,\" Eyad Abu Ghaly said. \"It has been completely flattened, and there was no reason for that. We don’t understand why the house was bombed.\" Eyad further explains, “The resistance does not exist here — just civilians.” Many homes that are still standing are wrecked inside, and as people wonder how they will ever rebuild, there’s also fear that war will soon return. \"I look at young people and wonder, 'Where will they go?'\" Ghaly said. \"There’s no future for them — no education, no health care. There is no life, no life at all.\" The agreement between Hamas and Israel, which ended the fighting and resulted in three Israeli hostages being freed on Sunday and reuniting with their families, was initially based on a six-week ceasefire. On Inauguration Day, President Donald Trump stated he was not confident that a second phase of the deal could be reached to prolong the truce and free all remaining hostages, both living and deceased. Tal Haimi was killed in the Oct. 7 massacre, but his body was taken into Gaza by Hamas. His cousin, Udi Goren, said that if Israel prioritizes the release of all hostages, it will further weaken Hamas. \"It is in our interest,\" Goren said. \"Bring back the hostages because that's more valuable to Hamas than anything else. And once we have the hostages back home, then we need to keep doing what we're actually doing right now, collaborating with the mediators in creating a different future for Gaza, where Hamas is not a part of it.\" But as soon as the ceasefire kicked in in Gaza, Hamas gunmen were parading through the streets. Then, the hostage handover was used to show they were back in charge. With no sign that Hamas is willing to capitulate, a former Israeli general close to the Israeli government states that it is unlikely the six-week ceasefire will be prolonged. Retired Israel Defense Forces Brigadier General Amir Avivi told ABC News that Israel is discussing a second deal. Yet this deal involves not just the release of hostages, but also requires Hamas to surrender, relinquish its control over Gaza, and vacate the area. \"And we will have to pressure and continue degrading Hamas capabilities to an extent where they will understand that it's game over,\" Avivi said. While teams in Gaza search the rubble for more bodies, there is no clear sense of who or what could govern Gaza if Hamas were to be removed. According to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, the war has already claimed 47,000 lives. Some 1,200 were killed in southern Israel during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, according to Israeli officials. In examining Gaza before the war and observing the devastation now, aid agencies warn that thousands more dead have not yet been counted or found. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "Prosecutors say they won’t charge rocker Marilyn Manson after a years-long investigation into sexual assault and domestic violence allegations LOS ANGELES --Prosecutors said Friday that they will not file charges againstMarilyn Mansonafter a years-long investigation of allegations of sexual assault and domestic violence. Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said the allegations are too old under the law and the evidence is not sufficient to charge the 56-year-old shock rocker whose legal name is Brian Warner. “We have determined that allegations of domestic violence fall outside of the statute of limitations, and we cannot prove charges of sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt,” Hochman said. “We recognize and applaud the courage and resilience of the women who came forward to make reports and share their experiences, and we thank them for their cooperation and patience with the investigation.” Nearly four years after the investigation began, then-District Attorney George Gascón said on Oct. 9 that his office was pursuing new leads that added to the “already extensive” file that authorities had amassed. LA County sheriff’s detectives said early in 2021 that they were investigating Manson for incidents between 2009 and 2011 in West Hollywood, where Manson lived at the time. The probe included a search warrant that was served on his West Hollywood home. The case was initially turned over to prosecutors in September 2021, but the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office requested more evidence-gathering andthe investigation resumed. “We are very pleased that, after a thorough and incredibly lengthy review of all of the actual evidence, the District Attorney has concluded what we knew and expressed from the start — Brian Warner is innocent,” his attorney, Howard King, said in a statement. The identities of the women police and prosecutors spoke to were not revealed, but “Game of Thrones” actor Esmé Bianco — who sued Manson in a case that has been settled — said she was part of the criminal investigation. Before the decision not to prosecute, she criticized how long the process was taking at a rally for Hochman, who was elected soon after. “Almost four years ago, I did what victims of rape are supposed to do: I went to the police,” she said on Oct. 10. “I described to them in agonizing detail how the rock musician Brian Warner — better known by his stage name Marilyn Manson — had raped and abused me over the course of our relationship.” Bianco said she gave investigators “hundreds of pieces of evidence, including photos of my body covered in bites, bruises and knife wounds, emails and text messages, threats to my immigration status.” In her lawsuit, Bianco alleged sexual, physical and emotional abuse, and said that Manson violated human trafficking law by bringing her to California from England for non-existent roles in music videos and movies. “Whilst I am deeply disappointed by the decision of the District Attorney to not bring charges in the case against Brian Warner, I am sadly not surprised,” Bianco said in a statement released by her lawyer. “Once again, our justice system has failed survivors. Not the individual prosecutors and detectives who worked for years on this case, but the system that made them do so with one hand tied behind their collective backs.” In 2021 Manson's former fiancée, “Westworld” actor Evan Rachel Wood, named him as her abuser for the first time in an Instagram post. Wood and Manson’s relationship became public in 2007 when he was 38 and she was 19, and they were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up. “He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years,” Wood said. Manson replied on Instagram that these were “horrible distortions of reality.” He sued Wood, saying she and another woman fabricated accusations against him and convinced others to do the same. A judge threw out significant sections of the suit, then in November, Manson agreed to drop it and pay Wood's attorney fees. The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they’ve been sexually abused, unless they come forward publicly as Bianco and Wood have done. Other women sued Manson in the months after Wood came forward. Wood's representative did not immedately return a message Friday. Manson emerged as a musical star in the mid-1990s, known as much for courting public controversy as for hit songs like “The Beautiful People” and hit album’s like 1996’s “Antichrist Superstar” and 1998’s “Mechanical Animals.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)                              FRESNO, Texas (AP) — The only moment TiAnna Yeldell has to herself is when she’s sleeping, and that doesn’t happen much. The 44-year-old single mom of three works 80-hour weeks to provide for her children, ages 8, 14, and 18. During the day, she is a driver for Pizza Hut, where she earns $9.50 an hour before tips. At night, she cleans trains for Houston’s Metro system, where she earns about $17 an hour. The times that she pulls both shifts, Yeldell sleeps for just two to three hours before getting her kids up and ready for school. Then she does it all over again. Yeldell is among the millions of fast food workers across the U.S. scraping to get by. Abouttwo-thirdsof them are women, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and many are supporting their families on minimum wages set at the federal government’s floor of $7.25 an hour. Fast food workers are disproportionately Hispanic, making up 24.6% of the industry’s workforce compared with 18.8% of the overall workforce. And more than half of all U.S. fast food workers are 20 or older, “contrary to the myth of it being a teenage job that they just do for pocket money,” said Tsedeye Gebreselassie, an attorney for nonprofit advocacy organization National Employment Law Project. TiAnna Yeldell, a 44-year-old single mom of three, prepares to make a delivery for Pizza Hut, Thursday, Nov. 14, 2024, in Missouri City, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)  President Donald Trump, whomanned the fry station at a McDonald’sin Pennsylvania while on the campaign trail last year, has acknowledged that the federal minimum wage is “very low” and that he would consider raising it, but that doing so would be “complicated.” Meanwhile, a growing number of states have pushed to increase their minimum wage in the face of record-high inflation in recent years. Voters in Alaska approved a ballot initiative in November that will raise the state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour from $11.73 an hour by 2027. Missouri voters likewise approved a minimum wage hike to $15 from $12.30 an hour by 2026. And California — which has one of the highest costs of living in the country — in Aprilraised wagesfor fast food workers specifically, to $20 an hour from $16 an hour.  By the end of this year, 23 states and 65 cities and counties will raise their minimum wage floors, according to a December 2024 National Employment Law Projectreportthat combed through legislation across the country.  But not Texas, where Yeldell and her family live. It isone of 20 statesat the $7.25 federal minimum wage floor and that rate hasn’t budged since 2009. Democratic lawmakers in Texas have repeatedly proposed legislation to raise the minimum wage in the state to no avail.Preemption laws, which exist in Texas and many other states, block cities and counties from adopting their own minimum wage laws, presenting another barrier. Today, a living wage for one adult raising three children in the Houston metro area is $57.65 an hour, according to MIT’s Living Wage Calculator. For Yeldell, it’s not possible to get by on her fast food job alone, which is why she must work a second job. Still wearing her visor and gray “No One Out Pizzas The Hut” shirt, she slumps sideways after a recent work shift, resting an elbow on the folding table surrounded by four folding chairs where the family eats. The living room furniture is sparse but the home is tidy. A yellow mop bucket sits near the entryway, and a small vacuum rests against the closet door. She only takes a moment to rest before changing into Looney Tunes sweatpants and a yellow T-shirt, scooping fajitas onto plates for the kids’ dinner, and packing up the leftovers. Then the teens disappear into their bedrooms, and her Minecraft pajama-clad youngest curls up next to her on the couch, playing a game on a bright red console. TiAnna Yeldell, left, spends time with her son Ivan, 8, right, at her home, Thursday, Nov. 14, 2024, in Missouri City, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)  “I don’t want to work two jobs -- I’m really tired. But I have to, because the jobs don’t pay enough,” Yeldell said. “I would not be able to provide a roof over my kids’ head … They come first, I come second.” The Associated Press reached out to Pizza Hut, as well as its parent company, Yum Brands, for comment on wages for fast food workers but did not hear back. Wages are just one of many issues fast food workers face. Unpredictable hours, limited access to paid sick leave, and challenging customer interactions all shape their experiences, said Daniel Schneider, co-director and co-founder of the Shift Project, a joint Harvard and University of California, San Francisco project researching the conditions of service sector work. Wage theft and other law violations are also common in the industry, added labor scholar David Madland, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. “The fast food industry is notorious for low pay and poor working conditions,” Madland said. “It’s seen as the almost the sort of typical throwaway job that policy has cared very little about.” Yeldell’s Pizza Hut deliveries sometimes go until 11 p.m. She carries a knife in her pocket, as well as a flashlight, to keep her safe.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)  TiAnna Yeldell works in the kitchen at Pizza Hut, Thursday, Nov. 14, 2024, in Missouri City, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)  Despite the challenges, Yeldell maintains a positive outlook about her job, which she started about a year and a half ago as a delivery driver and has since learned to do “pretty much everything” at her Fresno, Texas store, including making pizzas, prepping ingredients, and running the register. “Pizza Hut is a really easy job and the job is only hard if you make it hard,” she said. “And I’m a fast learner, so it doesn’t bother me. The only time that it’s worrisome is when we’re slow and they say, ‘Oh, we got to cut your hours.’” Contrast Texas to California, which now has the highest fast food minimum wage of any state since lawmakers passed a minimum $20 hourly wage for those workers. Angelica Hernandez, 51, who has worked at various McDonald’s restaurants for 20 years and now works for a Monterey Park location in Los Angeles County, said the raise helped her pay rent and bills on time, avoid late fees, and buy “a bit more” at the grocery store. It’s also allowed her family the chance to go out to eat on the weekends, “which I was never able to do before, so it’s a big accomplishment what fast food workers were able to win,” she said. But Hernandez says much of the increase was swallowed by a recent $200 rent hike. “We need a little more to be able to save money and buy clothes without being tight every two weeks or have to use credit,” she said. Now, Hernandez is a member of California Fast Food Workers Union, and councilmember on the state’s Fast Food Council established bythe new California lawand aimed at improving working conditions.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)  Critics ofthe lawsay continuing to increase minimum wage is not the answer, arguing that it has raised prices and reduced job opportunities for young people, pinching franchisees in an industry with already-slim margins. “When you see a spike in operating costs pretty dramatically in a short period of time, it creates challenges,” said Jot Condie, president and CEO of the California Restaurant Association, which opposed the law. He added that franchisees, who are essentially small business owners, are most harmed. But a September report from University of California, Berkeley’s Institute for Research on Labor and Employment called the effects of the new law “benign,” and found that the policy did not affect employment adversely and increased prices about 3.7%, or about 15 cents on a $4 hamburger. For Yeldell, increasing the minimum wage in Texas “would be more fair.” ”If other states could change, y’all can change too,” she said. Her exhaustion shines through: her movements are slow, and her eyelids droop. Between her two jobs, she has no days off so her activities with the kids have to happen on the days she works at one job, not both. But she makes it happen. On a chilly Friday morning at 7 a.m., she walks her youngest to the bus stop, then drives her daughter across town to have her senior pictures done before her Pizza Hut shift starts.

Both women’s hair is arranged in long, elegant braids with the ends curled. “Being a mother, I do what I’m supposed to do for my kids,” she said. But for all her hard work, Yeldell says the family has little to no savings. On good months, she says she has about $100 left over. Often, she has nothing, which leaves no room for vacations, or outings with kids. “At the end of the day, I’ve worked all these hours and I really have nothing to show for it, but just paying some bills,” she said.

Most of the region was forecast to get around an inch (about 2.5 centimeters) of precipitation over several days, but “the threat is high enough to prepare for the worst-case scenario” of localized cloudbursts causing mud and debris to flow down hills, the National Weather Service said on social media. “So the problem would be if one of those showers happens to park itself over a burn area,” weather service meteorologist Carol Smith said. “That could be enough to create debris flows.” Rainfall that began late Saturday was expected to increase Sunday and possibly last into early Tuesday, forecasters said. Flood watches were issued for some burn areas, while snow was likely in the mountains. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bassissued an executive order last weekto expedite cleanup efforts and mitigate the environmental impacts of fire-related pollutants. LA County supervisors also approved an emergency motion to install flood-control infrastructure and expedite and remove sediment in fire-impacted areas.  Fire crews filled sandbags for communities, while county workers installed barriers and cleared drainage pipes and basins. Officials cautioned that ash in recent burn zones wasa toxic mixof incinerated cars, electronics, batteries, building materials, paints, furniture and other household items. It contains pesticides, asbestos, plastics and lead. Residents were urged to wear protective gear while cleaning up. Concerns about post-fire debris flows have been especially high since 2018, when the town of Montecito, up the coast from LA, wasravaged by mudslidesafter a downpour hit mountain slopes burned bare by a huge blaze. Hundreds of homes were damaged and 23 people died. While the impending wet weather ended weeks of dangerous gusts and reduced humidity, several wildfires were still burning Saturday across Southern California. Those included the Palisades and Eaton fires, whichkilled at least 28 peopleand destroyed more than 14,000 structures. Containment of the Palisades Fire reached 81% on Saturday and the Eaton Fire was 95% contained.

In San Diego County, there was still little containment of the Border 2 Fire as it burned through a remote area of the Otay Mountain Wilderness near the U.S.-Mexico border. The rain was expected to snap a near-record streak of dry weather for Southern California. Much of the region has received less than 5% of the average rainfall for this point in the water year, which began Oct. 1, the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday. Most of Southern California is currently in “extreme drought” or “severe drought,” according to theU.S. Drought Monitor.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

        "content": "Hegseth, Noem join Trump's Cabinet after Senate confirmation. President Donald Trump took a victory lap at a Las Vegas casino on Saturday after a five days of issuing executive orders on immigration, the economy, DEI and more. Trump late Friday night stirred up outrage when he blindsided at least 17 inspectors general at multiple federal agencies by firing them in an email from the White House personnel office. Meanwhile, two more of Trump's picks for his Cabinet -- Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense and Kristi Noem as secretary of Homeland Security -- were sworn in to office on Saturday. In a post on X thus morning, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that Belarus “just unilaterally released an innocent American, ANASTASSIA Nuhfer, who was taken under JOE BIDEN!” Rubio credited Trump and Chris Welby Smith, the State Department’s deputy assistant secretary for Eastern Europe, for the release.   Nuhfer was detained in early December 2024 and visited by a consular officer about three weeks ago, a State Department spokesperson said. -ABC News' Shannon Kingston Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, the top Trump appointee in the Justice Department, is currently in Chicago to “personally observe DHS immigration enforcement operations and support the efforts of FBI, DEA, ATF, USMS, and federal prosecutors who are assisting DHS in this critical mission,” a DOJ spokesperson told ABC News. The department declined to provide any additional details about Bove’s precise location or the planned “enforcement operations” he will be overseeing.   His presence on the ground, however, further highlights how the Trump administration plans to involve the highest level officials at DOJ as part of its broader show of force on immigration enforcement. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement said in a statement Sunday that it, \"along with federal partners, including the FBI, ATF, DEA, CBP and the U.S. Marshals Service, began conducting enhanced targeted operations today in Chicago to enforce U.S. immigration law and preserve public safety and national security by keeping potentially dangerous criminal aliens out of our communities.\" -ABC News' Alexander Mallin The Coast Guard said it's helping transport migrants who are in the country illegally and who are in locations where there aren't Defense Department assets. In a Saturday news release, the Coast Guard said it is conducting flights between Texas and California to get migrants to DOD bases to be removed from the country.   \"Border czar\" Tom Homan said the Trump administration isplanning to use military aircraftevery day to help carry out large-scale deportations. For the first time ever, the U.S. government is using military aircraft to transport migrants out of the U.S., Homan said. -ABC News' Luke Barr Kristi Noem was sworn in as secretary of Homeland Security Saturday afternoon. Noem’s oath of office was scheduled around the same time as Trump's Las Vegas rally, and therefore her ceremony was delayed. -ABC News' Kelsey Walsh"

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)                 PARK CITY, Utah (AP) —Rose Byrneplays a mother in the midst of a breakdown in the experiential psychological thriller “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You.” Anticipation was high for the A24 film, which will be released sometime this year. Its premiere Friday at theSundance Film Festivalwas easily the hottest ticket in town, with even ticketholders unable to get in. Those who did make it into the Library theater were treated to an intense, visceral, inventive story from filmmaker Mary Bronstein that has quickly become one of the festival’s must-sees. Byrne plays Linda, who is barely hanging on while managing her daughter’s mysterious illness. She’s faced with crisis after crisis, big and small — from the massive, gaping hole in their apartment ceiling that forces them to move to a dingy motel, to an escalating showdown with a parking attendant at a care center. The cracks in her psychological, emotional and physical wellbeing are become too much to bear. “I’d never seen a movie before where a mother is going through a crisis with a child but our energy is not with the child’s struggle, it’s with the mother’s,” Bronstein said at the premiere. “If you’re a caretaker, you shouldn’t be bothering with yourself at all. It should all be about the person you’re taking care of, right? And that is a particular kind of emotional burnout state that I was really interested in exploring.” Byrne and Bronstein went deep in the preparation phase, having long discussions about Linda with the goal of making her as real as possible before the quick, 27-day shoot. Byrne said she was obsessed with figuring out who Linda was before the crisis. The film was in part inspired by Bronstein’s experience with her own daughter, but she didn’t want to elaborate on the specifics.  “That’s her story to tell,” Bronstein said. Part of Linda’s story involves her therapist, played byConan O’Brien, who joked that he didn’t realize he was in a movie. “I’m not looking out for movie scripts or anything. But when I got a call from A24 that they wanted me to read something, I’m not stupid,” O’Brien said. “I showed it to my wife, who is one of the smartest people I know, and she read through it and she said, ‘I didn’t know they made movies like this anymore.’” He was particularly in awe of his director and co-star, saying he felt like a fraud standing beside them. “It was an amazing experience, one of the best experiences of my life, just to be with them and watch them work,” O’Brien said. “I don’t know how (Byrne) did that and not check into a hospital afterwards, because I haven’t seen any actor, man or woman, sustain that level for an entire movie.” “I feel like I have to go to a hospital now, because this was the first time I watched it,” he added. “I’m a mess.” A$AP Rockyalso co-stars, as a man Linda meets at the motel, but was not in Park City for the premiere. He is currentlyon trial, charged with firing a gun at a former friend. The film is full of ambiguity, metaphor and just plain artistic expression that Bronstein hesitated to explain, from the name itself to the hole in the ceiling, which takes on a somewhat supernatural quality. “When we have nothing left to give, we have an emptiness inside of us,” Bronstein said. “And that emptiness is actually not empty: It’s filled with all the darkness and self-hate and doubt and fear and dread and regret and everything. … That to me is what the hole is.” Some of it, she said, she doesn’t even fully understand. The point is the experience, and critics and Sundance audiences are already fully on board. Bronstein, a bit of a cult figure in the film world, made her directorial debut in 2008 at the SXSW festival with “Yeast,” which featured a pre-fame Greta Gerwig and was hailed by by New Yorker critic Richard Brody as a “mumblecore classic.” “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” is only her second feature. “This is the first time that anybody else has paid for me to make art,” Bronstein said. “I’m proud to say that this is the film that came directly from my head to the screen.” For more coverage of the 2025 Sundance Film Festival, visit:https://apnews.com/hub/sundance-film-festival   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

In an interview with AP entertainment journalist Krysta Fauria, the pair discussed working with an intimacy coordinator, Luca Guadagnino’s directing style — and the legacy of Beat Generation writer and “Queer” author William S. Burroughs.  Country music comes naturally to Ringo Starr. The former Beatle has dabbled in the music ever since singing the country hit “Act Naturally” with the Beatles in 1965, and he’s now about to release a whole country album. Starr says in an interview with The Associated Press’ Andrew Dalton that he’s put a bit of country in most everything he’s done, so the album wasn’t too big a stretch. Starr says the project began when he bumped into his friend, classic country aficionado T-Bone Burnett, and asked him to write a song. Burnett came back with nine. The resulting album, “Look Up,” comes out in January.  Erykah Badu has been a music disruptor, culture shifter and style maven ever since she stepping into the limelight with her 1997 debut album, “Baduizm.” The four-time Grammy winner, who was recently honored with the CFDA (Council of Fashion Designers of America) Icon award, sat down with AP entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton to talk about her fashion influence, working on new music, her appearance in “The Piano Lesson” —and finally learning to stop and smell the flowers.

Rama Rao Jr. is following up the international success of “RRR” with the action-drama “Devara: Part 1,” in which he plays both a mythical hero and a son struggling with his dad’s legacy.

The 41-year-old, whose father and grandfather were both prominent actors and political leaders, sat down with AP entertainment editor Ryan Pearson to talk about his own perspective on fatherhood, filming crowd-pleasing underwater scenes, staying “innocent” as an actor — and his love for the Will Smith film “The Pursuit of Happiness.”  RZA’s hoarding habit led to his newest adventure in music: a ballet and surprisingly traditional classical music album he calls “A Ballet Through Mud.” He sat down with AP entertainment editor Ryan Pearson to talk about the nostalgic genesis of the project, the growing bridge between the worlds of classical and hip-hop, and his hopes for what happens next with his composition and ballet.  After releasing 18 albums over more than two decades, Xiu Xiu is still making music for outsiders. With the release of “13'’ Frank Beltrame Italian Stiletto with Bison Horn Grips,” band leader Jamie Stewart spoke with AP entertainment journalist Krysta Fauria about balancing harmony and dissonance, moving to Berlin — and why the band “wouldn’t exist” without David Lynch’s “Twin Peaks” universe.

She sat down with AP film writer Lindsey Bahr to talk about creating a new voice for her Lee/Harley Quinn character, writing a “waltz that falls apart” for the film — and why it’s an “exciting time” in pop music.

They sat down with AP entertainment editor Louise Dixon at the Venice Film Festival to discuss how Jolie connected with Callas, the difficulty of performing opera — and why the film, to be released on Netflix, is the most personal of Larraín’s biopic trilogy that includes “Spencer” and “Jackie.”  Nearly a decade after his last full-length release, Zedd is releasing “Telos.” The Grammy-winning producer/DJ says he needed to push himself to make an album that would move the needle — one that told a story beyond the success of his debut LP, “Clarity,” or “True Colors.” The German dance-pop maverick says the album — which features collaborators ranging from Muse and John Mayer to Remi Wolf and Bea Miller — is “an album that for many years I doubted I could create.” He spoke with AP entertainment journalist Rick Taber about the long process of creating “Telos,” being inspired by Jeff Buckley and the state of EDM.  “Only Murders in the Building” has become a “safe place” for Selena Gomez as the hit Hulu comedy enters its fourth season.

The 72-year-old star sat down with AP entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton to talk about why he was nervous to return for the sequel featuring Jenna Ortega and Winona Ryder, the impact of Tim Burton’s original 1988 horror comedy — and why he never thought of himself as playing Batman.  Justin Baldoni’s “It Ends With Us” journey began well before Colleen Hoover’s novel became a sensation on TikTok. The 40-year-old actor and filmmaker optioned the book in 2019 while he was shooting “Jane The Virgin” and preparing to release his feature film directorial debut, “Five Feet Apart.” Five years later, he spoke with AP entertainment journalist Alicia Rancilio about directing and co-starring alongside Blake Lively in the drama that revolves around domestic violence.

Josh Hartnett is looking back at shedding his Hollywood heartthrob image in the 2000s as he stars in M. Night Shyamalan’s thriller “Trap.” Hartnett is now 46 and lives in England with his wife and four children. While he’s been working steadily since breaking out in 1998 with a “Halloween” sequel and “The Faculty,” he intentionally moved away from studio movies and leading man roles after being typecast as his fame grew with movies like “Black Hawk Down” and “Pearl Harbor.” In “Trap,” Hartnett plays a father with a secret who takes his daughter to a pop concert — which is surrounded by police searching for a serial killer.  M. Night Shyamalan has been at least partly self-financing his films since 2015’s “The Visit,” risking his own money on box office success. His latest is “Trap,” starring Josh Hartnett as a father with a secret and Shyamalan’s daughter Saleka as a pop star whose concert is surrounded by police looking to capture a serial killer. Shyamalan spoke with AP entertainment editor Ryan Pearson about his high-risk, high-reward, lower-budget filmmaking approach, guiding his daughters’ artistic pursuits — and his philosophy that “talent is process.”  Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

        "content": "Since June 1, 2024, Los Angeles has only picked up 0.03 inches of rainfall. Rain was falling across Southern California on Sunday, bringing some relief to thousands of firefighters battling multiplemajor blazesfor nearly a month in the Los Angeles area, but also prompting new threats of floods and mudslides across burn-scarred lands. A flood watch issued by the National Weather Service is to go into effect at 10 a.m. local time on Sunday for fire-ravaged areas of Los Angeles County, which has been ground zero for the historic firestorms that have leveled thousands of homes and killed at least 28 people since first igniting on Jan. 7. The flood watch will remain in effect until Monday afternoon in burn-scarred areas left by the Eaton, Palisades, Franklin, Bridge and Hughes fires. The rain is forecast to be widespread but is expected to be light enough to avoid major flooding. But if a downpour spends enough time over one of the recent burn scars, a debris flow could become an issue. Rain totals from the storm will mostly range from a half-inch to an inch, allowing for a decent soaking for the first time in months. Since June 1, Los Angeles has only picked up 0.03 inches of rainfall, which has allowed an extreme drought to develop across the area for the first time in two years. In addition to rain, higher elevations of Southern California, including the San Gabriel Mountains straddling northern Los Angeles and western San Bernardino counties, are expecting snow, with areas above 4,000 feet getting up to 14 inches of powder. The rain and snow forecast comes as firefighters continued to battle five active fires on Sunday from Ventura County north of Los Angeles to the Mexican border south of San Diego. The Palisades Fire, which ignited on Jan. 7 in Los Angeles County's Pacific Palisades, was 84% contained as of Sunday after burning more than 23,000 acres, destroying nearly 7,000 structures and killing 11 people, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). The Eaton Fire, which also broke out on Jan. 7 in Pasadena and Altadena, was 95% contained on Sunday after burning more than 14,000 acres, destroying more than 9,400 structures and killing 17 people. Other fires still active on Sunday, according to Cal Fire, include the Hughes Fire near Castaic Lake, about 45 miles north of downtown Los Angeles, which was 90% contained after starting on Wednesday and burning more than 10,000 acres of brush land; the Border 2 Fire that broke out Thursday near the San Diego-Mexico border and is 10% contained after burning more than 6,600 acres of wilderness land; and the Laguna Fire, which also started Thursday in Camarillo in Ventura County, which was 98% contained on Sunday after charring 83 acres and prompting a brief evacuation of the California State University Channel Islands. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(Andrew Esola via AP)             ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — North America’s tallest peak is a focal point of Jeff King’s life. The four-time winner of the 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometer) Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race operates his kennel and mushing tourism business just 8 miles (12.87 kilometers) fromDenali National Park and Preserve’s entrance, and the 20,310-foot (6,190-meter) mountain looms large as he trains his dogs on nearby trails. King and many others who live in the mountain’s shadow say most Alaskans will never stop calling the peak Denali,its Alaska Native name, despitePresident Donald Trump’s executive orderthat the namerevert to Mount McKinley-- an identifier inspired byPresident William McKinley, who was from Ohio and never set foot in Alaska. For many who live near Denali, Trump’s suggestion was peculiar. “I don’t know a single person that likes the idea, and we’re pretty vocal about it,” King said. “Denali respects the Indigenous people that have been here and around Denali for tens of thousands of years.” The mountain was named after McKinleywhen a prospector walked out of the Alaska wildernessin 1896, and the first news he heard was that the Republican had been nominated for president. The name was quickly challenged, but maps had already been circulated with the mountain’s name in place. At the time, there was no recognition of the name Denali, or “the high one,” bestowed on the mountain in interior Alaska by Athabascan tribal members, who have lived in the region for centuries.  The McKinley name stuck until 2015, whenPresident Barack Obama’s administrationchanged it to Denali as a symbolic gesture to Alaska Natives on the eve of his Alaska visit tohighlight climate change. Trump said he issued the order to “restore the name of a great president, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs. President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent.” The area lies solely in the United States, and Trump, as president, has the authority to change federal geographical names within the country. In Ohio, Trump’s move drew praise. “I was really excited to see President Trump do that executive order,” former U.S. Rep. Bob Gibbs, R-Ohio, told The Associated Press by telephone Thursday. McKinley “was a great president,” Gibbs said. “It was the appropriate thing to do.” That’s not how Alaskans see it. Trump injected “a jarring note” into Alaska affairs, Steve Haycox, professor emeritus of history at the University of Alaska Anchorage, wrote inthe Anchorage Daily News. “Historical analysis confirms that William McKinley is the wrong public figure for Alaskans to commemorate,” he said. McKinley served as president from 1897 until he was assassinated in 1901. He was an imperial colonialist who oversaw the expansion of the American empire with the occupation of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Philippines andHawaii, pushed by business interests and Christian missionaries wanting to convert Indigenous peoples, Haycox said. “Trump’s push to rescind the name Denali for the colonialist and white elitist McKinley is insulting to all Alaskans, especially to Alaska’s Native people, and should be soundly rejected,” Haycox said. John Wayne Howe, who unsuccessfully ran for U.S. House last year representing the Alaskan Independence Party, which holds that Alaskans should be allowed to vote on becoming an independent nation, said he is tired of “people changing the names of stuff, period.” He also is not in favor of naming anything after people because “the persons that we consider absolutely perfect change over time, and it just leads to confusion.” Howe said he prefers Denali because he knows McKinley’s history and it’s the name most preferred by Alaskans. This past week, two resolutions were introduced in the Alaska Legislature to keep the name Denali. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Trump ally who praised another order by the president aimed at spurring resource development in the state, said he had not had a chance to speak with Trump about the issue but hoped to have a conversation next month in Washington about what Denali means to Alaskans, Americans and “our Native folks.” But Sarah Palin, a former Republican governor who is also a Trump supporter, said the McKinley name should never have been removed. Palin’s Secret Service code name was Denali in 2008 when she was GOP presidential nominee John McCain’s running mate the year they lost to Obama and Joe Biden. But in an interview with Al Arabiya News this past week, Palin said she didn’t see why the mountain’s name needed to be changed to begin with. “It’s always been Mount McKinley,” said Palin, who didn’t respond to a message from The Associated Press. “Nobody was begging for a change in name in that peak. Just put it back the way it was, more common sense.” Alaska’s U.S. senators, Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, have supported the name Denali. U.S. Rep. Nick Begich, a first-term Republican, sidestepped the debate. “I’m focused on job creation, opportunities in Alaska,” Begich told Politico. “And what we call a mountain in Alaska is of little concern to me.” The Alaska Native Heritage Center, the statewide Indigenous cultural center in Anchorage, supports preserving Indigenous place names. “Restoring and honoring them acknowledges the deep, millennia-old connection Indigenous peoples maintain with these lands and is a step toward respect and reconciliation,” the center’s president, Emily Edenshaw, said in a statement. The quirky Alaska community of Talkeetna, about 140 miles (225.3 kilometers) south of the park and wherea cat was once mayor, is the jumping off point for climbers before making the ascent of the peak. The historic community long rumored to be the inspiration for the 1990s television series “Northern Exposure” is also a popular tourist stop. Joe McAneney of Talkeetna worked as a summer raft-guide for two years before moving to Alaska full time in 2012. He’s now a pilot for an air taxi company, ferrying climbers and tourists to the mountain in a small airplane outfitted with skis to land atbase camp, located on Kahiltna Glacierat 7,200 feet (2,194.6 meters) above sea level. He knows once tourist season comes around, he will have to answer their questions of what he thinks about Trump changing the name. He knows what his answer will be. “It’s always been Denali, and it always will be,” he said. The executive order can instigate the name change, but compliance is another issue. “The only people that are going to adhere to that are probably the people that would have been still calling it McKinley anyway,” McAneney said There is a long-standing Alaska trait of ignoring what the rest of the world thinks, and it’s usually expressed like this: “We don’t care how they do it Outside.” Outside, which is always capitalized, refers to every place that is not Alaska. “I think unofficially and officially in Alaska, it’ll always be Denali,” McAneney said. “I don’t think the president can change that.” For King, the decorated Iditarod musher and fan favorite, Trump’s decision had a whiff of arrogance. “I’m surprised he doesn’t want to name it Trump Mountain,” he said.

        "content": "Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote Friday. Pete Hegseth was sworn in to lead the Department of Defense on Saturday, after a narrow vote in the Senate. The vote on Friday night was initially 50-50, with Vice President JD Vance then casting the tie-breaking vote. Former GOP leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, voted no. He joined Sens. Susan Collins, of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, along with all Democrats in voting against Hegseth's nomination. The former Fox News host was sworn in at the White House on Saturday morning during a ceremony officiated by Vance. \"We look forward to having the backs of our troops and having your back in executing peace through strength, in putting America first. And in rebuilding our military,” Hegseth said in remarks at the ceremony, thanking Vance and President Donald Trump. In an official statement to the department, he said: \"It is the privilege of a lifetime to lead the warriors of the Department of Defense, under the leadership of our Commander in Chief Donald J. Trump. We will put America First, and we will never back down.\" Hegseth, a former\"Fox and Friends\" television anchor, was nominated by Trump in November to lead the Defense Department. In the time since his nomination was announced, Hegseth has beenscrutinized for a number of accusationsmade against him, including those of sexual assault and financial mismanagement of two different veterans organizations. Hegseth has fiercely deniedthe allegations. He appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee for a public hearing earlier this month, where he asserted to the panel that he was a \"changed man.\" \"I am not a perfect person, but redemption is real,\" he told the panel. Speaking to reporters while on a visit to Los Angeles, Trump said he was \"very happy\" with the vote, and said he was not aware of McConnell's vote. In a statement released while the vote was still going on, McConnell said that Hegseth's desire to be a \"change agent\" was not enough to qualify him for the role of secretary of defense. \"Effective management of nearly 3 million military and civilian personnel, an annual budget of nearly $1 trillion, and alliances and partnerships around the world is a daily test with staggering consequences for the security of the American people and our global interests,\" McConnell said in the statement. \"Mr. Hegseth has failed, as yet, to demonstrate that he will pass this test. But as he assumes office, the consequences of failure are as high as they have ever been.\" Hegseth was confirmed by one of the narrowest Senate margins of any defense secretary in modern history. Most defense secretaries have been confirmed with broad bipartisan votes. Lloyd Austin, former President Joe Biden's pick for defense secretary, was confirmed in a93-2 voteand Trump's first pick for defense secretary in his first term, James Mattis, was confirmed in a98-1 vote. Before the vote, Hegseth arrived at the Capitol with his wife and children to watch the proceedings in person, a rare move for a Cabinet nominee. With the Senate's vote Friday, Hegseth becomes the third member of Trump's team to be confirmed by the Senate, following Marco Rubio as secretary of state and John Ratcliffe, as CIA director. During the same hearing, he affirmed his promise to restore the \"warfighting ethos\" of the DOD, touting his experience in the National Guard. It was enough to win over the support of most Republicans in the Senate, including several of those who were initially skeptical. \"He articulated a clear vision of the Pentagon, and it was clear to anyone who listened that he is going to bring energy and fresh ideas to shake up the department's stagnant bureaucracy,\" Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a floor speech endorsing Hegseth on Thursday. \"He will restore a warfighting ethos and relentlessly focused on the military's core mission: to deter conflict and, if necessary, to win a war.\" The Senate Armed Services Committee advanced his nomination on a party-line vote on Monday. Then, in a closely watched moment on Thursday, Hegseth's nomination passed a key test vote that set the table for Friday's vote of final passage. The nomination only required a simple majority in the Senate to advance, and it cleared the threshold narrowly, with only GOP backing. Collins and Murkowski also voted no on that occasion. In a statement, Murkowski explained that she could not support Hegseth due to concerns about this character and lack of experience. \"I believe that character is the defining trait required of the Secretary of Defense and must be prioritized without compromise,\" Murkowski said in the post. \"The leader of the Department of Defense must demonstrate and model the standards of behavior and character we expect of all servicemembers, and Mr. Hegseth's nomination to the role poses significant concerns that I cannot overlook.\" Collins took issue with comments Hegseth made in the past about his belief that women should not serve in combat roles in the military. Though Hegseth has since changed his tune on that, Collins said she was unconvinced. \"I am also concerned about multiple statements, including some in the months just before he was nominated, that Mr. Hegseth has made about women serving in the military,\" Collins said. \"He and I had a candid conversation in December about his past statements and apparently evolving views. I am not convinced that his position on women serving in combat roles has changed.\" Trump expressed confidence in Hegseth ahead of the vote on Friday, though he added, \"You'll never know what's going to happen.\" McConnell, the former GOP leader, and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, ultimately cast votes in favor of advancing Hegseth's nomination in the earlier test vote, although the presidentquestioned whether McConnell will vote noon Hegseth Friday morning. Tillis said he was still considering the most recent slate of allegations against Hegseth, leveled in an affidavit from his former sister-in-law Danielle Hegseth. In that affidavit,which ABC News obtained, Danielle Hegseth attested that Pete Hegseth's ex-wife Samantha told her she \"once hid in her closet from him because she feared for her personal safety\" in the home they shared during their marriage. It also detailed episodes of binge drinking by Pete Hegseth. An attorney for Pete Hegseth denied these allegations, and the claims of abuse were also rejected by his ex-wife. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "content": "Homan says administration has a “clear” message for undocumented immigrants. For the first time in U.S. history, military aircraft were used this past week to deport scores of undocumented migrants from the United States. Middle schools, Trump administration officials say, are now seen as places to target for immigration enforcement operations. And, according to President Trump's \"border czar,\" every undocumented immigrant should worry they could be arrested at any time, even if they have no criminal record. The \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, says it's all part of the Trump administration's effort to send a \"clear\" message: \"There's consequences [for] entering the country illegally,\" he told ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz on Sunday. \"If we don't show there's consequences, you're never going to fix the border problem,\" he said. More than 11 million undocumented immigrants are currently estimated to be living in the U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to take unprecedented action to remove as many of them as possible and stem the flow of more migrants coming to the southern border. In his first several days in office, Trump declared a national emergency at the border, announced an end to the so-called practice of \"catch and release\" -- when migrants claiming asylum are given court dates and then released pending those proceedings -- and sought to overturn the long-held Constitutional right of birthright citizenship, a move that immediately faced legal challenges and was at least temporarily blocked by a federal judge. As for the millions of undocumented immigrants already in the country, Homan said the administration will deport \"as many as we can,\" starting with threats to public safety threats and national security, Homan said. According to estimates released by House Republicans last year, based on government data, hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants in the country are convicted criminals or have charges pending against them. Government statistics indicate that in the past four years, hundreds of migrants were caught along the southern border with names matching known or suspected terrorists on a government watchlist. And Homan has said more than 2 million people were detected along the border but never captured, so authorities don't know who they are or what threat some of them could pose. According to statistics released by the Department of Homeland Security last year, a tiny fraction of those who reached U.S. borders in the prior three years had any kind of criminal record, and the vast majority of them involved nonviolent crimes, such as driving under the influence or previously entering the country illegally. Homan told ABC News that the Trump administration is only \"in the beginning stages\" of carrying out its mass deportation plan, making public safety threats and national security threats a \"priority,\" but \"as that aperture opens, there'll be more arrests nationwide.\" And he warned that there will be \"collateral arrests,\" especially in the so-called \"sanctuary cities\" that he says are resistant to helpingImmigrationand Customs Enforcement officials locate and arrest undocumented immigrants already in local custody for other crimes. \"Sanctuary cities lock us out of the jails,\" said Homan, who led ICE as acting director in Trump's first administration. According to Homan, that creates significant safety concerns: When an undocumented immigrant arrested for a serious crime is released by local authorities, instead of being deported, it \"endangers the community.\" Nevertheless, Homan said that's a time when ICE officers would likely make \"collateral arrests.\" \"When we find him, he's going to be with others … [and] if they're in the country illegally, they're coming too,\" he said. He emphasized that anyone in the country unlawfully is \"on the table.\" \"It's not OK to violate the laws of this country,\" he said. \"We have millions of people standing in line, taking the test, doing their background investigation, paying the fees that want to come in the right way.\" \"So if you're in the country illegally, you got a problem,\" he said. On Monday, during Trump's first day in office, acting Homeland Security Secretary Benjamine Huffman issued a directive telling immigration authorities they could conduct operations in so-called \"sensitive\" areas that he said were off-limits during the Biden administration. \"Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America's schools and churches to avoid arrest,\" he said in a statement. Others, however, said the administration was simply creating fear within the immigrant community, with the chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on Migration saying that \"turning places of care, healing and solace into places of fear and uncertainty … will note make our communities safer. He said that as they prioritize national security threats and public safety threats, ICE officers might have to even go into schools because \"many\" members of gangs tied to South and Central America, such as MS-13, are between 14 and 17 years old. In his interview with ABC News, Homan said that no other law enforcement agency is restricted from entering certain locations to promote public safety in the same way ICE has been. \"Name another agency, another law enforcement agency, that has those type of requirements, that they can't walk into a school or doctor's office or a medical campus,\" he said. \"No other agency is held to those standards.\" \"These are well-trained [ICE] officers with a lot of discretion, and when it comes to a sensitive location, there's still going to be supervisory review,\" he said. \"But ICE officers should have discretion to decide if a national security threat or a public safety threat [is] in one of these facilities.\" Homan said anyone already in the country unlawfully \"should leave,\" and those looking to claim asylum should \"do it the legal way.\" \"Go to the embassy, go to the point of entry,\" he said. \"You shouldn't come to this country and ask to get asylum and the first thing you do is break our laws by entering illegally.\" In the meantime, Homan said the Trump administration is using not just the military but the \"whole\" government, including the Justice Department, to support its mass deportation plan, which allows ICE officers to concentrate on conducting enforcement operations. But Homan acknowledged that the federal government won't be able to remove every undocumented immigrant in the U.S., and that his \"success is going to be based on what Congress gives us.\" ICE doesn't currently have enough funding from Congress to detain all of the undocumented immigrants that the Trump administration says it hopes to arrest. \"I'm being realistic,\" he said. \"We can do what we can with the money we have. We're going to try to be efficient. But with more money we have, the more we can accomplish.\" \"What price [do] you put on national security?\" he added. \"When you … don't secure that border, that's when national security threats enter the country. That's when sex trafficking goes up. That's when, you know, that's when the fentanyl comes in.\" As for what success practically looks like at the end of the Trump administration, Homan said: \"Our success every day is taking a public safety threat off the streets or getting a national security threat out of here.\" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)           DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — From activists on the far right toElon Musk, allies of PresidentDonald Trumphave been quick to threaten primary challengers for Republican senators who don’t back hisCabinet picksand legislative priorities. In the case of Iowa’s Joni Ernst, conservatives threatened to run against her if she didn’t backTrump’s pick for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth— before she announced she would. Louisiana’s Bill Cassidy, a doctor before entering politics, is being closely watched for how he will questionRobert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s nominee for health secretary South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham, a Trump confidant, has long been targeted by the far right in his state and was booed at a home-state rally during the 2024 presidential campaign. The Associated Press talked to people connected to five senators who have been targeted online or by rivals in their states. Here’s a look at each of their potential races and what they face: Ernst prompted criticism from the right after she initially stopped short of endorsing Hegseth, who wasconfirmed by the Senateon Friday. Ernst voted “yes.” A retired Iowa National Guard lieutenant colonel and Iraq War veteran, Ernst is also a sexual assault survivor. After Trump announced Hegseth’s nomination, she said she hoped to discuss with him comments that he had made opposing women serving in combat roles, and about an allegation, which he denied and was not charged for, that he sexually assaulted a woman he met at a 2017 conference.  Hegseth, at Ernst’s suggestion, affirmed that that “every man and woman has opportunity to serve their country in uniform and to do so at any level as long as they are meeting the standards that are set forward.” Hegseth also said that if confirmed, he would appoint a senior-level official dedicated to sexual assault prevention and response. Potential challengers to Ernst: Conservative media figure Steve Deace, who posted on Facebook in December that “I don’t want to be a Senator, but I am willing to primary her for the good of the cause.” Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird wrote in a December opinion piece in Breitbart that some unnamed “D.C. politicians” thought “they can ignore the voices of their constituents and entertain smears” from news media outlets. That prompted speculation that Bird, who endorsed Trump before the 2024 Iowa caucuses, might challenge Ernst, who stayed neutral beforehand. Charlie Kirk of the conservative group Turning Point also called for Ernst to face a primary. An effort to boost Hegseth’s nomination led to Ernst’s office receiving thousands of calls. Cause for concern: Neither Deace nor Bird has taken any public steps toward running. Some prominent social conservatives are bothered by Ernst’s joining with a dozen Republicans and the Senate’s Democratic majority in 2022 to support repealing the Defense of Marriage Act to recognize the validity of same-sex marriages. But she remains popular with Iowa’s power players. “Anyone who says with a straight face that they are going to beat Joni Ernst in a primary today is kidding themselves,” said Luke Martz, an Iowa Republican consultant. “It would be a fool’s errand.” Tillis angered some on the right for not immediately supporting Trump’s first pick for attorney general, former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz. Though Gaetz withdrew from consideration, Tillis remains a frustration to some among North Carolina’s right wing, in part for voting to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act. Potential challengers: Andy Nilsson, a onetime candidate for lieutenant governor, has filed paperwork to challenge Tillis. The retired businessman has called for a return to the Reagan-Bush Republican ethos, hardly an attack from the right. Tillis faced three Republican challengers in 2020, all posing as more conservative than him. Cause for concern: Tillis has reason to expect a right-wing challenge. That faction helped lift former Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson to the 2024 nomination for governor last year. But North Carolina is expected to be among the most competitive states for Senate Republicans to hold in 2026. Roy Cooper, a Democrat who just finished two terms as governor, has not ruled out running for the seat. National Republicans are aware of the risks of nominating someone too far to the right. Cooper’s Democratic successor, Gov. Josh Stein, beat Robinson by nearly 15 percentage points in a state that Trump won by 3 points. To that end, Trump’s team and Tillis have been working together behind the scenes, said former Gov. Pat McCrory, a fellow Republican. “I anticipate there will be threats of challenging him from the right. But I also think he’ll deal with it as he has, with hard work and a record of accomplishment,” McCrory said. “I think the incoming administration sees that.” “They also see he’s the best chance of keeping North Carolina red,” he added. Cassidy remains vulnerable in large part due to his vote to convict Trump after his second impeachment over the siege of the U.S. Capitol. “Our Constitution and our country is more important than any one person. I voted to convict President Trump because he is guilty,” Cassidy said in a statement after the February 2021 vote. Cassidy, in his second term, has not yet announced whether he will seek a third. A gastroenterologist before he entered politics, Cassidy will be closely watched for how he votes on Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic who has questioned medical consensus on several issues. Potential challengers: Cassidy has already drawn a Republican challenger, state Treasurer John Fleming. Fleming, a former U.S. House member from northern Louisiana, has said Cassidy’s impeachment vote “failed” Louisiana. Former U.S. Rep. Garrett Graves of Baton Rouge is also a potential challenger, as is Blake Miguez, a state senator from New Iberia. Louisiana last year did away with its 50-year tradition of “jungle primaries,” where candidates from all parties ran in the same contest in November. Cassidy would now run in a closed Republican primary that might be more difficult if he faces one strong Trump-aligned challenger. Cause for concern: Cassidy’s vote to convict Trump remains a sticking point for Republicans in a state the president won with 60% last year. But Cassidy is viewed as having strong constituent relations and visibility in the state, political observers say. “Aside from that vote, I think he’s considered a good senator, and good at constituent work,” said Ellen Carmichael, a Louisiana Republican consultant and president of Washington-based Lafayette Company. “The base is unhappy with the vote he cast. But I wouldn’t count him out.” Cornyn in the past has been criticized within his own party for being too willing to work with Democrats and has drawn boos at GOP conventions in Texas. Commentator Tucker Carlson and others have urged a primary challenge against him. Last year, Cornyn told the Dallas Morning News that, “God willing,” he would seek reelection in 2026. According to federal filings, Cornyn had more than $3.5 million on hand in toward the end of 2024. Potential challengers: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is one of the state’s most powerful Republicans and also suggested Cornyn should be primaried. Paxton was acquitted in a 2023 impeachment effort and fraud charges against him were dropped last year. Cornyn and Paxton have sniped at each other on X, with Paxton calling Cornyn “anti-Trump” and “anti-gun” and the senator firing back, “Hard to run from prison, Ken.” Cause for concern: Brendan Steinhauser, a Republican strategist who has worked on Cornyn’s previous campaigns, noted that the senator remains undefeated in elections. “He’s never taken a race for granted. I would expect him to work extremely hard and crisscross the state of Texas to earn every vote possible in this upcoming election, assuming he has a primary challenger,” Steinhauser said. “I think it’s important for him to show the ways that he has worked with President Trump to enact the conservative America First agenda, and I would expect that would be a big part of his campaign message in a potential upcoming primary.” Seeking his fifth term, Graham will likely face primary challenges — he always has. County-level Republican parties have censured him a number of times for his willingness to work on bipartisan deals. One such measure derided Graham’s “condescending attitude” to the party’s grassroots organizers. He has even drawn boos at some events of the party faithful in his home state. That includes aJuly 2023 Trump rallyin Pickens — in the county where Graham grew up — where objections from the crowd drowned out more than five minutes of his remarks. When he took the stage, Trump also elicited boos when he mentioned Graham’s name. Graham has named a campaign leadership team, which says he has more than $15 million on hand, including nearly $1 million raised in the final quarter of 2024. Potential challengers: Rep. Ralph Norman represents South Carolina’s 5th Congressional District south of Charlotte, North Carolina, and is a member of the House Freedom Caucus. Another possible opponent could be Adam Morgan, a former South Carolina legislator who lost a primary bid last year against another congressman, Rep. William Timmons. Cause for concern: While he was highly critical of Trump in 2016 when they competed for the Republican nomination, Graham has backed Trump ever since his first administration, frequently serving as his golf partner and Capitol Hill surrogate. Trump has backed him in turn. When the crowd in Pickens booed Graham’s name, Trump said he was “going to have to work on these people” and added that Graham is “there when you need him.” Kinnard reported from Washington.

(AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi)       Ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon appeared at risk on Sunday as disputes continued over key deadlines, and local health officials said that Israeli forces opened fire on both fronts. In Gaza,Israel accused Hamasof violating the ceasefire there by changing the order of hostages it has released. Citing that, Israel has stopped thousands of Palestinians from returning to the northern part ofthe Gaza Stripas expected by Sunday. Local health officials said that Israeli forces fired on the crowd, killing two. Israel said civilian hostage Arbel Yehoud should have been releasedbefore the four soldiers freed on Saturday. Mediators the United States, Qatar and Egypt were working on the issue. In Lebanon, health officials said thatIsraeli forces opened fireon protesters in the south who demanded that Israel withdraw in line with the ceasefire agreement, killing at least 22. Separately, officials with Hamas and Jordan rejected U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion that most of Gaza’s populationshould be at least temporarily resettled elsewhere, including in Egypt and Jordan. The war in Gaza broke out after Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people in southern Israel in an attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and abducted around 250. Israel’s retaliatory military operation has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of thevictims childrenand women, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians. Here is the latest: RAMALLAH, West Bank — The office of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has sharply condemned U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion to “clean out” the Gaza Strip and request that Egypt and Jordan take in more Palestinians. In a statement, the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited control over parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, says the prospect of mass displacement from the Gaza Strip “constitutes a violation of the red lines that we have repeatedly warned against.” “Our people will not leave,” the statement said. “We warn of the repercussions of such a dangerous Israeli policy that contributes to severing the ties of the Gaza Strip, and displacing its people, which will lead to destabilization and security.” Trump’s remarks suggesting that Palestinians be encouraged to leave Gaza gets at the core of Palestinian fears that they will be driven from their remaining homeland. The Palestinian presidency said it was “ready to assume its full duties in the Gaza Strip” in hopes of eventually establishing an independent Palestinian state. The Palestinian Authority, based in the West Bank city of Ramallah, briefly controlled Gaza after Israeli troops withdrew in 2005, only to be driven out by its rival Hamas two years later. PARIS — France will consider allowing Israeli companies to participate in the Paris Air Show in June, thanks to ceasefire agreements in Gaza and Lebanon, the French president’s office said Sunday. That was among the results of a conversation Sunday between French President Emmanuel Macron and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Macron said France hopes to help speed up the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza, two of whom are French citizens. Macron also urged Israel to allow for a ″massive″ facilitation of aid to Gaza’s population, and to fulfill its promises to withdraw troops from Lebanon under a truce brokered by the U.S. and France. Netanyahu asked about Israeli participation in the upcoming Paris Air Show at Le Bourget, a major industry event. The French president said Israeli participation ″could be favorably considered, as a consequence of the cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon,″ according to Macron’s office. Tensions surrounded Israel’s participation in twoarms shows in Francelast year, Eurosatory and Euronaval. The French government did not want Israel displaying any weapons used in its wars in Gaza and Lebanon. RAMALLAH, West Bank — A spokesman for the Islamic Jihad, Gaza’s second-largest militant group, says the dispute over an Israeli hostage that has kept Palestinians from returning home to northern Gaza has been settled. Mohamed al-Hajj Mousa added in a statement that the group told mediators that the hostage, Arbel Yehoud, will be released before Saturday, when the next exchange of hostages from Gaza for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody is set to take place. There is no immediate comment from Israel, which has accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire by changing the order of hostages it has released. It expected Yehoud to be freed this weekend, and it has put the movement of Palestinians into northern Gaza on hold. RAMALLAH, West Bank — The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees says that if Israel carries out its threat to close its east Jerusalem headquarters on Thursday, the outsize effects will be felt acutely and immediately by tens of thousands of Palestinians. The agency, known as UNRWA, runs 12 facilities that provide critical public services across east Jerusalem, including schools enrolling at least 1,200 children and free clinics serving over 70,000 people. “That’s the thing, it has an impact on people’s lives,” Juliette Touma, a spokeswoman for UNRWA, said of the potential closure. In the Shuafat refugee camp, an impoverished neighborhood, “people today can walk just a few meters and they’re in an excellent clinic,” Touma said. But if it’s shuttered, she said, tens of thousands of Palestinians would have to cross a difficult checkpoint, pay for transport and, even if they’re eligible for Israeli primary health care, also pay for medicine in order to see a doctor or get a blood test. “We’re talking about the poorest of the poor,” Touma said. “Right now, they have no alternative.” The closure of UNRWA schools would raise all sorts of problems given that there are already too few classrooms in the overcrowded Palestinian areas of east Jerusalem, she said. Touma said much remains unclear about the Israeli order, including whether the closure would apply to operations in east Jerusalem only or to the entirety of the Palestinian territories. Israel says the agency has allowed itself to be infiltrated by Hamas, allegations denied by the U.N. TEL AVIV, Israel — Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and former National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, both want Israel to establish Jewish settlements in Gaza, supported Trump’s remarks, calling it “voluntary emigration.” Palestinians and many of their supporters view it as code for ethnic cleansing. In a post on X Sunday, Smotrich called the idea of “helping (Palestinians) find other places to start new, good lives” great and said he would work with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to that end. Ben-Gvir, who quit Netanyahu’s government over the current ceasefire in Gaza, said Trump’s remarks gave Israel the green light to move ahead on “voluntary emigration.” “When the president of the world’s largest superpower brings it up himself, the government of Israel should implement it,” he said in a statement. Netanyahu has said building Jewish settlements in Gaza is not realistic. Israel withdrew troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but maintains a blockade with Egypt on the territory. JERUSALEM — The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees says its staff was directed to vacate the premises by Thursday. Israelpassed legislation last yearcutting all ties with the agency and barring it from operating in its territory. It says the agency, which is the main provider of aid in the Gaza Strip, has allowed itself to be infiltrated by Hamas, allegations denied by the U.N. In a statement Sunday, the agency, known as UNRWA, said the order to vacate “is in contradiction to international law obligations of U.N. member states,” including Israel. “United Nations premises are inviolable and enjoy privileges and immunities under the United Nations Charter.” UNRWA closed its east Jerusalem headquarters last May after Israeli protesters set fire to its perimeter. DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Bassem Naim said that “even if seemingly well-intentioned under the guise of reconstruction,” the Palestinian people will never agree to such a proposal. He also said the Palestinians can rebuild Gaza “even better than before”if Israel lifts its blockade. DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli forces fired on the crowds on three occasions overnight and into Sunday. Those killed included a child, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel has pulled back from several areas of Gaza as part of the ceasefire, which came into force last Sunday, but the military has warned people to stay away from its forces, which are still operating in a buffer zone inside Gaza along the border and in the Netzarim corridor.

        "content": "Officials say they have recaptured the final four monkeys who escaped two months ago from a South Carolina compound that breeds them for medical research YEMASSEE, S.C. --Authorities in South Carolina said Friday the last four of 43 escaped monkeys have been recaptured after two months living in the woods, weathering arare snowstormand being temped back into captivity by peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. The rhesus macaque monkeys, all females, made a break for it after police say an employee did notfully lock their enclosureat Alpha Genesis, a facility that breeds them for medical research — known to locals as “the monkey farm.” The recaptured monkeys appeared to be in good health, Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard said in a statement relayed by Yemassee Police in a social media post, without further details. While they were on the loose, the area saw its first snow in seven years, accumulating up to 3 inches (8 centimeters). The rhesus macaques made a break for it on Nov. 6, and mostly hung around near the facility. They're about the size of a cat, weighing roughly 7 pounds (3 kilograms). It appears a worker unintentionally left the gates unlocked when the monkeys escaped, Westergaard said in November. Workers were supposed to lock and latch one gate before opening another, but all three gates and latches were left unsecure. The monkeys posed no risk to public health, said Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police. Alpha Guard employees kept an eye on the monkeys and set out humane traps. Most were lured back with food and were given peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and \"monkey biscuits\" — a high-protein Purina Monkey Chow specially formulated for the rhesus macaques. The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical facilities and other researchers. Humans have beenusing the monkeys for scientific researchsince the late 1800s. Scientists believe rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25 million years ago and share about 93% of the same DNA. The compound is about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee and about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)              LAS VEGAS (AP) — PresidentDonald Trumpcame to Las Vegas on Saturday to crow about his campaign promise to eliminate taxes on tips, signaling to allies in Congress the importance of the policy but stopping well short of offering details for making the slogan a reality. Instead, Trump spent most of his 40 minutes speaking to roughly 1,000 supporters in a casino ballroom lauding his November election victory, mocking former President Joe Biden’s administration and touting his torrent of executive actions since taking office Monday. “But I have to be honest with you, I’m really here for a different reason, I’m here to say thank you,” Trump told the crowd at Circa Resort & Casino. The victory lap, Trump’s first swing-state rally since taking office, came after he won Nevada’s six electoral votes in November, becoming the first Republican since George W. Bush in 2004 to carry the state. It was part of Trump’s sweep of all seven of the most competitive states that gave him a healthy electoral majority and a second, non-consecutive term. AP correspondent Julie Walker reports President Trump leans into his pledge to eliminate taxes on tips. Aides said Trump’s stop in Nevada was to deliver an “economic-focused message” built around his familiar promise to hospitality industry workers to remove the tax on gratuity income. “We’re going to get it for you — ‘no tax on tips,’” Trump said, standing behind a podium emblazoned with the same slogan he used throughout the 2024 campaign.  After the rally, Trump strode through the Circa casino floor past its purple-hewed velvet tables, to cheers from visitors of “USA, USA.” At a roulette table, a player yelled, “Give me $47 on 47,” for Trump, now the 47th president. “Ohh,” Trump lamented at the losing throw but he signed autographs as supporters hooted. If light on detail, Trump’s comments on tips were a signal to Republicans in Congress that the proposal is a priority for the massive tax package they intend to pass this year. Trump is set to meet House Republicans on Monday as they gather in Florida to chart the strategy ahead. Speaker Mike Johnson, who is laboring to get the package moving forward, invited Trump to address a joint session of Congress on March 4, a tradition for new presidents, who don’t deliver a State of the Union address until their second year in office. Johnson said lawmakers working with Trump hope to make the next four years “some of the most consequential in our nation’s history.” Nevada is a familiar backdrop to talk tips and taxation. As a candidate, Trump first announced the idea of ending gratuity taxes during a rally in June in Las Vegas — aproposal later copiedby his Democratic opponent,Kamala Harris. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates there are 2.24 million restaurant servers across the country, with tips making up a large percentage of their income. In Las Vegas, the 24-hour economy is fueled by everyone from wait staff and valet parkers to hotel maids and casino dealers, all of whom collect tips. Nevada has the nation’s highest concentration of tipped workers, with about 25.8 waiters and waitresses alone per 1,000 jobs, followed by Hawaii and Florida. Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer for the Culinary Union, which represents about 60,000 hospitality workers across Nevada, said Trump’s plans “must not end” with scrapping taxation on tips. “Eliminating taxes on tips and ending the $2.13 sub-minimum wage — that is the reality in too many states across the country — will uplift millions of hospitality workers,” Pappageorge said. He said many employers set hourly pay well below the federal minimum wage and expect gratuities to make up the difference. Despite the stated focus on taxes, the Nevada rally served mostly as a capstone of sorts to Trump’s first week in office, as he recounted for the crowd the executive orders he’d signed and what they’ll do. “We’ve accomplished more in one week than most administrations have experienced in four years and we’re just getting started,” Trump said, adding that his executive orders “reverse the horrible failures and betrayals that we inherited from a group of people that didn’t know what the hell they were doing.” Trump cited a sweeping freeze on new money for all U.S. foreign assistance, his notice of a U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and his order ceasing diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the federal government, among other things. “We feel a light over our country,” Trump said. ”Everyone does.” Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

(Photo by CJ Rivera/Invision/AP)                     NEW YORK (AP) — To celebrate an upcoming milestone, Alyssa Math could think of nothing more fitting than front-row tickets to “Onyx Storm” author Rebecca Yarros’ appearance at The Town Hall in Manhattan. “I’m getting married next weekend, so this is my bachelorette party,” said Math, an accountant who traveled with friends from her home near Annapolis, Maryland. She has been one of millions of admirers of Yarros’ work and a year ago drove two hours to Reston, Virginia, to see the author. “It’s a huge cult following,” said Math, wearing a white veil in homage to one of Yarros’ characters. “The drama (of her books) keeps you on the edge of your seat.” Friday night at The Town Hall had the feel of a costume party, rock concert and family reunion as a capacity crowd of around 1,500 clapped, laughed and shouted, “Yes, Queen!” The “Empyrean” series has made Yarros one of the country’s most popular and obsessed-about leaders of romantasy, a newly branded genre combinging romance and fantasy. “Onyx Storm” is the much-awaited third installment of a planned five centered on the lovers Violet and Xaden, and the first since the million-selling “Iron Flame” came out in 2023. In its first week of publication, “Onyx Storm” has already topped the bestseller lists of Amazon and sold more than 300,000 copies just through Barnes & Noble, according to a spokesperson for the superstore chain. Yarros, interviewed for some 75 minutes by Olympic gymnast and avowed fan Laurie Hernandez, shared a few insights about her writings (she already knows how the series will end), spoke lovingly of her husband (“He’s 6'4\" and hot as hell with a baby strapped to his chest”), swore casually and joked that hers was the “only profession where you can have imaginary fiends” and not be considered insane.  She expressed relief and pleasure over completing “Onyx Storm,” noting she had to block out her own popularity to get the writing done. “As much as I love you guys, I kind of pretend you don’t exist,” she said. “I kind of ignore you, but I love you at the same time.” “Onyx Storm” isn’t quite a Harry Potter-level phenomenon — the final Potter book byJ.K. Rowling, “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” sold more than 8 million copies in the U.S. in its first 24 hours — but it carries a similar feeling of obsession, identification and spontaneity. Like the Potter books, the release of “Onyx Storm” was welcomed with midnight store parties around the country, gatherings for which fans showed up in costume. Some fans at The Town Hall finished the 526-page “Onyx Storm” within hours of receiving it, others are in no hurry. “This is a book I personally want to take my time with,” said Scarlett Fuentes, who arrived with her friend Zy Bao-angan, both of them in black leather. “I want to savor this moment,” Bao-angan said. Like Potter, enthusiasm for the Yarros books extends well beyond any organized publicity campaigns. The Potter books helped inspire some of the first Internet fan sites for books. Yarros and such fellow romantasy authors asSarah J. Maashave been favorites of the young readers on BookTok, a TikTok community that has emerged as publishing’s most effective driver of sales. Countless fans on BookTok and other social media — some crying, some cursing in amazement — have been posting their responses to “Onyx Storm.” On Friday, Hernandez and the audience posed questions about her books as if gossiping about friends. If Violet and Xaden were at a bar, what would they order? Violet would go for a lavender lemon drop, Xaden is fine with a beer. And which music genres define them? Xenon is heavy metal, Violet harder to label. Asked what was the most important lessons she has learned from writing the books, Yarros reminded her fans that she wasn’t only a writer or public figure. “I can say plotting and I can say everything, but probably the most important thing I’ve learned is that real life is what happens in my house, and what happens around my kitchenette and what happens in my living room chairs and what happens when my kids are all together and my husband’s together,” she said. “Real life is not what happens on the internet.” “I love you guys,” she added. “But peace out.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) Shoppers pass displays of goods in a Costco warehouse Sunday, Feb. 25, 2024, in Sheridan, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)         WASHINGTON (AP) — Two months ago, in his first network television interview after the election,Donald Trumpsaid he owed his victory to Americans’ anger over immigration and inflation, specifically the rising cost of groceries. “When you buy apples, when you buy bacon, when you buy eggs, they would double and triple the price over a short period of time,” he told NBC’s “Meet the Press. “And I won an election based on that. We’re going to bring those prices way down.” But in Trump’s first week back in the White House, there was little in his initial blitz ofexecutive ordersthat directly tackled those prices, besides directing federal agencies to start“pursuing appropriate actions.”He is taking steps to lower energy costs, something that Trump hopes will have ripple effects throughout the economy. Otherwise, his focus has been clamping down on immigration, which he described as his “No. 1 issue” shortly after taking the oath of office. “They all said inflation was the No. 1 issue. I said, ‘I disagree,’” Trump said. “I talked about inflation too, but how many times can you say that an apple has doubled in cost?” Trump is banking on voters giving him a pass andcontinuing to blame former President Joe Bidenfor high prices. The Republican’s comments reflect the reality that presidents have almost no levers to reduce inflation quickly without causing collateral damage to other parts of the economy.  There is more that Trump can do on energy. He is pushing to reduce regulations andincrease the amount of landavailable for drilling. He is trying to persuade domestic and foreign oil producers to potentially sacrifice their own profitsby pumping more. During a rally Saturday in Las Vegas, Trump went after his Democratic predecessor for allowing prices to rise under his watch, and promised to take care of the problem quickly. “When I think of Biden, I think of incompetence and inflation,” Trump said. Inflation peaked at a 9.1% annual rate in June 2022 during worldwide supply chain problems after the economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. Overall consumer prices have fallen since then, but have ticked up in recent months, from 2.4% in September to 2.9% in December, the latest figures available. Economists have warned that Trump’s plans for tariffs and tax cuts could create new inflationary pressures and keep interest rates elevated. Vice President JD Vance, in an interview with CBS’ “Face the Nation” airing Sunday, defended the White House’s work so far. “Prices are going to come down, but it’s going to take a little bit of time, right?” he said. He added, “Rome wasn’t built in a day.” Trump’s relative shift away from addressing costs could create an opening for Democrats to say he is not helping working-class voters, hoping that argument could offer the party a path back to power in Washington. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said Trump preferred to distract people from inflation with talk of adding Greenland to the United States or seizing the Panama Canal. “It’s catnip and it causes everybody to stop paying attention to their actual economic agenda, which has nothing to do with lowering costs and everything to do with rigging the economy to help the Mar-a-Lago crowd,” he said. During an interview on Fox News this past week, host Sean Hannity struggled to get Trump to focus on the economy. “Let me get to the economy,” Hannity said at one point. “I’m running out of time.” “The economy is going to do great,” Trump insisted. When Trump did talk about inflation in the interview, he noted how low it was during his first term and insisted prices would not have jumped up if he had president after the 2020 election, even though higher inflation was a global trend coming out of the pandemic. It is not clear how Trump would persuade oil companies and foreign countries to quickly increase production, possibly costing them profits. The Energy Information Administration reported that domestic oil production has grown at an annual rate of roughly 8.4% over the past two years to an average of nearly 13.5 million barrels a day in October. Some Trump aides suggest that could increase by an additional 3 million barrels a day. It would be difficult to achieve that much additional production in a single year without serious changes to the global market. The International Energy Agency estimates that the oil supplied to the entire world will increase by 1.8 million barrels per day to 104.7 million barrels a day. He also has expressed opposition to climate-friendlier wind and solar energy, putting more pressure on the U.S. economy to rely on fossil fuels. EJ Antoni, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, said the potential increase in energy production under Trump would ultimately flow through the economy in the form of lower prices. “If you’re going to bring down the cost of energy, you’re going to bring down the cost of all kinds of goods and services,” he said. But there is a risk that some of Trump’s plans taken as a whole could raise — not reduce — prices. Deporting migrants who are in the United States illegally could deprive companies of lower wage workers. The cost of tariffs, which are taxes placed on foreign imports, could be passed on to consumers. Trump said that his strategy also might ultimately involvepublicly pressuring the Federal Reserveto cut interest rates, saying in Davos that he would “demand” lower rates from central banks. The Fed sees its political independence as key for making tough choices to stabilize prices. Biden saw the independence as worth protecting, whereas Trump sees it as problematic. The Fed raised its benchmark rates starting in 2022 to make it more expensive to borrow and succeeded enough in reducing inflationary pressures that it could trim rates late last year. Trump believes that greater oil production will put him in a position to tell the Fed what to do. Asked in the Oval Office if he expects the Fed to listen to him, Trump simply said, “Yeah.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

        "content": "The Democratic senator also said Tulsi Gabbard isn't qualified to serve as DNI. Michigan Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin explained why she voted against confirming Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense on ABC News' \"This Week\" on Sunday, saying she had not been confident Hegseth would be more loyal to the Constitution than he would be to President Donald Trump.. Hegseth, a former Fox News host, was sworn into the role on Saturday following a razor-thin vote in the Senate. Slotkin, who joined the Senate in January and previously worked for multiple national security agencies, including the Department of Defense, told \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz that it was important in confirmation hearings that nominees knew they were \"raising your right hand and pledging an oath to the Constitution -- not Donald Trump -- and that if Donald Trump asks you to do something that contravenes the Constitution, you would push back.\" \"He couldn't unambiguously say that he will push back if the president asked him to do something that wasn't constitutional, and that, to me, is why I couldn't confirm him,\" Slotkin said. \"There's a lot of other things in his background I don't like, but I look at what is the strategic and irreversible threats to our democracy, and that's using the uniform military in ways that violate the Constitution.\" The vote to confirm Hegseth was initially 50-50 until Vice President JD Vance, in his role as president of the Senate, cast the tie-breaking vote. Every Democrat voted against Hegseth's confirmation, as did Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. His nomination process was marred by accusations ofsexual misconduct, excessive drinking and financial mismanagement of two different veterans organizations. He hasdeniedall the allegations. During Hegseth's confirmation hearing, Slotkin questioned him on whether he supports active-duty military members supporting immigrant detention centers if ordered to do so by Trump. With 1,500 soldiers and Marines now at or deploying to the border, Slotkin stressed on \"This Week\" that the military should not take on a law enforcement role in this new mission. \"According to our Constitution, you can go in supporting roles -- logistics, driving, setting up facilities, setting up, you know, border locations, whatever -- it's very different when you cross the line into law enforcement,\" she said. \"Our military are not trained as law enforcement officers -- they'll be the first one to tell you that. That's not why they got into service, and it's also in violation of our Constitution, so I think it's very important that we keep that line.\" Slotkin said it was important to know \"you're not going to use the uniform military in ways that violates the Constitution and makes American citizens scared of their own military.\" \"We were scared of the British when they occupied us,\" she said. \"We don't want to repeat that, so I'm watching that very, very closely.\" Slotkin also spoke about Tulsi Gabbard's upcoming confirmation hearing for the role of director of national intelligence. Slotkin was one of the first employees in the director's office, working there between 2005 and 2006 in between stints at the CIA as an analyst. \"I served with Tulsi Gabbard. We were on the Armed Services Committee together. She didn't spend a lot of time showing up to hearings, so I didn't get to see her in action all that much,\" Slotkin said. \"But from what I understand from people who have been meeting directly with her -- and she hasn't asked to meet with me -- is that she doesn't show the competence, the understanding, the depth. She wasn't prepared for her meetings, not to mention the deeply questionable decisions she's made of cozying up to [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, flying and cozying up with Assad in Syria.\" Slotkin said she does \"not believe [Gabbard] is qualified for this role.\" \"You know, having someone in charge of our intelligence organization that shows a preference for our adversaries, to me, is just right off the bat, a deep question,\" Slotkin said. \"And so again, I hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who now have control of the Senate, control of the House, that they think about, again, their commitment to the country, not to any one party.\" Gabbard's confirmation hearing is scheduled for Thursday before the Senate Intelligence Committee. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Meanwhile, the November ceasefire in Lebanon is holding despite ongoing Israeli airstrikes on Hezbollah targets, which Israeli officials say are responses to ceasefire violations by the Iranian-backed militant group. Israeli forces also remain active inside the Syrian border region as victorious rebels there build a transitional government. Tensions remain high between Israel and Iran after tit-for-tat long-range strikes in recent months and threats of further military action from both sides. The IDF and the Yemeni Houthis also continue to exchange attacks. The death toll from an attack Sunday by the Israel Defense Forces in southern Lebanon has climbed to 22, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. At least 124 people have been injured in the attack, including nine children, the health ministry said. Sunday was supposed to be the last day of a ceasefire deal that saw the IDF completely withdraw from Lebanon, but the IDF remains in several areas in the south. -ABC News' Victoria Beaule Jordanian officials have rejected President Trump's comments about Egypt and Jordan \"taking\" in more displaced Palestinians. Jordan's position \"rejecting the displacement of Palestinians is fixed and unchangeable and is necessary to achieve the stability and peace that we all want,\" Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Ayman Safadi said during a Foreign Ministry press conference on Sunday.   \"We renew our position of rejecting the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza. Our position is that the two-state solution is the way to achieve peace, and our rejection of displacement is fixed and unchangeable,\" Safadi said, stressing that \"the solution to the Palestinian issue is a Palestinian solution, and Jordan is for Jordanians and Palestine is for Palestinians.\" Safadi added, \"Our approach is clear, to establish the Palestinians in their land and implement the two-state solution.\" Safadi said a priority now is to consolidate the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and bring aid to the residents of the area. ”We are working to bring aid into Gaza without interruption in preparation for the start of reconstruction operations,\" Safadi said. He said Jordon is looking forward to working with the U.S. administration to achieve peace in the region. -ABC News' Ghazi Balkiz Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted a short video message on social media on Sunday thanking President Donald Trump for his decision to resume shipments to Israel of the 2,000-pound bombs that former President Joe Biden halted. \"Thank you President Trump for keeping your promise to give Israel the tools it needs to defend itself, to confront our common enemies and to secure a future of peace and prosperity,\" Netanyahu said in apost on X. On Saturday, Trump ordered the U.S. to resume shipments of the 2,000-pound bombs to Israel. In May, Biden halted the shipments, claiming at the time that the weapons were being used in areas with high concentrations of civilians, leading to civilian deaths. -ABC News' Nate Luna and Michelle Stoddart In a statement Sunday, the Hamas-run Government Media Office in Gaza said it \"strongly\" condemns statements about what it described as the \"so-called transfer of Gaza citizens to neighboring countries.\" President Trump on Saturday spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One andsaid he spoke with King Abdullah II of Jordanabout taking more Palestinians from Gaza. \"I've gotten along with him over the years very well. He's done a wonderful job. He really houses, you know, millions of Palestinians, and he does it in a very humane way and I complimented him. But he really -- Jordan's done an amazing job of housing largely Palestinians,\" Trump said. He continued, \"I said to him that I'd love you to take on more 'cause I'm looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now and it's a mess, it's a real mess.\" When asked for clarification, Trump indicated he'd like Jordan and Egypt to take more Palestinians from Gaza. \"They can take people. I'd like Egypt to take people. I'm meeting with ... I'm talking with General El-Sisi tomorrow sometime. And I'd like Egypt to take people and I'd like Jordan to take people.

        "content": "The FBI said a 21-year-old woman was arrested for fatally shooting the agent. An arrest has been made in thefatal shooting of a U.S. Border Patrol agentduring a traffic stop in Vermont, according to the FBI, as bizarre details of the suspects' movements beforehand have been revealed in the arrest affidavit. Teresa Youngblut, 21, of Washington state, was arrested on Friday and charged with assault on a federal law enforcement officer, according to a statement from the FBI. The affidavit unsealed by investigators reveals some new details about the movements of the two individuals who were involved in the fatal shooting of Border Patrol agent David Maland. Since Jan. 14, investigators had been conducting \"periodic surveillance\" on Youngblut and Felix Baukholt, a German national who was killed during the shooting, after they were reported as suspicious by someone who was staying at the same hotel as the pair, according to court records. \"An employee of a hotel in Lyndonville, Vermont contacted law enforcement after a male and a female had checked into the hotel to report concerns about them, including that they appeared to be dressed in all-black tactical style clothing with protective equipment, with the woman, later identified as Youngblut, carrying an apparent firearm in an exposed-carry holster,\" according to charges unsealed in Vermont federal court on Friday. Agents from the Vermont State Police and Homeland Security Investigations attempted to approach the pair for a voluntary interview, but they rebuffed law enforcement, \"claiming that they were in the vicinity to look at purchasing property,\" according to the court records. Five days later, the pair were spotted in downtown Newport, Vermont, in \"similar tactical dress\" and carrying a handgun, which is permitted in Vermont, the affidavit said. On Monday, the day of the fatal shooting, the two were being observed by law enforcement in the parking lot of a Walmart nearby, prosecutors said. Investigators observed Baukholt come out of the store with rolls of aluminum foil that he then used to wrap cellphones, they said. The stop was initiated by Border Patrol agents under the pretext of an immigration violation, according to the court records. Between 3 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. agents reported gunshots from the scene, according to the affidavit. Agents described to their supervisor \"that both Baukholt and Youngblut possessed firearms and that Youngblut drew and fired a handgun toward at least one of the uniformed Border Patrol agents without warning when outside the driver's side of the Prius. Baukholt then attempted to draw a firearm. At least one Border Patrol agent fired at Youngblut and Baukholt with his service weapon,\" according to the affidavit. Upon searching the vehicle, agents found a cache of weapons and tactical gear, as well as the cellphones wrapped in foil. The agents have not been interviewed according to the complaint, officials said. \"Agent Maland bravely served his country as a member of the U.S. Air Force,\" said Special Agent in Charge Craig Tremaroli of the FBI Albany Field Office in a statement. \"He continued that service when he answered the call to protect and serve as a law enforcement officer, making him a shining example of service over self. This arrest proves the FBI, together with our partners, will work diligently to ensure any individual who uses a firearm to assault such a public servant will be brought to justice.\" ABC News' Alex Faul contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(Neon via AP)         NEW YORK (AP) — Critics lambasted it and audiences didn’t grade it much better. But despite the turbulence,Mel Gibson’s “Flight Risk”managed to open No. 1 at the box office with a modest $12 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. On a quiet weekend, even for the typically frigid movie-going month of January, the top spot went to the Lionsgate thriller starring Mark Wahlberg as a pilot flying an Air Marshal (Michelle Dockery) and fugitive (Topher Grace) across Alaska. But it wasn’t a particularly triumphant result for Gibson’s directorial follow-up to 2016’s“Hacksaw Ridge.”Reviews (21% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores (a “C” CinemaScore) were terrible. President Donald Trumprecentlynamed Gibson a “special ambassador”to Hollywood, along with Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone. Going into the weekend, Hollywood’s attention was more focused on theSundance Film Festivaland on Thursday’sOscar nominations, which were twice postponed by thewildfires in the Los Angeles region. The weekend was also a small test as to whether the once more common Oscar “bump” that can sometimes follow nominations still exists. Most contenders have by now completed the bulk of their theatrical runs and are more likely to see an uptick on VOD or streaming. But the weekend’s most daring gambit was A24 pushingBrady Corbet’s “The Brutalist”a three–and-a-half-hour epic nominated for 10 Academy Awards, into wide release. Though some executives initially greeted “The Brutalist,” which is running with an intermission, as “un-distributable,” Corbet has said, A24 acquired the film out of the Venice Film Festival and it’s managed solid business, collecting $6 million in limited release.  In wide release, it earned $2.9 million — a far from blockbuster sum but the best weekend yet for “The Brutalist.” The audience was downright miniscule for another best-picture nominee: RaMell Ross’“Nickel Boys.”Innovatively shot almost entirely in first-person POV, the Amazon MGM Studios release gathered just $340,171 in 540 locations after expanding by 300 theaters. Coming offone of the lowest Martin Luther King Jr. weekends in years, no new releases made a major impact. Steven Soderbergh’s “Presence,”a well-reviewed horror film shot from the perspective of a ghost inside a suburban home, debuted with $3.4 million in 1,750 locations. The film, released by Neon and acquired out of last year’s Sundance, was made for just $2 million. The top spots otherwise went to holdovers. The Walt Disney Co.’s“Mufasa: The Lion King,”in its sixth weekend of release, scored $8.7 million to hold second place. After starting slow, the Barry Jenkins-directed film has amassed $626.7 million globally. “One of Them Days,”the Keke Palmer and SZA led comedy from Sony Pictures, held well in its second weekend, dropping just 32% with $8 million in ticket sales. In recent years, few comedies have found success on the big screen, but “One of Them Days” has proven an exception. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. “Flight Risk,” $12 million. 2. “Mufasa: The Lion King,” $8.7 million. 3. “One of Them Days,” $8 million. 4. “Sonic the Hedgehog 3,” $5.5 million. 5. “Moana 2,” $4.3 million. 6. “Presence,” $3.4 million. 7. “Wolf Man,” $3.4 million. 8. “A Complete Unknown,” $3.1 million. 9. “Den of Thieves 2: Pantera,” $3 million. 10. “The Brutalist,” $2.9 million.

Bridgestone said the closure will help the company “optimize its business footprint” and “strengthen its competitiveness.” In addition, Bridgestone announced capacity and workforce reductions at its Des Moines, Iowa, agriculture tire plant and additional workforce reductions in U.S. corporate, sales and operations. In Latin America, it plans reductions in workforce and production capacity in Argentina and Brazil. “Reductions in force are impacting our corporate, sales and operations in the Americas where a realignment of staffing levels is needed in response to the challenging economic environment,” company spokesperson Emily Weaver said in an email. “Of our nearly 44,000 teammates across North America and Latin America, just under 4% of our teammates are leaving the company as part of the voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions.” The LaVergne plant was the first tire-producing facility in North America for the Bridgestone Corporation. The company stopped making tires for cars and light trucks at the plant in 2009, laying off roughly half of the workers at the time. LaVergne's United Steelworkers master union workers have preferential hiring rights at the company's plants in Des Moines; Akron, Ohio; and Russellville, Arkansas, Weaver said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(AP Photo/Erin Hooley, file)     CHICAGO (AP) — Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove visited Chicago on Sunday to witness the start of ramped-upimmigration enforcementin the nation’s third-largest citypromised by the Trump administration, though few details of the operation were made public. Bove said he was in Chicago on Sunday morning and observed Department of Homeland Security agents, along with assisting federal agencies — including the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives. He didn’t say where the operations took place in the city or detail any arrests. “We will support everyone at the federal, state, and local levels who joins this critical mission to take back our communities,” Bove said in a statement. “We will use all available tools to address obstruction and other unlawful impediments to our efforts to protect the homeland. Most importantly, we will not rest until the work is done.” U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Jeff Carter said the agency “began conducting enhanced targeted operations” Sunday in Chicago but declined other details, citing an ongoing operation. Spokesmen for the FBI, ATF and the Drug Enforcement Administration confirmed their involvement but didn’t give other information. Chicago residents, especially in immigrant circles,have already been on edgefor months in anticipation of large-scale arrests touted by the Trump administration. The atmosphere has been especially tense the past week as top Trump officialsvowedto start immigration enforcement operations in Chicago the day after Trump’sinaugurationbefore walking back those statements.  Immigrant rights groups havetried to preparewith campaigns for immigrants to know their rights in case of an arrest. City officials have done the same, publishing similar information at public bus and train stations. On Friday, Chicago Public Schools officialsmistakenly believedICE agents had come to a city elementary school and put out statements to that effect before learning the agents were from the Secret Service. Word of immigration agents at a school — which have long been off limits to immigration agents untilTrump ended the policylast week — drew swift criticism from community groups and Gov. JB Pritzker. The Democratic governor, a frequent Trump critic, questioned the aggressive approach of the operations and the chilling effect for others, particularly for law-abiding immigrants who have been in the country for years. “We need to get rid of the violent criminals. But we also need to protect people, at least the residents of Illinois and all across the nation, who are just doing what we hope that immigrants will do,” Pritzker said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Chicago has been one of Trump’s favorite targets. The city has some of the strongest sanctuary protections, which bar cooperation between city police and immigration agents. On Saturday, several Chicago-based immigrant rights groups filed a lawsuit against ICE, seeking an injunction prohibiting certain types of immigration raids in Chicago. “Immigrant communities who have called Chicago their home for decades are scared,” said Antonio Gutierrez from Organized Communities Against Deportation, one of the plaintiffs. “We refuse to live in fear and will fight any attempts to roll back the work we’ve done to keep families together.” Durkin Richer reported from Washington.

NASA’s four Magnetospheric Multiscale, or MMS, satellites at the Astrotech Space Operations facility in Titusville, Florida, March 2015. (NASA via AP) NEW YORK (AP) — Scientists have detected cosmic waves thatsound like birds chirpingin an unexpected place. These bursts of plasma, called chorus waves, ripple at the same frequency ashuman hearing. When converted to audio signals, their sharp notes mimichigh-pitched bird calls. Researchers have captured such sounds in space before, but now they have sensed the chirping waves from much farther away: over 62,000 miles (100,000 kilometers) from Earth, where they’ve never been measured before. “That opens up a lot of new questions about the physics that could be possible in this area,” said Allison Jaynes, a space physicist at the University of Iowa who was not involved with the work. AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on scientists sensing a chirping chorus in an unexpected place. Scientists still aren’t sure how the perturbations happen, but they thinkEarth’s magnetic fieldmay have something to do with it. The chorus has been picked up on radio antennas for decades, including receivers at an Antarctica research station in the 1960s. And twin spacecraft — NASA’s Van Allen Probes — heard the chirps from Earth’s radiation belts at a closer distance than the newest detection. The latest notes were picked up by NASA’s Magnetospheric Multiscale satellites, launched in 2015 to explore the Earth and sun’s magnetic fields. The new researchwas published Wednesdayin the journal Nature. Chorus waves have also been spotted near other planets including Jupiter and Saturn. They can even produce high-energy electrons capable of scrambling satellite communications.   “They are one of the strongest and most significant waves in space,” said study author Chengming Liu from Beihang University in an email. The newfound chorus waves were detected in a region where Earth’s magnetic field is stretched out, which scientists didn’t expect. That raises fresh questions about how these chirping waves form. “It’s very captivating, very compelling,” Jaynes said. “We definitely need to find more of these events.” The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Palestinian families have been displaced from the northern Gaza Strip since October 2023 when the Israel-Hamas war erupted. According to the ceasefire deal, the Israeli military had been expected to allow hundreds of thousands of Palestinian to return to northern Gaza through a road that bisects the territory starting Sunday. Israel has yet to allow Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza on foot through the so-called Netzarim corridor bisecting the territory, which extends from the Wadi Gaza river valley to Gaza City. It put the move on hold until Hamas freed a hostage who Israel said was supposed to have been released that day. (Production by Wafaa Shurafa) Israel has said that it needs to stay longer because the Lebanese army has not deployed to all areas of southern Lebanon to ensure that Hezbollah does not reestablish a military presence in the area. (AP Video shot by Bassam Al Masri)                                     DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel kept thousands of Palestinians from returning to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday as it accused Hamas of violatinga fragile ceasefireby changing the order of hostages it has released. Local health officials said Israeli forces fired on the crowd, killing two people and wounding nine. Israeli forcesalso opened fire in Lebanonon protesters demanding their withdrawal by Sunday’s deadline under a separate ceasefire with the Hezbollah militant group. Health officials in Lebanon said at least 22 people were killed and over 120 wounded. Israel says it hasn’t withdrawn because Lebanese forces are not deploying quickly enough, while Lebanon says its forces cannot move into areas until Israeli troops leave. U.S. President Donald Trump meanwhile suggested that most of Gaza’s populationbe at least temporarily resettled elsewhere, including in Egypt and Jordan, to “just clean out” the war-ravaged enclave. Jordan and the Palestinians swiftly rejected that, and Egypt has previously rejected the scenario, fearing Israelmight never allow refugees to return. Senior Hamas official Bassem Naim said Palestinians would never accept such a proposal, “even if seemingly well-intentioned under the guise of reconstruction.” He said the Palestinians can rebuild Gaza “even better than before”if Israel lifts its blockade. Under the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, Israel on Saturday was to begin allowing Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza throughthe Netzarim corridorbisecting the territory. Israel put that on hold until Hamas frees a civilian hostage who Israel said should have been released Saturday. Hamas accused Israel of violating the agreement.  Crowds of people carrying their belongings filled a main road leading to a closed Israeli checkpoint. “We have been in agony for a year and a half,” said Nadia Qasem. Fadi al-Sinwar, also displaced from Gaza City, said “the fate of more than a million people is linked to one person,” referring to the Israeli hostage, Arbel Yehoud. “See how valuable we are? We are worthless,” he said. Israeli forces fired on the crowds on three occasions overnight and into Sunday, killing two people and wounding nine, including a child, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. Israel’s military in a statement said it fired warning shots at “several gatherings of dozens of suspects who were advancing toward the troops and posed a threat to them.” Israel has pulled back from several areas of Gaza under the ceasefire, which came into effect last Sunday. The military has warned people to stay away from its forces, which still operate in a buffer zone inside Gaza along the border and in the Netzarim corridor. Hamasfreed four female Israeli soldierson Saturday, and Israel released some 200 Palestinian prisoners, most of whom were serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks. But Israel said Yehoud should have been released ahead of the soldiers. The release of four Israeli hostages Saturday comes nearly a week into a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and is part of a long and uncertain process aimed at eventually ending the war. The AP’s Sam Mednick explains. Israel also accused Hamas of failing to provide details on the conditions of hostages set to be freed in the remaining five weeks of the ceasefire’s first phase. In a statement, Hamas said it had told mediators — the United States, Egypt and Qatar — that Yehoud was alive and provided guarantees that she would be released. A spokesman for Gaza’s second-largest militant group, Islamic Jihad, later said the dispute over Yehoud had been settled. Mohamed al-Hajj Mousa said the group told mediators she will be released before Saturday. But an Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the behind-the-scenes talks, said there was still no deal. The ceasefire is aimed at ending the 15-month war triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack and freeing hostages still held in Gaza in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Around 90 hostages are still in Gaza, and Israeli authorities believe at least a third, and up to half, have died. Itzik Horn, the father of hostages Iair and Eitan Horn, called any resumption of fighting “a death sentence for the hostages” and criticized government ministers who want the war to go on. The ceasefire’s first phase runs until early March and includes the release of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The second — and far more difficult — phase, has yet to be negotiated. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining hostages without an end to the war, while Israel has threatened to resume its offensive until Hamas is destroyed. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 attack, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. More than 100 were freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the remains of dozens more, at least three of them mistakenly killed by Israeli forces. Seven have been freed in the latest ceasefire. Israel’s military campaign has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not say how many of the dead were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. Israeli bombardment and ground operationshave flattened wide swaths of Gazaand displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. Many who have returned home since the ceasefire began have found only mounds of rubble. Magdy reported from Cairo and Krauss from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "Researchers say they are puzzled over the discovery. Astronomers have detected fast-repeating radio bursts from a distant \"dead\" galaxy that should not contain the energy to produce these types of signals, according to new research. The source of the fast radio bursts (FRBs) -- sudden flashes of radio waves that last just milliseconds -- has previously been linked to young, magnetized neutron stars that expend a lot of energy when they are forming. But the dormant galaxy from which these radio bursts are originating should not contain this type of young star, according to a paper published Wednesday inThe Astrophysical Journal Letters. Researchers expect FRBs to originate inside of a galaxy and, because these FRBs are so energetic, within a region of a galaxy in which new stars are actively forming, Vishwangi Shah, a PhD student in the Department of Physics and the Trottier Space Institute at McGill University, told ABC News. These FRBs, named FRB 20240209A, are located outside of the massive ancient elliptical galaxy it is associated with that only contains old and dead stars, Shah said. \"This discovery was really surprising and exciting,\" she said. Shah and her team used the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment -- also known as the CHIME telescope -- to detect the multiple bursts from the same location, Shah said. But because the CHIME telescope could not pinpoint the exact location of the radio waves, they combined it with a smaller CHIME-like telescope to pinpoint the location of the FRB. They then used the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii to image the region around the location of the FRBs. The Gemini image confirmed that there is no other galaxy present near the FRB and the FRB is indeed associated with the dead galaxy. \"There's no other galaxy there,\" Shah said. The ancient elliptical galaxy where astronomers discovered the radio waves is about 2 billion light-years from Earth and is about 11.3 billion years old, according to the paper. Thousands of radio bursts have been recorded since 2007, when they were first discovered by astronomers, Shah said, adding that they only know the precise locations of about 100 of them -- all near actively forming stars. \"This particular FRB is really an outlier, and it challenges our theories about what is producing FRBs,\" Shah said. Astronomers hypothesize that the FRBs could be originating from two supernova remnants, called neutron stars, that are merging or collapsing onto themselves, Shah said. Continuing to study these FRBs will allow researchers to further understand the space between its origination and the Milky Way as well as what is happening in distant regions of space, Shah said. \"That is why it is a really useful probe of our universe,\" she said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)               SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean prosecutors on Sunday indictedimpeached President Yoon Suk Yeolon rebellion in connection with his short-lived imposition of martial law, a criminal charge that could incur the death penalty or life imprisonment if convicted. This is thelatest blow to Yoon, who was impeached and arrested over his Dec. 3 martial law decree that plunged the country intopolitical turmoil, shook its financial markets and hurt its international image. Separate from criminal judicial proceedings, the Constitutional Court is now deliberating whether to formally dismiss Yoon as president or reinstate him. Yoon has become South Korea’s first president who has been indicted while in office. He will remain jailed and be escorted from a detention facility to a Seoul court for hearings in the trial, which is expected to last about six months. Prosecutors said in a statement that they indicted Yoon on charges that he directed a rebellion when he imposed martial law. Investigative authorities have earlier alleged that Yoon’s imposition of martial law amounted to rebellion, because he staged riots with the purpose of undermining the constitution. Yoon’s defense team lashed out at the indictment, calling it “the worst decision” by prosecutors who they say are trying to curry favor with political forces who want Yoon’s exit. “Today’s indictment of the president will remain as a shame in the history of South Korean prosecutors that they cannot erase,” Yoon’s defense team said in a statement. “We stress once again that a president’s declaration of martial law can never be rebellion.”  Yoon has presidential immunity from most criminal prosecutions, but the privilege doesn’t extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. By law in South Korea, the leader of a rebellion can face a life sentence or capital punishment. Yoon, a conservative, has steadfastlydenied any wrongdoing, describing his declaration of martial law as a legitimate act of governance meant to raise public awareness of the danger of the liberal-controlled National Assembly, which obstructed his agenda and impeached top officials. During his announcement of martial law, Yoon called the assembly “a den of criminals” and vowed to eliminate “shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces.” After declaring martial law on Dec. 3, Yoon sent troops and police officers to the assembly, but enough lawmakers still managed to enter an assembly chamber to vote down Yoon’s decree unanimously, forcing his Cabinet to lift it. The martial law imposition,the first of its kindin South Korea in more than four decades, lasted only six hours. However, it evoked painful memories of past dictatorial rules in South Korea in the 1960s-80s when military-backed rulers used martial laws and emergency decrees to suppress opponents. South Korea’s constitution gives the president the power to declare martial law to keep order in wartime and other comparable emergency states, but many experts say the country wasn’t under such conditions when Yoon declared martial law. Yoon insists that he hadno intentions of disrupting assembly work, including its floor vote on his decree and that deploying troops and police forces was meant to maintain order. But commanders of military units sent to the assembly have told assembly hearings or investigators that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to prevent them from overturning his decree. Investigations on Yoon have intensified the country’s already serious internal division,with rival protestersregularly staging rallies in downtown Seoul. After a local court on Jan. 19 approved a formal arrest warrant to extend Yoon’s detention, dozens of his supporters stormed the court building, destroying windows, doors and other property. They also attacked police officers with bricks, steel pipes and other objects. The violence left 17 police officers injured, and police said that they detained 46 protesters. Yoon earlier resisted efforts by investigative authorities to question or detain him.He then was apprehended on Jan. 15in a huge law enforcement operation at his presidential compound. Leading Yoon’s investigation was the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, but Yoon has refused to attend CIO questioning sessions since being detained, saying it has no legal authority to investigate rebellion allegations. The CIO has said that it can investigate Yoon’s rebellion allegation because it’s related to his purported abuse of power and other allegations. The CIO handed over Yoon’s case to the Seoul prosecutors’ office on Friday and asked it to indict him on charges of rebellion, abuse of power and obstruction of the National Assembly. Prosecutors said they indicted Yoon only on rebellion, considering that Yoon had presidential immunity from other charges. Yoon’s defense minister, police chief and several other military commanders have already been arrested on alleged rebellion, abuse of power and other charges related to the martial law decree. If the Constitutional Court rules to drive Yoon out of office, a national election to choose his successor must be held within two months. Recent public surveys show that governing and opposition party candidates are running neck-and-neck in a possible presidential by-election race.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ben Curtis)           WASHINGTON (AP) —President Donald Trump’sfirst week in office isn’t over yet, but already itoffers signalsabout how his next four years in the White House may unfold. Some takeaways from the earliest days of his second term: Within hours of being sworn in, Trumppardoned more than 1,500people who were convicted or charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by his supporters. Those pardonedinclude people who attacked, bloodied and beat police officers that day. The Republican president’s decision was at odds with earlier comments by his incoming vice president, JD Vance, and other senior aides that Trump would only let off those who weren’t violent. The pardons were the first of many moves he made in his first week to reward allies and punish critics, in both significant and subtle ways. It signaled that without the need to worry about reelection — the Constitution bars a third term — or legal consequences after the Supreme Court granted presidents expansive immunity, the new president, backed by a Republican Congress, has little to restrain him. Trump ended protective security details forDr. Anthony Fauci, his former COVID-19 adviser, along with former national security adviser John Bolton, formerSecretary of State Mike Pompeoand his onetime deputy. The security protections had been regularly extended by the Biden administration over credible threats to the men’s lives. Trump alsorevokedthe security clearances of dozens of former government officials who had criticized him, including Bolton, and directed that the portrait of a former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, retired Gen. Mark Milley be removed from the Pentagon walls.  In his first days in office, Trump demonstrated just how much he and his team had learned from four often-chaotic years in the White House and four more in political exile. A president’s most valuable resource is time and Trump set out in his first hours to make his mark on the nation with executive orders, policy memoranda and government staffing shake-ups. It reflected a level of sophistication that eluded him in his first term and surpassed his Democratic predecessors in its scale and scope for their opening days in the Oval Office. Feeling burned by the holdover of Obama administration appointees during his first go-around, Trumpswiftly exiledBiden holdovers and moved to test new hires for their fealty to his agenda. In a matter of days heuprooted four yearsof diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the federal government, sent federal troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and erased Biden’s guardrails on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency development. In his first term, Trump’s early executive orders were more showpieces than substance and frequently were blocked by federal courts. This time, Trump is still confronting the limits of his constitutional authorities, but is also far more adept at controlling what is within them. An hour after concluding a relatively sedate inaugural address in the Capitol Rotunda, Trump decided to let loose. Speaking to an overflow crowd of governors, political supports and dignitaries in the Capitol Visitor Center’s Emancipation Hall, Trump ripped in to Biden, the Justice Department and other perceived rivals. He followed it up with an even longer speech to supporters at a downtown arena and in more than 50 minutes of remarks and questions and answers with reporters in the Oval Office. For all of Trump’s experience and organization, he is still very much the same Donald Trump, and just as intent as before on dominating the center of the national conversation. If not more. He has acted to try to end civil service protections for many federal workers andoverturn more than a century of lawon birthright citizenship. Such moves have been a magnet for legal challenges. In the case of the birthright citizenship order, it met swift criticism from U.S. District Judge John Coughenour, who put a temporary stay on Trump’s plans. “I’ve been on the bench for over four decades. I can’t remember another case where the question presented was as clear as this one is,” Coughenour, who was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan, told a Justice Department attorney. “This is a blatantly unconstitutional order.” How those court cases play out will determine not only the fate of some of Trump’s most controversial actions, but just how far any president can go in pushing an agenda. The president likes to call it “liquid gold.” His main economic assumption is that more oil production by the United States, the Saudis and the rest of OPEC would bring down prices. That would reduce overall inflation and cut down on the oil revenues that Russia is using to fund its war in Ukraine. For Trump, oil is the answer. He’s betting that fossil fuels are the future, despite the climate change risks. “The United States has the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth, and we’re going to use it,” Trump said in a Thursday speech. “Not only will this reduce the cost of virtually all goods and services, it’ll make the United States a manufacturing superpower and the world capital of artificial intelligence and crypto” Trump had theworld’s wealthiest menbehind him on the dais when he took the oath of office on Monday. Tesla’s Elon Musk, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and LVMH’s Bernard Arnault were all there. SoftBank billionaire Masayoshi Son was in the audience. Later in the week, Oracle’s Larry Ellison and OpenAI’s Sam Altman appeared with Son at the White House to announce an artificial intelligence investment of up to $500 billion. Musk, the Trump backer who is leading the president’s Department of Government Efficiency effort, posted on X that SoftBank didn’t have the money. Altman, a rival to to Musk on AI, responded over X that the funding was there. By surrounding himself with the wealthiest people in tech, Trump is also stuck in their drama. “The people in the deal are very, very smart people,” Trump said Thursday. “But Elon, one of the people, he happens to hate. But I have certain hatreds of people, too.” America’s 25th president has a big fan in Trump. Trump likes the tariffs that were imposed during Republican William McKinley’s presidency and helped to fund the government. Trump has claimed the country was its wealthiest in the 1890s when McKinley was in office. But McKinley might not be a great economic role model for the 21st century. For starters, the Tax Foundation found that federal receipts were equal to just 3% of the overall economy in 1900, McKinley’s reelection year. Tax revenues are now equal to about 17% of the U.S. economy and that’s still not enough to fund the government without running massive deficits. So it would be hard to go full McKinley without some chaos. As Dartmouth College economist Douglas Irwin noted on X, the economic era defined by McKinley was not that great for many people. “There was a little something called the Panic of 1893 and the unemployment rate was in double digits from 1894-98!!” Irwin wrote. “Not a great decade!”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

        "title": "Trump fires multiple inspectors general in late-night move",
        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "Conversations about removing these watchdogs began during Trump's transition. In a late-night Friday move, President Donald Trump fired at least 17 independent watchdogs -- known as inspectors general -- at multiple federal agencies, sources familiar with the move told ABC News. The conversations about ousting these government watchdogsbegan during Trump's transitionback to the White House. While inspectors general can be fired by the president — it can only happen after communicating with Congress 30 days in advance and in 2022 Congress strengthened the law requiring administrations to give a detailed reasoning for the firing of an IG. There isn't yet have a complete list of all the IG's impacted, but at least one high-profile watchdog — Justice Department IG Michael Horowitz — did not receive notice that he was fired as of yesterday evening. Horowitz is an Obama appointee and has issued reports that have been critical of both the Trump and Biden administrations. The current law also mandates that any acting IG's must come from within the IG community, though it's unclear whether the Trump White House believes they need to follow that aspect of the law. The inspectors general were blindsided by emails they received Friday night from Sergio Gor, the director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, according to a source with knowledge of the firings. \"I am writing to inform you that due to changing priorities your position ... is terminated, effective immediately,\" read the emails reviewed by ABC News. Many of the IGs had met with Trump transition officials at their agencies and had productive conversations with the incoming administration, the source said. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Saturday that Congress was not given the required 30-day notice. While talking to reporters aboard Air Force One Saturday evening on his way from Las Vegas to Miami, Trump classified the firings as a \"common thing to do.\" \"Well, I did it because it's a very common thing to do – not all of them. Like Horowitz, we're keeping.\" He continued, \"It's a very standard thing to do, very much like the U.S. attorneys.\" \"There may be good reason the IGs were fired. We need to know that if so. I'd like further explanation from President Trump,\" Grassley said in a statement given to ABC News. \"Regardless, the 30 day detailed notice of removal that the law demands was not provided to Congress.\" Grassley told ABC News earlier this week that the president must tell Congress before removal. \"First of all to remind that our Inspector General can't be removed from office until the president, and that's any president, not just Trump. So this is a message to all these presidents you've got to tell Congress a month ahead of time the reasons for removing them,\" Grassley said. He added, \"And the other thing is that inspector generals are expected to be independent of political pressure, independent of the head of the agency, and to make sure that the law is enforced and money spent appropriately, and there shouldn't be any political pressure against any of his work.\" In a letter to the White House Friday, Mike Ware, the Small Business Administration inspector general and chair of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, said the firing of the independent watchdogs over email is not \"legally sufficient to dismiss Presidentially Appointed, Senate confirmed Inspectors General.\" The letter, obtained by ABC News, goes on to explain the removal process codified in the 2022 amendments to the inspectors general law. \"The requirement to provide the substantive rationale, including detailed and case specific reasons, was added to better enable Congress to engage on and respond to a proposed removal of an Inspector General in order to protect the independence of Inspectors General,\" Ware wrote. In floor remarks Saturday morning, Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer ripped into the Trump administration for the move, saying that the dismissals are a possible violation of federal law. \"These firings are Donald Trump's way of telling us he is terrified of accountability and is hostile to facts and to transparency,\" Schumer said. Republican Sen. Joni Ernst launched abipartisan IG caucusjust ten days ago. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the newly-minted group, told ABC News he'll be looking to his Republican colleagues on that panel to take some sort of action. \"We have a group, and it is bipartisan, that is supportive of inspectors general, and I think it is a real test of whether they are willing to let loose an unchecked surge of corruption and waste,\" he said. Reaction among Republican senators was mixed. Texas Sen. John Cornyn deferred to Grassley when asked for comment. \"I think we just take it one step at a time and try to understand what the rationale was,\" he said. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky, said he believes many of the inspectors general do need to be replaced and that Trump ultimately has the power to do so. But he noted there may be a process that needs to be followed. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who helped to pass the legislation in 2022 that strengthened the law requiring administrations to give a detailed reasoning for the firing of an IG, said she was frustrated by Trump's move. \"I don't understand why one would fire individuals whose mission is to root out waste, fraud and abuse,\" Collins said. \"So this leaves a gap in what I know is a priority for President Trump, so I don't understand it.\" Some Republican senators who have been staunch supporters of Trump, however, praised the firings. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said he's \"all for it\" when asked about Trump's move to dismiss the inspectors general. \"We need to clean house. I mean, if they're not for this country to move on down the road,\" he said. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., however, said the firing of the IG's was \"one more example of the lack of respect for the rule of law.\" \"He seems to be trying to throw a monkey wrench into the kind of any independence left in our government,\" Warner said of Trump. \"The whole idea of inspector generals is to have that independent check. Who is going to take those jobs going forward?\" Later Saturday, the ranking Democrats on the House committees sent a letter to Trump strongly condemning the firing of several inspectors general. \"Your actions violate the law, attack our democracy, and undermine the safety of the American people,\" the group wrote. \"Firing inspectors general without due cause is antithetical to good government, undermines the proper stewardship of taxpayer dollars, and degrades the federal government's ability to function effectively and efficiently,\" they added.

        "content": "The 17-year-old allegedly shot two classmates at his Nashville school this week. A teenager who opened fire with a 9 mm pistolin his Nashville high school cafeteriafired a total of 10 shots within 17 seconds of entering the room, according to police. Solomon Henderson, 17, had gone into a bathroom and posted photos to social media just before he went to the cafeteria and opened fire, police said. Henderson shot and killed 16-year-old Josselin Corea Escalante and shot and wounded a 17-year-old boy at Antioch High School around 11 a.m. Wednesday, according to police. Henderson died in the cafeteria from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, police said. The injured boy suffered a graze wound and was treated and released, police said. Authorities are still investigating how Henderson obtained the pistol, Nashville police said Thursday. The gun was purchased in Arizona in 2022 and was not reported stolen, police said. No firearms or firearm parts were found during Wednesday's search of Henderson's home, according to authorities. Authorities are now scouring Henderson's writings and social media presence as they investigate his ideological influences. A Pinterest account linked to Henderson features photos of past school shooters, including the shooters from Parkland, Florida, and Uvalde, Texas, a source told ABC News. Henderson's social media presence also shows he may have been in contact with 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow, whocarried out a shooting at the Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin,last month, according to law enforcement sources. Rupnow, who went by Samantha, also died after the shooting, in which two were killed and several wounded. Rupnow's account may have been following Henderson's account at the time of the Wisconsin shooting in December, according to law enforcement sources. It appears Henderson had two documents on \"non-traditional websites, one 51 pages in length, the other 288 pages,\" police said. The 51-page document expressed violent white supremacist beliefs, sources told ABC News. He expressed self-hatred as a Black person, and he wrote of wishing violence on other Black people. He also expressed violent hatred toward Jews and used antisemitic tropes and conspiracy theories to express his views, according to the sources. Henderson appeared to support neo-Nazi accelerationist and violent incel beliefs and expressed a desire to see genocide committed against racial and religious minorities, according to sources. He belonged to online communities that promote violence and extremism, sources said, and some people in those groups publicly identified Henderson as the school shooter long before his identity was confirmed by authorities.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)                                                       MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — There’s all sorts of ways beyond merely the score to measure just how dominantJannik Sinnerwas while outplaying and frustratingAlexander Zverevduring the 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 victory Sunday that earned the 23-year-old Italian a second consecutiveAustralian Openchampionship.  The zero break points Sinner faced. Or the 10 he accumulated. The 27-13 advantage in points that lasted at least nine strokes. Or the way Sinner accumulated more winners, 32 to 25, and fewer unforced errors, 27 to 45. The way Sinner won 10 of the 13 points that ended with him at the net. Or the way he only let Zverev go 14 of 27 in that category, frequently zipping passing shots out of reach.  Well, here’s is one more bit of evidence: what Zverev said about Sinner.  “I’m serving better than him, but that’s it. He does everything else better than me. He moves better than me. He hits his forehand better than me. He hits his backhand better than me. He returns better than me. He volleys better than me,” Zverev said. “At the end of the day, tennis has five or six massive shots — like, massive factors — and he does four or five of them better than me. That’s the reason why he won.”  High praise from a guy who is, after all, ranked No. 2. Sinner has held the No. 1 spot since last June andis not showing any signs of relinquishing it. This was the first Australian Open final between the men at No. 1 and No. 2 since 2019, whenNo. 1 Novak Djokovic defeated No. 2 Rafael Nadal— also in straight sets.  “It’s amazing,” Sinner said, “to achieve these things.”   The “things” include being the youngest man to leave Melbourne Park with the trophy two years in a row since Jim Courier in 1992-93, and the first man sinceNadalat the French Open in 2005 and 2006 to follow up his firstGrand Slamtitle by repeating as the champion at the same tournament a year later.

(AP Photo/Manish Swarup)   Sinner was asked later whether he felt more relief or excitement when he raised his arms after the last point was his.  “This one was joy. We managed to do something incredible this time, because the situation I was in was completely different from a year ago here,” he said. “I had more pressure.”  Probably true, but’s hard to tell.  Go to the start of 2024, and take stock. In that span, Sinner has won three of the five major tournaments, including the U.S. Open in September, meaning he now has claimed three straight hard-court Slams. His record is 80-6 with nine titles. His current unbeaten run covers 21 matches.  “There’s always something that can get better,” said one of his two coaches, Simone Vagnozzi. “He is playing really well right now and everything comes easily. But there will be tough moments ahead.”  The only thing that’s clouded the past 12 months for Sinner, it seems,is the doping casein which his exoneration was appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency. He tested positive for a trace amount of an anabolic steroid twice last March but blamed it on an accidental exposure involving two members of his team who have since been fired. Sinner initially was cleared in August; ahearing in the WADA appealis scheduled for April.  “I keep playing like this because I have a clear mind on what happened,” Sinner said Sunday. “I know if I would be guilty, I would not play like this.”  While he became the eighth man in the Open era (which began in 1968) to start his career 3-0 in Grand Slam finals,Zverev is the seventh to be 0-3, adding this loss to those at the 2020 U.S. Open and last year’s French Open.  Those earlier setbacks both came in five sets. This contest was not that close. Not at all.  “I’ll keep doing everything I can,” Zverev said, “to lift one of those trophies.”  Just beforeZverev began speakinginto a microphone during the trophy ceremony, a voice cried out from the stands, making reference to two of the player’s ex-girlfriends whoaccused him of physical abuse.  During the match, there truly was only one moment that contained a hint of tension. It came when Zverev was two points from owning the second set at 5-4, love-30. But a break point — and a set point — never arrived.  A year ago, Sinner went through a lot more trouble to earn his first major, needing to get past Novak Djokovic —who quit one set into his semifinalagainst Zverev on Friday because of a torn hamstring — beforeerasing a two-set deficit in the finalagainst 2021 U.S. Open champion Daniil Medvedev.  This time, Sinner applied pressure with an all-around style that does not really appear to have holes.  He proved superior in every meaningful way other than aces, leaving Zverev shaking his head or trudging to the sideline with shoulders sagging or cracking his racket against the court or against another racket.  Perfectly understandable, given what Sinner can do to an opponent, especially on a hard court.  “The facts speak for themselves,” Zverev said. “He’s in a different universe right now.”   Howard Fendrich has been the AP’s tennis writer since 2002.

(AP Photo/John Raoux)     DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Roger Penske started his 59th season in motorsports the same way he closed last year — as a champion. Porsche Penske Motorsport on Sunday won the Rolex 24 at Daytona for the second consecutive year, and third time overall, to continue the domination “The Captain” flexed all of last season. Penske opened 2024 by winning the most prestigious sports car race in North America, added a 20th victory in the Indianapolis 500, won a second consecutive NASCAR championship and his pair of Porsches won both the World Endurance Championship title and the IMSA crown. Now back at Daytona International Speedway for the Rolex, the same place and race where Team Penske debuted in 1966, Penske returned to victory lane. And, as he always does, the billionaire who turns 88 next month stayed awake and sat with the team on the timing stand for the entire 24 hours. His two cars dominated the twice-round-the-clock endurance race and finished 1-2. Once attrition hit other entries in the top prototype class, the Porsches ran first and second for large portions of the race. It was the No. 7 full-time IMSA entry that won, making it back-to-back victories for that car despite a different driver lineup. Felipe Nasr won last year with Dane Cameron and Josef Newgarden, but Cameron was let go at the end of 2024 and Newgarden wasn’t part of this year’s Rolex lineup. So it was Nasr again, only this time he was paired with Nick Tandy, who will be his IMSA co-driver all season, and Laurens Vanthoor, Penske’s reigning WEC champion.  It was Nasr’s second overall victory, and he also won a Rolex watch for a class victory in 2022. Tandy also earned a Rolex with a 2014 class victory, but Sunday was his first overall win. It was the first watch for Vanthoor, who had finished in the top five of class in six of the last seven years. Nasr said it is Penske who pushes the team to achieve the excellence he demands. “The feeling is amazing, just to see how much energy he brings into the team. You get out of the car, he’s like: ‘How’s the car? How’s the handling?’ Like, he’s very interested in every detail,” Nasr said. “He doesn’t miss a pit stop when the cars are coming in, and he’s looking at it all and making comments. I just have a lot of admiration for everything he does, and it stands for the team. It’s a very, very unique opportunity to be driving for Porsche Penske Motorsport here.” Even though the No. 7 was so dominant — especially after sunrise on Sunday — the drivers were still challenged until the checkered flag. Penske’s No. 6 car took the lead with just under an hour to go, but Nasr bested Matt Campbell in a drag race through traffic to cycle back to the front with about 22 minutes remaining. BMW M Team RLL had a pair of competitive entries and one of its cars went wheel-to-wheel with Nasr for the lead with about 100 minutes remaining. Getting the win Sunday meant beating 60 other cars in a field of 235 drivers representing 31 countries. The lineups included 14 former Formula 1 drivers, including Nasr. Kevin Magnussen, who concluded his 10-year F1 career in December, has the most recent experience in motorsports’ elite global series and was a contender with BMW for overall victory. Rahal’s two cars led and contended with the Porsches but had issues that prevented them from keeping consistent pace with the Penske entries. Same for Meyer Shank Racing, which had a suspension issue early Saturday that took one car out of contention, then its second car suffered front damage when Felix Rosenqvist was leading. All three Cadillacs in the prototype class had issues — one of Wayne Taylor Racing’s entries was knocked out of the race Saturday night not long after two-time Rolex winner Kamui Kobayashi had driven it to the lead.

        "content": "Tom Homan spoke with ABC's Martha Raddatz for \"This Week.\" The Trump administration is planning to use military aircraft every day to help carry out what PresidentDonald Trumpand his \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, have promised will be the largest deportation operation in U.S. history, Homan told ABC News. In an interview with ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz, Homan said that only days after Trump took office, the U.S. government for the first time ever used military aircraft to transport migrants back to their home country, and it will now be a daily occurrence. According to U.S. officials, the U.S. military on Thursday flew more than 150 migrants to Guatemala on two separate flights. But Homan made clear that the military flights are just one part of a much broader plan. He claimed that – unlike under the Biden administration –Immigrationand Customs Enforcement officers are now free to arrest any of the estimated more than 11 million immigrants in the country without legal status, not just those identified as priorities for deportation for being convicted criminals or other public safety threats. Watch more of Martha Raddatz' interview with Tom Homan Sunday on ABC's 'This Week' \"If you're in the country illegally, you're on the table because it's not okay to, you know, violate the laws of this country,\" he said. Homan said that while the Trump administration's enforcement actions are currently prioritizing public safety and national security threats, they're going to \"open up the aperture\" in the weeks and months ahead. \"As that aperture opens, there'll be more arrests nationwide,\" he said. Homan also offered another possible solution for \"those who are in the country illegally\": They \"should leave\" on their own, he said. Early in the Biden administration, then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas issued guidance to immigration enforcement officers discouraging them from \"spending resources to remove those who do not pose a threat\" and noting that many undocumented immigrants inside the country \"have been here for generations and contributed to our country's well-being,\" as he put it in a statement at the time. Homan, however, noted that the nation’s immigration laws were passed by Congress to be enforced, and said immigrants without legal status are violating those laws. More of Homan's interview with Raddatz will air Sunday on \"This Week.\" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(AP Photo/Marta Lavandier)           Dearica Hamby still smiles at the memory of Kobe Bryant sitting courtside at WNBA games. She had met him years ago. He came to see her old team, the Las Vegas Aces, play all the time. “I think one of the first things he told me was that I could play defense,” Hamby recalled. “And I was kind of like ‘Wha-at?’ ... That’s something I’ll cherish with me forever.” That epitomized the late NBA great’s relationship with the women’s game. After his 20-year playing career ended, Bryant turned his focus to the next generation, mentoring some of women’s basketball’s biggest stars, from WNBA champion and Olympic gold medalist Diana Taurasi to former Oregon star Sabrina Ionescu. He worked out with them, analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of their game and pushed for them to reach the same heights in popularity that he and his NBA peers did. For Hamby, now with the Los Angeles Sparks, Bryant saw an aspect of her game she didn’t even know she had. “If Kobe tells you you can play defense, you can play defense,” she quipped. Five years after Bryant, 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven otherswere killed in a helicopter crashin Calabasas, California, several women’s basketball players reflected on what he meant to their game and how he championed it. Many of them thought Bryant would be pleased with the overall progress of women’s sports, which haveskyrocketed in popularity and reachin recent years. That growth has been most prominent in the women’s basketball arenas that Bryant and Gianna loved so much.  The WNBA last season had its most-watched regular season in 24 years and its best attendance in 22 seasons. Some of the league’s most popular players currently are competing in a new3-on-3 leaguein South Florida called Unrivaled, founded by Olympic gold medalists Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart. “We carry this on for him,” said Satou Sabally, a forward with the WNBA’s Dallas Wings who plays for the Phantom squad in Unrivaled. “He would be so proud of this league. He would be proud of ’Phe and Stewie. I know that he’s looking down and hopefully he’s smiling and is proud of us.” Sabally said she still gets emotional when she thinks of that day on Jan. 26, 2020. It reminds her of her playing days at Oregon, when she, Ionescu and their Ducks teammates connected over Bryant. “I think about ... how we all bonded together over Kobe and how we bonded together for the rest of our lives because he was so impactful,” Sabally added. “He was really a person that saw us women as the talents who we are. He came to the games, he was so outspoken and he really was really supportive.” The shock of the superstar’s death echoed throughout the sports and entertainment worlds, with many taking to social media to post emotional tributes to Bryant while expressing their disbelief. People were glued to their phones and TV screens as news of the crash spread. NBA players were in tears ahead of games that day. “I still remember exactly where I was whenever we heard the news,” said Kate Martin of the Golden State Valkyries, playing for Laces BC at Unrivaled, “and no one really knew if it was fake or real. I think that’s just one of those things where you’re just always going to remember exactly where you were when you heard that.” Martin never met Bryant but said she cherishes his mentality — he had a relentless competitiveness — and the way he elevated women’s sports. Bryant became heavily involved with his daughters’ hoops journeys and coached Gianna’s youth team. He was often at women’s basketball games, especially college ones, with Gianna, who was fascinated with the UConn Huskies. Gianna was in line to further Bryant’s legacy on the court. The plan was for her to attend Connecticut, and surely the WNBA was next. Bryant was passionate about women’s sports despite the belief of some that he should not have been involved with the women’s game at all because of a 2003 charge accusing him of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old employee at a Colorado resort. Bryant had said the two had consensual sex, and the charge was eventually dropped when the woman declined to testify at trial. The woman later filed a civil suit against Bryant that was settled out of court. There’s an image that still circulates in the sports world today: Kobe and Gianna sitting courtside at a 2019 game featuring his Los Angeles Lakers. He wore a bright orange pullover with a white WNBA logo on the front. Gianna sat beaming at his side. “I think a lot of people started to follow behind Kobe because he recognized our gift and our talent and how special it really is,” said former Chicago Sky head coach Teresa Weatherspoon, the current coach of Unrivaled’s Vinyl BC. “And his daughter was right there as well.” That’s who Bryant had become — a face of women’s sports advocacy. “He’s greatly missed,” Martin said. “But now his legacy will live on forever.” AP WNBA:https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

The government is consulting on whether to let tech firms use copyrighted material to help train artificial intelligence models unless the creators explicitly opt out. McCartney told the BBC that would make it harder for artists to retain control of their work and undermine Britain’s creative industries. “You get young guys, girls, coming up, and they write a beautiful song, and they don’t own it, and they don’t have anything to do with it. And anyone who wants can just rip it off,” the 82-year-oldformer Beatlesaid in an interview to be broadcast Sunday. An extract was released Saturday by the BBC. “The truth is, the money’s going somewhere. When it gets on the streaming platforms, somebody is getting it, and it should be the person who created it. It shouldn’t be some tech giant somewhere.” Britain’s center-leftLabour Party governmentsays it wants to make the U.K. a world leader in AI. In December, it announced a consultation into how copyright law can “enable creators and right holders to exercise control over, and seek remuneration for, the use of their works for AI training” while also ensuring “AI developers have easy access to a broad range of high-quality creative content.” Publishers, artists’ organizations and media companies, including The Associated Press, have banded together as the Creative Rights in AI Coalition to oppose weakening copyright protections. “We’re the people, you’re the government. You’re supposed to protect us. That’s your job,” McCartney said. “So you know, if you’re putting through a bill, make sure you protect the creative thinkers, the creative artists, or you’re not going to have them.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "Researchers say they are puzzled over the discovery. Astronomers have detected fast-repeating radio bursts from a distant \"dead\" galaxy that should not contain the energy to produce these types of signals, according to new research. The source of the fast radio bursts (FRBs) -- sudden flashes of radio waves that last just milliseconds -- has previously been linked to young, magnetized neutron stars that expend a lot of energy when they are forming. But the dormant galaxy from which these radio bursts are originating should not contain this type of young star, according to a paper published Wednesday inThe Astrophysical Journal Letters. Researchers expect FRBs to originate inside of a galaxy and, because these FRBs are so energetic, within a region of a galaxy in which new stars are actively forming, Vishwangi Shah, a PhD student in the Department of Physics and the Trottier Space Institute at McGill University, told ABC News. These FRBs, named FRB 20240209A, are located outside of the massive ancient elliptical galaxy it is associated with that only contains old and dead stars, Shah said. \"This discovery was really surprising and exciting,\" she said. Shah and her team used the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment -- also known as the CHIME telescope -- to detect the multiple bursts from the same location, Shah said. But because the CHIME telescope could not pinpoint the exact location of the radio waves, they combined it with a smaller CHIME-like telescope to pinpoint the location of the FRB. They then used the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii to image the region around the location of the FRBs. The Gemini image confirmed that there is no other galaxy present near the FRB and the FRB is indeed associated with the dead galaxy. \"There's no other galaxy there,\" Shah said. The ancient elliptical galaxy where astronomers discovered the radio waves is about 2 billion light-years from Earth and is about 11.3 billion years old, according to the paper. Thousands of radio bursts have been recorded since 2007, when they were first discovered by astronomers, Shah said, adding that they only know the precise locations of about 100 of them -- all near actively forming stars. \"This particular FRB is really an outlier, and it challenges our theories about what is producing FRBs,\" Shah said. Astronomers hypothesize that the FRBs could be originating from two supernova remnants, called neutron stars, that are merging or collapsing onto themselves, Shah said. Continuing to study these FRBs will allow researchers to further understand the space between its origination and the Milky Way as well as what is happening in distant regions of space, Shah said. \"That is why it is a really useful probe of our universe,\" she said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

In an interview with AP entertainment journalist Krysta Fauria, the pair discussed working with an intimacy coordinator, Luca Guadagnino’s directing style — and the legacy of Beat Generation writer and “Queer” author William S. Burroughs.  Country music comes naturally to Ringo Starr. The former Beatle has dabbled in the music ever since singing the country hit “Act Naturally” with the Beatles in 1965, and he’s now about to release a whole country album. Starr says in an interview with The Associated Press’ Andrew Dalton that he’s put a bit of country in most everything he’s done, so the album wasn’t too big a stretch. Starr says the project began when he bumped into his friend, classic country aficionado T-Bone Burnett, and asked him to write a song. Burnett came back with nine. The resulting album, “Look Up,” comes out in January.  Erykah Badu has been a music disruptor, culture shifter and style maven ever since she stepping into the limelight with her 1997 debut album, “Baduizm.” The four-time Grammy winner, who was recently honored with the CFDA (Council of Fashion Designers of America) Icon award, sat down with AP entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton to talk about her fashion influence, working on new music, her appearance in “The Piano Lesson” —and finally learning to stop and smell the flowers.

Tim Heidecker is working through his existential dread, in the form of song. Best known for his absurdist comedy, he’s leaned more into songwriting in recent years. He sat down with AP entertainment journalist Krysta Fauria to talk about his latest album “Slipping Away,” which moves between semi-fictional apocalyptic storytelling and poignant, vulnerable reflections on fatherhood, aging and success.  Mikey Madison stars in “Anora” as a Brooklyn exotic dancer who spontaneously marries the son of a Russian oligarch. She sat down with AP entertainment journalist Krysta Fauria to talk about how she landed the role with writer-director Sean Baker, preparing her little brother for a screening, improv — and the challenge of pole dancing.  Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh star in John Crowley’s “We Live In Time,” which tells the story of a relationship over the course of a decade. The two actors sat down with AP film writer Jake Coyle to talk about on-screen chemistry, processing the heavier moments of the film — and that infamous carousel horse meme.  N.T. Rama Rao Jr. is following up the international success of “RRR” with the action-drama “Devara: Part 1,” in which he plays both a mythical hero and a son struggling with his dad’s legacy. Rama Rao says Los Angeles has become his “lucky charm” after last year’s trip to the Oscars — where “Naatu Naatu” won best song — and a subsequent invitation to join the U.S. film academy. The 41-year-old, whose father and grandfather were both prominent actors and political leaders, sat down with AP entertainment editor Ryan Pearson to talk about his own perspective on fatherhood, filming crowd-pleasing underwater scenes, staying “innocent” as an actor — and his love for the Will Smith film “The Pursuit of Happiness.”  RZA’s hoarding habit led to his newest adventure in music: a ballet and surprisingly traditional classical music album he calls “A Ballet Through Mud.” He sat down with AP entertainment editor Ryan Pearson to talk about the nostalgic genesis of the project, the growing bridge between the worlds of classical and hip-hop, and his hopes for what happens next with his composition and ballet.  After releasing 18 albums over more than two decades, Xiu Xiu is still making music for outsiders. With the release of “13'’ Frank Beltrame Italian Stiletto with Bison Horn Grips,” band leader Jamie Stewart spoke with AP entertainment journalist Krysta Fauria about balancing harmony and dissonance, moving to Berlin — and why the band “wouldn’t exist” without David Lynch’s “Twin Peaks” universe.

She sat down with AP film writer Lindsey Bahr to talk about creating a new voice for her Lee/Harley Quinn character, writing a “waltz that falls apart” for the film — and why it’s an “exciting time” in pop music. Phillips shares why he chose her for the role, singing on set — and using the film to pose the question: “What is entertainment?”  Angelina Jolie portrays renowned opera singer Maria Callas in Pablo Larraín’s “Maria,” focusing on her life in Paris in the 70s before her death at age 53. They sat down with AP entertainment editor Louise Dixon at the Venice Film Festival to discuss how Jolie connected with Callas, the difficulty of performing opera — and why the film, to be released on Netflix, is the most personal of Larraín’s biopic trilogy that includes “Spencer” and “Jackie.”  Nearly a decade after his last full-length release, Zedd is releasing “Telos.” The Grammy-winning producer/DJ says he needed to push himself to make an album that would move the needle — one that told a story beyond the success of his debut LP, “Clarity,” or “True Colors.” The German dance-pop maverick says the album — which features collaborators ranging from Muse and John Mayer to Remi Wolf and Bea Miller — is “an album that for many years I doubted I could create.” He spoke with AP entertainment journalist Rick Taber about the long process of creating “Telos,” being inspired by Jeff Buckley and the state of EDM.  “Only Murders in the Building” has become a “safe place” for Selena Gomez as the hit Hulu comedy enters its fourth season.

The reality competition series’ stars Johnny “Bananas” Devenanzio, Aneea Ferreira and Nurys Mateo — along with host TJ Lavin — sat down with AP entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton to talk about the 40th season, which features 40 returning competitors in a “Battle of the Eras.”  Michael Keaton says it would have been a “huge mistake” for his titular trickster ghost character to get significantly more screen time in “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” than he did in the first film. The 72-year-old star sat down with AP entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton to talk about why he was nervous to return for the sequel featuring Jenna Ortega and Winona Ryder, the impact of Tim Burton’s original 1988 horror comedy — and why he never thought of himself as playing Batman.  Justin Baldoni’s “It Ends With Us” journey began well before Colleen Hoover’s novel became a sensation on TikTok. The 40-year-old actor and filmmaker optioned the book in 2019 while he was shooting “Jane The Virgin” and preparing to release his feature film directorial debut, “Five Feet Apart.” Five years later, he spoke with AP entertainment journalist Alicia Rancilio about directing and co-starring alongside Blake Lively in the drama that revolves around domestic violence.

On his third album, “Stampede,” his nonconformist spirit has led to collaborations with everyone from Willie Nelson and Elton John to Mickey Guyton and Kylie Minogue. The 36-year-old South African musician has been steadily stripping back his mask since his 2019 debut album “Pony.” Peck spoke with AP music journalist Maria Sherman about his growing confidence, his high-profile collaborations and country radio.  Josh Hartnett is looking back at shedding his Hollywood heartthrob image in the 2000s as he stars in M. Night Shyamalan’s thriller “Trap.” Hartnett is now 46 and lives in England with his wife and four children. While he’s been working steadily since breaking out in 1998 with a “Halloween” sequel and “The Faculty,” he intentionally moved away from studio movies and leading man roles after being typecast as his fame grew with movies like “Black Hawk Down” and “Pearl Harbor.” In “Trap,” Hartnett plays a father with a secret who takes his daughter to a pop concert — which is surrounded by police searching for a serial killer.  M. Night Shyamalan has been at least partly self-financing his films since 2015’s “The Visit,” risking his own money on box office success. His latest is “Trap,” starring Josh Hartnett as a father with a secret and Shyamalan’s daughter Saleka as a pop star whose concert is surrounded by police looking to capture a serial killer. Shyamalan spoke with AP entertainment editor Ryan Pearson about his high-risk, high-reward, lower-budget filmmaking approach, guiding his daughters’ artistic pursuits — and his philosophy that “talent is process.”  Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)           DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — From activists on the far right toElon Musk, allies of PresidentDonald Trumphave been quick to threaten primary challengers for Republican senators who don’t back hisCabinet picksand legislative priorities. In the case of Iowa’s Joni Ernst, conservatives threatened to run against her if she didn’t backTrump’s pick for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth— before she announced she would. Louisiana’s Bill Cassidy, a doctor before entering politics, is being closely watched for how he will questionRobert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s nominee for health secretary South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham, a Trump confidant, has long been targeted by the far right in his state and was booed at a home-state rally during the 2024 presidential campaign. The Associated Press talked to people connected to five senators who have been targeted online or by rivals in their states. Here’s a look at each of their potential races and what they face: Ernst prompted criticism from the right after she initially stopped short of endorsing Hegseth, who wasconfirmed by the Senateon Friday. Ernst voted “yes.” A retired Iowa National Guard lieutenant colonel and Iraq War veteran, Ernst is also a sexual assault survivor. After Trump announced Hegseth’s nomination, she said she hoped to discuss with him comments that he had made opposing women serving in combat roles, and about an allegation, which he denied and was not charged for, that he sexually assaulted a woman he met at a 2017 conference.  Hegseth, at Ernst’s suggestion, affirmed that that “every man and woman has opportunity to serve their country in uniform and to do so at any level as long as they are meeting the standards that are set forward.” Hegseth also said that if confirmed, he would appoint a senior-level official dedicated to sexual assault prevention and response. Potential challengers to Ernst: Conservative media figure Steve Deace, who posted on Facebook in December that “I don’t want to be a Senator, but I am willing to primary her for the good of the cause.” Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird wrote in a December opinion piece in Breitbart that some unnamed “D.C. politicians” thought “they can ignore the voices of their constituents and entertain smears” from news media outlets. That prompted speculation that Bird, who endorsed Trump before the 2024 Iowa caucuses, might challenge Ernst, who stayed neutral beforehand. Charlie Kirk of the conservative group Turning Point also called for Ernst to face a primary. An effort to boost Hegseth’s nomination led to Ernst’s office receiving thousands of calls. Cause for concern: Neither Deace nor Bird has taken any public steps toward running. Some prominent social conservatives are bothered by Ernst’s joining with a dozen Republicans and the Senate’s Democratic majority in 2022 to support repealing the Defense of Marriage Act to recognize the validity of same-sex marriages. But she remains popular with Iowa’s power players. “Anyone who says with a straight face that they are going to beat Joni Ernst in a primary today is kidding themselves,” said Luke Martz, an Iowa Republican consultant. “It would be a fool’s errand.” Tillis angered some on the right for not immediately supporting Trump’s first pick for attorney general, former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz. Though Gaetz withdrew from consideration, Tillis remains a frustration to some among North Carolina’s right wing, in part for voting to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act. Potential challengers: Andy Nilsson, a onetime candidate for lieutenant governor, has filed paperwork to challenge Tillis. The retired businessman has called for a return to the Reagan-Bush Republican ethos, hardly an attack from the right. Tillis faced three Republican challengers in 2020, all posing as more conservative than him. Cause for concern: Tillis has reason to expect a right-wing challenge. That faction helped lift former Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson to the 2024 nomination for governor last year. But North Carolina is expected to be among the most competitive states for Senate Republicans to hold in 2026. Roy Cooper, a Democrat who just finished two terms as governor, has not ruled out running for the seat. National Republicans are aware of the risks of nominating someone too far to the right. Cooper’s Democratic successor, Gov. Josh Stein, beat Robinson by nearly 15 percentage points in a state that Trump won by 3 points. To that end, Trump’s team and Tillis have been working together behind the scenes, said former Gov. Pat McCrory, a fellow Republican. “I anticipate there will be threats of challenging him from the right. But I also think he’ll deal with it as he has, with hard work and a record of accomplishment,” McCrory said. “I think the incoming administration sees that.” “They also see he’s the best chance of keeping North Carolina red,” he added. Cassidy remains vulnerable in large part due to his vote to convict Trump after his second impeachment over the siege of the U.S. Capitol. “Our Constitution and our country is more important than any one person. I voted to convict President Trump because he is guilty,” Cassidy said in a statement after the February 2021 vote. Cassidy, in his second term, has not yet announced whether he will seek a third. A gastroenterologist before he entered politics, Cassidy will be closely watched for how he votes on Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic who has questioned medical consensus on several issues. Potential challengers: Cassidy has already drawn a Republican challenger, state Treasurer John Fleming. Fleming, a former U.S. House member from northern Louisiana, has said Cassidy’s impeachment vote “failed” Louisiana. Former U.S. Rep. Garrett Graves of Baton Rouge is also a potential challenger, as is Blake Miguez, a state senator from New Iberia. Louisiana last year did away with its 50-year tradition of “jungle primaries,” where candidates from all parties ran in the same contest in November. Cassidy would now run in a closed Republican primary that might be more difficult if he faces one strong Trump-aligned challenger. Cause for concern: Cassidy’s vote to convict Trump remains a sticking point for Republicans in a state the president won with 60% last year. But Cassidy is viewed as having strong constituent relations and visibility in the state, political observers say. “Aside from that vote, I think he’s considered a good senator, and good at constituent work,” said Ellen Carmichael, a Louisiana Republican consultant and president of Washington-based Lafayette Company. “The base is unhappy with the vote he cast. But I wouldn’t count him out.” Cornyn in the past has been criticized within his own party for being too willing to work with Democrats and has drawn boos at GOP conventions in Texas. Commentator Tucker Carlson and others have urged a primary challenge against him. Last year, Cornyn told the Dallas Morning News that, “God willing,” he would seek reelection in 2026. According to federal filings, Cornyn had more than $3.5 million on hand in toward the end of 2024. Potential challengers: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is one of the state’s most powerful Republicans and also suggested Cornyn should be primaried. Paxton was acquitted in a 2023 impeachment effort and fraud charges against him were dropped last year. Cornyn and Paxton have sniped at each other on X, with Paxton calling Cornyn “anti-Trump” and “anti-gun” and the senator firing back, “Hard to run from prison, Ken.” Cause for concern: Brendan Steinhauser, a Republican strategist who has worked on Cornyn’s previous campaigns, noted that the senator remains undefeated in elections. “He’s never taken a race for granted. I would expect him to work extremely hard and crisscross the state of Texas to earn every vote possible in this upcoming election, assuming he has a primary challenger,” Steinhauser said. “I think it’s important for him to show the ways that he has worked with President Trump to enact the conservative America First agenda, and I would expect that would be a big part of his campaign message in a potential upcoming primary.” Seeking his fifth term, Graham will likely face primary challenges — he always has. County-level Republican parties have censured him a number of times for his willingness to work on bipartisan deals. One such measure derided Graham’s “condescending attitude” to the party’s grassroots organizers. He has even drawn boos at some events of the party faithful in his home state. That includes aJuly 2023 Trump rallyin Pickens — in the county where Graham grew up — where objections from the crowd drowned out more than five minutes of his remarks. When he took the stage, Trump also elicited boos when he mentioned Graham’s name. Graham has named a campaign leadership team, which says he has more than $15 million on hand, including nearly $1 million raised in the final quarter of 2024. Potential challengers: Rep. Ralph Norman represents South Carolina’s 5th Congressional District south of Charlotte, North Carolina, and is a member of the House Freedom Caucus. Another possible opponent could be Adam Morgan, a former South Carolina legislator who lost a primary bid last year against another congressman, Rep. William Timmons. Cause for concern: While he was highly critical of Trump in 2016 when they competed for the Republican nomination, Graham has backed Trump ever since his first administration, frequently serving as his golf partner and Capitol Hill surrogate. Trump has backed him in turn. When the crowd in Pickens booed Graham’s name, Trump said he was “going to have to work on these people” and added that Graham is “there when you need him.” Kinnard reported from Washington.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)              LAS VEGAS (AP) — PresidentDonald Trumpcame to Las Vegas on Saturday to crow about his campaign promise to eliminate taxes on tips, signaling to allies in Congress the importance of the policy but stopping well short of offering details for making the slogan a reality. Instead, Trump spent most of his 40 minutes speaking to roughly 1,000 supporters in a casino ballroom lauding his November election victory, mocking former President Joe Biden’s administration and touting his torrent of executive actions since taking office Monday. “But I have to be honest with you, I’m really here for a different reason, I’m here to say thank you,” Trump told the crowd at Circa Resort & Casino. The victory lap, Trump’s first swing-state rally since taking office, came after he won Nevada’s six electoral votes in November, becoming the first Republican since George W. Bush in 2004 to carry the state. It was part of Trump’s sweep of all seven of the most competitive states that gave him a healthy electoral majority and a second, non-consecutive term. AP correspondent Julie Walker reports President Trump leans into his pledge to eliminate taxes on tips. Aides said Trump’s stop in Nevada was to deliver an “economic-focused message” built around his familiar promise to hospitality industry workers to remove the tax on gratuity income. “We’re going to get it for you — ‘no tax on tips,’” Trump said, standing behind a podium emblazoned with the same slogan he used throughout the 2024 campaign.  After the rally, Trump strode through the Circa casino floor past its purple-hewed velvet tables, to cheers from visitors of “USA, USA.” At a roulette table, a player yelled, “Give me $47 on 47,” for Trump, now the 47th president. “Ohh,” Trump lamented at the losing throw but he signed autographs as supporters hooted. If light on detail, Trump’s comments on tips were a signal to Republicans in Congress that the proposal is a priority for the massive tax package they intend to pass this year. Trump is set to meet House Republicans on Monday as they gather in Florida to chart the strategy ahead. Speaker Mike Johnson, who is laboring to get the package moving forward, invited Trump to address a joint session of Congress on March 4, a tradition for new presidents, who don’t deliver a State of the Union address until their second year in office. Johnson said lawmakers working with Trump hope to make the next four years “some of the most consequential in our nation’s history.” Nevada is a familiar backdrop to talk tips and taxation. As a candidate, Trump first announced the idea of ending gratuity taxes during a rally in June in Las Vegas — aproposal later copiedby his Democratic opponent,Kamala Harris. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates there are 2.24 million restaurant servers across the country, with tips making up a large percentage of their income. In Las Vegas, the 24-hour economy is fueled by everyone from wait staff and valet parkers to hotel maids and casino dealers, all of whom collect tips. Nevada has the nation’s highest concentration of tipped workers, with about 25.8 waiters and waitresses alone per 1,000 jobs, followed by Hawaii and Florida. Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer for the Culinary Union, which represents about 60,000 hospitality workers across Nevada, said Trump’s plans “must not end” with scrapping taxation on tips. “Eliminating taxes on tips and ending the $2.13 sub-minimum wage — that is the reality in too many states across the country — will uplift millions of hospitality workers,” Pappageorge said. He said many employers set hourly pay well below the federal minimum wage and expect gratuities to make up the difference. Despite the stated focus on taxes, the Nevada rally served mostly as a capstone of sorts to Trump’s first week in office, as he recounted for the crowd the executive orders he’d signed and what they’ll do. “We’ve accomplished more in one week than most administrations have experienced in four years and we’re just getting started,” Trump said, adding that his executive orders “reverse the horrible failures and betrayals that we inherited from a group of people that didn’t know what the hell they were doing.” Trump cited a sweeping freeze on new money for all U.S. foreign assistance, his notice of a U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and his order ceasing diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the federal government, among other things. “We feel a light over our country,” Trump said. ”Everyone does.” Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

Bridgestone said the closure will help the company “optimize its business footprint” and “strengthen its competitiveness.” In addition, Bridgestone announced capacity and workforce reductions at its Des Moines, Iowa, agriculture tire plant and additional workforce reductions in U.S. corporate, sales and operations. In Latin America, it plans reductions in workforce and production capacity in Argentina and Brazil. “Reductions in force are impacting our corporate, sales and operations in the Americas where a realignment of staffing levels is needed in response to the challenging economic environment,” company spokesperson Emily Weaver said in an email. “Of our nearly 44,000 teammates across North America and Latin America, just under 4% of our teammates are leaving the company as part of the voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions.” The LaVergne plant was the first tire-producing facility in North America for the Bridgestone Corporation. The company stopped making tires for cars and light trucks at the plant in 2009, laying off roughly half of the workers at the time. LaVergne's United Steelworkers master union workers have preferential hiring rights at the company's plants in Des Moines; Akron, Ohio; and Russellville, Arkansas, Weaver said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "title": "Trump fires multiple inspectors general in late-night move",
        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "Conversations about removing these watchdogs began during Trump's transition. In a late-night Friday move, President Donald Trump fired at least 17 independent watchdogs -- known as inspectors general -- at multiple federal agencies, sources familiar with the move told ABC News. The conversations about ousting these government watchdogsbegan during Trump's transitionback to the White House. While inspectors general can be fired by the president — it can only happen after communicating with Congress 30 days in advance and in 2022 Congress strengthened the law requiring administrations to give a detailed reasoning for the firing of an IG. There isn't yet have a complete list of all the IG's impacted, but at least one high-profile watchdog — Justice Department IG Michael Horowitz — did not receive notice that he was fired as of yesterday evening. Horowitz is an Obama appointee and has issued reports that have been critical of both the Trump and Biden administrations. The current law also mandates that any acting IG's must come from within the IG community, though it's unclear whether the Trump White House believes they need to follow that aspect of the law. The inspectors general were blindsided by emails they received Friday night from Sergio Gor, the director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, according to a source with knowledge of the firings. \"I am writing to inform you that due to changing priorities your position ... is terminated, effective immediately,\" read the emails reviewed by ABC News. Many of the IGs had met with Trump transition officials at their agencies and had productive conversations with the incoming administration, the source said. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Saturday that Congress was not given the required 30-day notice. While talking to reporters aboard Air Force One Saturday evening on his way from Las Vegas to Miami, Trump classified the firings as a \"common thing to do.\" \"Well, I did it because it's a very common thing to do – not all of them. Like Horowitz, we're keeping.\" He continued, \"It's a very standard thing to do, very much like the U.S. attorneys.\" \"There may be good reason the IGs were fired. We need to know that if so. I'd like further explanation from President Trump,\" Grassley said in a statement given to ABC News. \"Regardless, the 30 day detailed notice of removal that the law demands was not provided to Congress.\" Grassley told ABC News earlier this week that the president must tell Congress before removal. \"First of all to remind that our Inspector General can't be removed from office until the president, and that's any president, not just Trump. So this is a message to all these presidents you've got to tell Congress a month ahead of time the reasons for removing them,\" Grassley said. He added, \"And the other thing is that inspector generals are expected to be independent of political pressure, independent of the head of the agency, and to make sure that the law is enforced and money spent appropriately, and there shouldn't be any political pressure against any of his work.\" In a letter to the White House Friday, Mike Ware, the Small Business Administration inspector general and chair of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, said the firing of the independent watchdogs over email is not \"legally sufficient to dismiss Presidentially Appointed, Senate confirmed Inspectors General.\" The letter, obtained by ABC News, goes on to explain the removal process codified in the 2022 amendments to the inspectors general law. \"The requirement to provide the substantive rationale, including detailed and case specific reasons, was added to better enable Congress to engage on and respond to a proposed removal of an Inspector General in order to protect the independence of Inspectors General,\" Ware wrote. In floor remarks Saturday morning, Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer ripped into the Trump administration for the move, saying that the dismissals are a possible violation of federal law. \"These firings are Donald Trump's way of telling us he is terrified of accountability and is hostile to facts and to transparency,\" Schumer said. Republican Sen. Joni Ernst launched abipartisan IG caucusjust ten days ago. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the newly-minted group, told ABC News he'll be looking to his Republican colleagues on that panel to take some sort of action. \"We have a group, and it is bipartisan, that is supportive of inspectors general, and I think it is a real test of whether they are willing to let loose an unchecked surge of corruption and waste,\" he said. Reaction among Republican senators was mixed. Texas Sen. John Cornyn deferred to Grassley when asked for comment. \"I think we just take it one step at a time and try to understand what the rationale was,\" he said. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky, said he believes many of the inspectors general do need to be replaced and that Trump ultimately has the power to do so. But he noted there may be a process that needs to be followed. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who helped to pass the legislation in 2022 that strengthened the law requiring administrations to give a detailed reasoning for the firing of an IG, said she was frustrated by Trump's move. \"I don't understand why one would fire individuals whose mission is to root out waste, fraud and abuse,\" Collins said. \"So this leaves a gap in what I know is a priority for President Trump, so I don't understand it.\" Some Republican senators who have been staunch supporters of Trump, however, praised the firings. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said he's \"all for it\" when asked about Trump's move to dismiss the inspectors general. \"We need to clean house. I mean, if they're not for this country to move on down the road,\" he said. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., however, said the firing of the IG's was \"one more example of the lack of respect for the rule of law.\" \"He seems to be trying to throw a monkey wrench into the kind of any independence left in our government,\" Warner said of Trump. \"The whole idea of inspector generals is to have that independent check. Who is going to take those jobs going forward?\" Later Saturday, the ranking Democrats on the House committees sent a letter to Trump strongly condemning the firing of several inspectors general. \"Your actions violate the law, attack our democracy, and undermine the safety of the American people,\" the group wrote. \"Firing inspectors general without due cause is antithetical to good government, undermines the proper stewardship of taxpayer dollars, and degrades the federal government's ability to function effectively and efficiently,\" they added.

Meanwhile, two more of Trump's picks for his Cabinet -- Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense and Kristi Noem as secretary of Homeland Security -- were sworn in to office on Saturday. In a post on X thus morning, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that Belarus “just unilaterally released an innocent American, ANASTASSIA Nuhfer, who was taken under JOE BIDEN!” Rubio credited Trump and Chris Welby Smith, the State Department’s deputy assistant secretary for Eastern Europe, for the release.   Nuhfer was detained in early December 2024 and visited by a consular officer about three weeks ago, a State Department spokesperson said. -ABC News' Shannon Kingston Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, the top Trump appointee in the Justice Department, is currently in Chicago to “personally observe DHS immigration enforcement operations and support the efforts of FBI, DEA, ATF, USMS, and federal prosecutors who are assisting DHS in this critical mission,” a DOJ spokesperson told ABC News. The department declined to provide any additional details about Bove’s precise location or the planned “enforcement operations” he will be overseeing.   His presence on the ground, however, further highlights how the Trump administration plans to involve the highest level officials at DOJ as part of its broader show of force on immigration enforcement. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement said in a statement Sunday that it, \"along with federal partners, including the FBI, ATF, DEA, CBP and the U.S. Marshals Service, began conducting enhanced targeted operations today in Chicago to enforce U.S. immigration law and preserve public safety and national security by keeping potentially dangerous criminal aliens out of our communities.\" -ABC News' Alexander Mallin The Coast Guard said it's helping transport migrants who are in the country illegally and who are in locations where there aren't Defense Department assets. In a Saturday news release, the Coast Guard said it is conducting flights between Texas and California to get migrants to DOD bases to be removed from the country.   \"Border czar\" Tom Homan said the Trump administration isplanning to use military aircraftevery day to help carry out large-scale deportations. For the first time ever, the U.S. government is using military aircraft to transport migrants out of the U.S., Homan said. -ABC News' Luke Barr Kristi Noem was sworn in as secretary of Homeland Security Saturday afternoon. Noem’s oath of office was scheduled around the same time as Trump's Las Vegas rally, and therefore her ceremony was delayed. -ABC News' Kelsey Walsh"

        "content": "Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. A “For Sale” sign is displayed in front of a home in Morton Grove, Ill., Sunday, Aug. 25, 2024. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) LOS ANGELES (AP) — The latest evidence that homeownership is becoming increasingly less accessible to many Americans: Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last year to a nearly 30-year low for the second time in as many years. Elevated mortgage rates, a yearslong shortage of homes on the market andrecord-high home pricescontinued to stymie prospective home shoppers, especially first-time buyers. That led existing home sales to fall 0.7% last year to 4.06 million — the weakest showing for home sales since 1995 and edging out the terrible year for sales in 2023, the National Association of Realtors said Friday. Even in the midst of a sales slump, a dearth of homes on the market and rising mortgage rates gave sellers an edge over buyers, helping drive up the national median home price for all of last year to an all-time high $407,500, an increase of 4.7% from a year earlier. “How is it possible that home sales can be this low, considering that the U.S. population has increased by more than 70 million over this time period from 1995 to today?” asked Lawrence Yun, the NAR’s chief economist. “One can partly answer that question because of the affordability issue. Record-high home prices, mortgage rates having risen, but also lack of inventory.” The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump dating back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage surged to a 23-year high of nearly 8% in October 2023 and briefly fell to a 2-year low last September, but has beenmostly hovering around 7%,according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac.  The buying power of Americans now facing higher costs to borrow money for homes that have soared in value has been significantly stunted. With so few homes up for sale, millions of would-be homebuyers have found themselves on the sidelines. At the end of December, there were just 1.15 million homes on the market, NAR said. While that was up 16.2% from a year earlier, the inventory remained well below the annual historical average of about 1.98 million, according to data going back to 1999. The available inventory at the end of last month amounts to a 3.3-month supply, going by the current sales pace. In a more balanced market between buyers and sellers, there is a 4- to 6-month supply. “This means that the problems in the U.S. housing market continue to worsen in terms of availability of homes for sale and the upward pressure on home prices,” Eugenio Aleman, chief economist at Raymond James, wrote in a research note. Many factors have contributed to the housing shortage, including more than a decade of below-average new home construction and homeowners hanging on to their properties longer. And while President Donald Trump made increasing the housing supply one of his election campaign platforms, there are no quick fixes. “Over the past decade, the U.S. has averaged about 5.2 million home sales annually,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS. “It is going to take years before we are back at that level, maybe not even until the 2030s. The lack of inventory is the key constraint.” A sharp drop in the mortgage rate boosted the purchasing power of Americans in 2020 and 2021. While many economists predict that the average rate on a 30-year mortgage will ease this year, they generally don’t expect it to fall below 6%, about twice what it was five years ago. When mortgage rates ease, they can encourage home shoppers. A pullback in rates last fall helped home sales increase on a monthly basis in the last three months of the year. Home sales in December rose 2.2% from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis to a 4.24 million annual pace, NAR said. That topped the 4.2 million pace forecast by analysts polled by FactSet. Sales rose 9.3% in December versus the same month last year. The median home sales price rose for the 18th consecutive month in December to $404,000, up 6% from a year earlier. Limited inventory, especially in the more affordable price range of a given market, helps drive prices higher. That’s one reason many first-time homebuyers, who don’t have any home equity to put toward their down payment, continue to struggle. They accounted for 31% of all homes sold last month, up from 30% in November and 29% in December 2023. However, the annual share of first-time buyers was 24%. It’s been 40% historically.

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)                 PARK CITY, Utah (AP) —Rose Byrneplays a mother in the midst of a breakdown in the experiential psychological thriller “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You.” Anticipation was high for the A24 film, which will be released sometime this year. Its premiere Friday at theSundance Film Festivalwas easily the hottest ticket in town, with even ticketholders unable to get in. Those who did make it into the Library theater were treated to an intense, visceral, inventive story from filmmaker Mary Bronstein that has quickly become one of the festival’s must-sees. Byrne plays Linda, who is barely hanging on while managing her daughter’s mysterious illness. She’s faced with crisis after crisis, big and small — from the massive, gaping hole in their apartment ceiling that forces them to move to a dingy motel, to an escalating showdown with a parking attendant at a care center. The cracks in her psychological, emotional and physical wellbeing are become too much to bear. “I’d never seen a movie before where a mother is going through a crisis with a child but our energy is not with the child’s struggle, it’s with the mother’s,” Bronstein said at the premiere. “If you’re a caretaker, you shouldn’t be bothering with yourself at all. It should all be about the person you’re taking care of, right? And that is a particular kind of emotional burnout state that I was really interested in exploring.” Byrne and Bronstein went deep in the preparation phase, having long discussions about Linda with the goal of making her as real as possible before the quick, 27-day shoot. Byrne said she was obsessed with figuring out who Linda was before the crisis. The film was in part inspired by Bronstein’s experience with her own daughter, but she didn’t want to elaborate on the specifics.  “That’s her story to tell,” Bronstein said. Part of Linda’s story involves her therapist, played byConan O’Brien, who joked that he didn’t realize he was in a movie. “I’m not looking out for movie scripts or anything. But when I got a call from A24 that they wanted me to read something, I’m not stupid,” O’Brien said. “I showed it to my wife, who is one of the smartest people I know, and she read through it and she said, ‘I didn’t know they made movies like this anymore.’” He was particularly in awe of his director and co-star, saying he felt like a fraud standing beside them. “It was an amazing experience, one of the best experiences of my life, just to be with them and watch them work,” O’Brien said. “I don’t know how (Byrne) did that and not check into a hospital afterwards, because I haven’t seen any actor, man or woman, sustain that level for an entire movie.” “I feel like I have to go to a hospital now, because this was the first time I watched it,” he added. “I’m a mess.” A$AP Rockyalso co-stars, as a man Linda meets at the motel, but was not in Park City for the premiere. He is currentlyon trial, charged with firing a gun at a former friend. The film is full of ambiguity, metaphor and just plain artistic expression that Bronstein hesitated to explain, from the name itself to the hole in the ceiling, which takes on a somewhat supernatural quality. “When we have nothing left to give, we have an emptiness inside of us,” Bronstein said. “And that emptiness is actually not empty: It’s filled with all the darkness and self-hate and doubt and fear and dread and regret and everything. … That to me is what the hole is.” Some of it, she said, she doesn’t even fully understand. The point is the experience, and critics and Sundance audiences are already fully on board. Bronstein, a bit of a cult figure in the film world, made her directorial debut in 2008 at the SXSW festival with “Yeast,” which featured a pre-fame Greta Gerwig and was hailed by by New Yorker critic Richard Brody as a “mumblecore classic.” “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” is only her second feature. “This is the first time that anybody else has paid for me to make art,” Bronstein said. “I’m proud to say that this is the film that came directly from my head to the screen.” For more coverage of the 2025 Sundance Film Festival, visit:https://apnews.com/hub/sundance-film-festival   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi)       Ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon appeared at risk on Sunday as disputes continued over key deadlines, and local health officials said that Israeli forces opened fire on both fronts. In Gaza,Israel accused Hamasof violating the ceasefire there by changing the order of hostages it has released. Citing that, Israel has stopped thousands of Palestinians from returning to the northern part ofthe Gaza Stripas expected by Sunday. Local health officials said that Israeli forces fired on the crowd, killing two. Israel said civilian hostage Arbel Yehoud should have been releasedbefore the four soldiers freed on Saturday. Mediators the United States, Qatar and Egypt were working on the issue. In Lebanon, health officials said thatIsraeli forces opened fireon protesters in the south who demanded that Israel withdraw in line with the ceasefire agreement, killing at least 22. Separately, officials with Hamas and Jordan rejected U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion that most of Gaza’s populationshould be at least temporarily resettled elsewhere, including in Egypt and Jordan. The war in Gaza broke out after Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people in southern Israel in an attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and abducted around 250. Israel’s retaliatory military operation has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of thevictims childrenand women, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians. Here is the latest: RAMALLAH, West Bank — The office of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has sharply condemned U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion to “clean out” the Gaza Strip and request that Egypt and Jordan take in more Palestinians. In a statement, the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited control over parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, says the prospect of mass displacement from the Gaza Strip “constitutes a violation of the red lines that we have repeatedly warned against.” “Our people will not leave,” the statement said. “We warn of the repercussions of such a dangerous Israeli policy that contributes to severing the ties of the Gaza Strip, and displacing its people, which will lead to destabilization and security.” Trump’s remarks suggesting that Palestinians be encouraged to leave Gaza gets at the core of Palestinian fears that they will be driven from their remaining homeland. The Palestinian presidency said it was “ready to assume its full duties in the Gaza Strip” in hopes of eventually establishing an independent Palestinian state. The Palestinian Authority, based in the West Bank city of Ramallah, briefly controlled Gaza after Israeli troops withdrew in 2005, only to be driven out by its rival Hamas two years later. PARIS — France will consider allowing Israeli companies to participate in the Paris Air Show in June, thanks to ceasefire agreements in Gaza and Lebanon, the French president’s office said Sunday. That was among the results of a conversation Sunday between French President Emmanuel Macron and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Macron said France hopes to help speed up the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza, two of whom are French citizens. Macron also urged Israel to allow for a ″massive″ facilitation of aid to Gaza’s population, and to fulfill its promises to withdraw troops from Lebanon under a truce brokered by the U.S. and France. Netanyahu asked about Israeli participation in the upcoming Paris Air Show at Le Bourget, a major industry event. The French president said Israeli participation ″could be favorably considered, as a consequence of the cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon,″ according to Macron’s office. Tensions surrounded Israel’s participation in twoarms shows in Francelast year, Eurosatory and Euronaval. The French government did not want Israel displaying any weapons used in its wars in Gaza and Lebanon. RAMALLAH, West Bank — A spokesman for the Islamic Jihad, Gaza’s second-largest militant group, says the dispute over an Israeli hostage that has kept Palestinians from returning home to northern Gaza has been settled. Mohamed al-Hajj Mousa added in a statement that the group told mediators that the hostage, Arbel Yehoud, will be released before Saturday, when the next exchange of hostages from Gaza for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody is set to take place. There is no immediate comment from Israel, which has accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire by changing the order of hostages it has released. It expected Yehoud to be freed this weekend, and it has put the movement of Palestinians into northern Gaza on hold. RAMALLAH, West Bank — The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees says that if Israel carries out its threat to close its east Jerusalem headquarters on Thursday, the outsize effects will be felt acutely and immediately by tens of thousands of Palestinians. The agency, known as UNRWA, runs 12 facilities that provide critical public services across east Jerusalem, including schools enrolling at least 1,200 children and free clinics serving over 70,000 people. “That’s the thing, it has an impact on people’s lives,” Juliette Touma, a spokeswoman for UNRWA, said of the potential closure. In the Shuafat refugee camp, an impoverished neighborhood, “people today can walk just a few meters and they’re in an excellent clinic,” Touma said. But if it’s shuttered, she said, tens of thousands of Palestinians would have to cross a difficult checkpoint, pay for transport and, even if they’re eligible for Israeli primary health care, also pay for medicine in order to see a doctor or get a blood test. “We’re talking about the poorest of the poor,” Touma said. “Right now, they have no alternative.” The closure of UNRWA schools would raise all sorts of problems given that there are already too few classrooms in the overcrowded Palestinian areas of east Jerusalem, she said. Touma said much remains unclear about the Israeli order, including whether the closure would apply to operations in east Jerusalem only or to the entirety of the Palestinian territories. Israel says the agency has allowed itself to be infiltrated by Hamas, allegations denied by the U.N. TEL AVIV, Israel — Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and former National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, both want Israel to establish Jewish settlements in Gaza, supported Trump’s remarks, calling it “voluntary emigration.” Palestinians and many of their supporters view it as code for ethnic cleansing. In a post on X Sunday, Smotrich called the idea of “helping (Palestinians) find other places to start new, good lives” great and said he would work with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to that end. Ben-Gvir, who quit Netanyahu’s government over the current ceasefire in Gaza, said Trump’s remarks gave Israel the green light to move ahead on “voluntary emigration.” “When the president of the world’s largest superpower brings it up himself, the government of Israel should implement it,” he said in a statement. Netanyahu has said building Jewish settlements in Gaza is not realistic. Israel withdrew troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but maintains a blockade with Egypt on the territory. JERUSALEM — The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees says its staff was directed to vacate the premises by Thursday. Israelpassed legislation last yearcutting all ties with the agency and barring it from operating in its territory. It says the agency, which is the main provider of aid in the Gaza Strip, has allowed itself to be infiltrated by Hamas, allegations denied by the U.N. In a statement Sunday, the agency, known as UNRWA, said the order to vacate “is in contradiction to international law obligations of U.N. member states,” including Israel. “United Nations premises are inviolable and enjoy privileges and immunities under the United Nations Charter.” UNRWA closed its east Jerusalem headquarters last May after Israeli protesters set fire to its perimeter. DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Bassem Naim said that “even if seemingly well-intentioned under the guise of reconstruction,” the Palestinian people will never agree to such a proposal. He also said the Palestinians can rebuild Gaza “even better than before”if Israel lifts its blockade. DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli forces fired on the crowds on three occasions overnight and into Sunday. Those killed included a child, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel has pulled back from several areas of Gaza as part of the ceasefire, which came into force last Sunday, but the military has warned people to stay away from its forces, which are still operating in a buffer zone inside Gaza along the border and in the Netzarim corridor.

The zero break points Sinner faced. Or the 10 he accumulated. The 27-13 advantage in points that lasted at least nine strokes. Or the way Sinner accumulated more winners, 32 to 25, and fewer unforced errors, 27 to 45. The way Sinner won 10 of the 13 points that ended with him at the net. Or the way he only let Zverev go 14 of 27 in that category, frequently zipping passing shots out of reach.  Well, here’s is one more bit of evidence: what Zverev said about Sinner.  “I’m serving better than him, but that’s it. He does everything else better than me. He moves better than me. He hits his forehand better than me. He hits his backhand better than me. He returns better than me. He volleys better than me,” Zverev said. “At the end of the day, tennis has five or six massive shots — like, massive factors — and he does four or five of them better than me. That’s the reason why he won.”  High praise from a guy who is, after all, ranked No. 2. Sinner has held the No. 1 spot since last June andis not showing any signs of relinquishing it. This was the first Australian Open final between the men at No. 1 and No. 2 since 2019, whenNo. 1 Novak Djokovic defeated No. 2 Rafael Nadal— also in straight sets.  “It’s amazing,” Sinner said, “to achieve these things.”   The “things” include being the youngest man to leave Melbourne Park with the trophy two years in a row since Jim Courier in 1992-93, and the first man sinceNadalat the French Open in 2005 and 2006 to follow up his firstGrand Slamtitle by repeating as the champion at the same tournament a year later.

(AP Photo/Manish Swarup)   Sinner was asked later whether he felt more relief or excitement when he raised his arms after the last point was his.  “This one was joy. We managed to do something incredible this time, because the situation I was in was completely different from a year ago here,” he said. “I had more pressure.”  Probably true, but’s hard to tell.  Go to the start of 2024, and take stock. In that span, Sinner has won three of the five major tournaments, including the U.S. Open in September, meaning he now has claimed three straight hard-court Slams. His record is 80-6 with nine titles. His current unbeaten run covers 21 matches.  “There’s always something that can get better,” said one of his two coaches, Simone Vagnozzi. “He is playing really well right now and everything comes easily. But there will be tough moments ahead.”  The only thing that’s clouded the past 12 months for Sinner, it seems,is the doping casein which his exoneration was appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency. He tested positive for a trace amount of an anabolic steroid twice last March but blamed it on an accidental exposure involving two members of his team who have since been fired. Sinner initially was cleared in August; ahearing in the WADA appealis scheduled for April.  “I keep playing like this because I have a clear mind on what happened,” Sinner said Sunday. “I know if I would be guilty, I would not play like this.”  While he became the eighth man in the Open era (which began in 1968) to start his career 3-0 in Grand Slam finals,Zverev is the seventh to be 0-3, adding this loss to those at the 2020 U.S. Open and last year’s French Open.  Those earlier setbacks both came in five sets. This contest was not that close. Not at all.  “I’ll keep doing everything I can,” Zverev said, “to lift one of those trophies.”  Just beforeZverev began speakinginto a microphone during the trophy ceremony, a voice cried out from the stands, making reference to two of the player’s ex-girlfriends whoaccused him of physical abuse.  During the match, there truly was only one moment that contained a hint of tension. It came when Zverev was two points from owning the second set at 5-4, love-30. But a break point — and a set point — never arrived.  A year ago, Sinner went through a lot more trouble to earn his first major, needing to get past Novak Djokovic —who quit one set into his semifinalagainst Zverev on Friday because of a torn hamstring — beforeerasing a two-set deficit in the finalagainst 2021 U.S. Open champion Daniil Medvedev.  This time, Sinner applied pressure with an all-around style that does not really appear to have holes.  He proved superior in every meaningful way other than aces, leaving Zverev shaking his head or trudging to the sideline with shoulders sagging or cracking his racket against the court or against another racket.  Perfectly understandable, given what Sinner can do to an opponent, especially on a hard court.  “The facts speak for themselves,” Zverev said. “He’s in a different universe right now.”   Howard Fendrich has been the AP’s tennis writer since 2002.

NASA’s four Magnetospheric Multiscale, or MMS, satellites at the Astrotech Space Operations facility in Titusville, Florida, March 2015. (NASA via AP) NEW YORK (AP) — Scientists have detected cosmic waves thatsound like birds chirpingin an unexpected place. These bursts of plasma, called chorus waves, ripple at the same frequency ashuman hearing. When converted to audio signals, their sharp notes mimichigh-pitched bird calls. Researchers have captured such sounds in space before, but now they have sensed the chirping waves from much farther away: over 62,000 miles (100,000 kilometers) from Earth, where they’ve never been measured before. “That opens up a lot of new questions about the physics that could be possible in this area,” said Allison Jaynes, a space physicist at the University of Iowa who was not involved with the work. AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on scientists sensing a chirping chorus in an unexpected place. Scientists still aren’t sure how the perturbations happen, but they thinkEarth’s magnetic fieldmay have something to do with it. The chorus has been picked up on radio antennas for decades, including receivers at an Antarctica research station in the 1960s. And twin spacecraft — NASA’s Van Allen Probes — heard the chirps from Earth’s radiation belts at a closer distance than the newest detection. The latest notes were picked up by NASA’s Magnetospheric Multiscale satellites, launched in 2015 to explore the Earth and sun’s magnetic fields. The new researchwas published Wednesdayin the journal Nature. Chorus waves have also been spotted near other planets including Jupiter and Saturn. They can even produce high-energy electrons capable of scrambling satellite communications.   “They are one of the strongest and most significant waves in space,” said study author Chengming Liu from Beihang University in an email. The newfound chorus waves were detected in a region where Earth’s magnetic field is stretched out, which scientists didn’t expect. That raises fresh questions about how these chirping waves form. “It’s very captivating, very compelling,” Jaynes said. “We definitely need to find more of these events.” The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "Palestinians face challenges of rebuilding lives torn apart by Gaza war. Gaza has become a wasteland of ruins and rubble due to Israel's conflict with Hamas following the terror organization's surprise attack on Oct. 7, 2023. However, now that a ceasefire is in place, families are returning to their neighborhoods, hoping to rebuild the places they once called home. One of the families excited to be back is the Ghaly family. After leaving the tents they had lived in for months, they are taking the few possessions they still have. As they returned to see the rubble, evidence of the destructive force where no building was left untouched, they also saw their family home. \"This is our four-story home,\" Eyad Abu Ghaly said. \"It has been completely flattened, and there was no reason for that. We don’t understand why the house was bombed.\" Eyad further explains, “The resistance does not exist here — just civilians.” Many homes that are still standing are wrecked inside, and as people wonder how they will ever rebuild, there’s also fear that war will soon return. \"I look at young people and wonder, 'Where will they go?'\" Ghaly said. \"There’s no future for them — no education, no health care. There is no life, no life at all.\" The agreement between Hamas and Israel, which ended the fighting and resulted in three Israeli hostages being freed on Sunday and reuniting with their families, was initially based on a six-week ceasefire. On Inauguration Day, President Donald Trump stated he was not confident that a second phase of the deal could be reached to prolong the truce and free all remaining hostages, both living and deceased. Tal Haimi was killed in the Oct. 7 massacre, but his body was taken into Gaza by Hamas. His cousin, Udi Goren, said that if Israel prioritizes the release of all hostages, it will further weaken Hamas. \"It is in our interest,\" Goren said. \"Bring back the hostages because that's more valuable to Hamas than anything else. And once we have the hostages back home, then we need to keep doing what we're actually doing right now, collaborating with the mediators in creating a different future for Gaza, where Hamas is not a part of it.\" But as soon as the ceasefire kicked in in Gaza, Hamas gunmen were parading through the streets. Then, the hostage handover was used to show they were back in charge. With no sign that Hamas is willing to capitulate, a former Israeli general close to the Israeli government states that it is unlikely the six-week ceasefire will be prolonged. Retired Israel Defense Forces Brigadier General Amir Avivi told ABC News that Israel is discussing a second deal. Yet this deal involves not just the release of hostages, but also requires Hamas to surrender, relinquish its control over Gaza, and vacate the area. \"And we will have to pressure and continue degrading Hamas capabilities to an extent where they will understand that it's game over,\" Avivi said. While teams in Gaza search the rubble for more bodies, there is no clear sense of who or what could govern Gaza if Hamas were to be removed. According to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, the war has already claimed 47,000 lives. Some 1,200 were killed in southern Israel during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, according to Israeli officials. In examining Gaza before the war and observing the devastation now, aid agencies warn that thousands more dead have not yet been counted or found. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(AP Photo/Ben Curtis)           WASHINGTON (AP) —President Donald Trump’sfirst week in office isn’t over yet, but already itoffers signalsabout how his next four years in the White House may unfold. Some takeaways from the earliest days of his second term: Within hours of being sworn in, Trumppardoned more than 1,500people who were convicted or charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by his supporters. Those pardonedinclude people who attacked, bloodied and beat police officers that day. The Republican president’s decision was at odds with earlier comments by his incoming vice president, JD Vance, and other senior aides that Trump would only let off those who weren’t violent. The pardons were the first of many moves he made in his first week to reward allies and punish critics, in both significant and subtle ways. It signaled that without the need to worry about reelection — the Constitution bars a third term — or legal consequences after the Supreme Court granted presidents expansive immunity, the new president, backed by a Republican Congress, has little to restrain him. Trump ended protective security details forDr. Anthony Fauci, his former COVID-19 adviser, along with former national security adviser John Bolton, formerSecretary of State Mike Pompeoand his onetime deputy. The security protections had been regularly extended by the Biden administration over credible threats to the men’s lives. Trump alsorevokedthe security clearances of dozens of former government officials who had criticized him, including Bolton, and directed that the portrait of a former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, retired Gen. Mark Milley be removed from the Pentagon walls.  In his first days in office, Trump demonstrated just how much he and his team had learned from four often-chaotic years in the White House and four more in political exile. A president’s most valuable resource is time and Trump set out in his first hours to make his mark on the nation with executive orders, policy memoranda and government staffing shake-ups. It reflected a level of sophistication that eluded him in his first term and surpassed his Democratic predecessors in its scale and scope for their opening days in the Oval Office. Feeling burned by the holdover of Obama administration appointees during his first go-around, Trumpswiftly exiledBiden holdovers and moved to test new hires for their fealty to his agenda. In a matter of days heuprooted four yearsof diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the federal government, sent federal troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and erased Biden’s guardrails on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency development. In his first term, Trump’s early executive orders were more showpieces than substance and frequently were blocked by federal courts. This time, Trump is still confronting the limits of his constitutional authorities, but is also far more adept at controlling what is within them. An hour after concluding a relatively sedate inaugural address in the Capitol Rotunda, Trump decided to let loose. Speaking to an overflow crowd of governors, political supports and dignitaries in the Capitol Visitor Center’s Emancipation Hall, Trump ripped in to Biden, the Justice Department and other perceived rivals. He followed it up with an even longer speech to supporters at a downtown arena and in more than 50 minutes of remarks and questions and answers with reporters in the Oval Office. For all of Trump’s experience and organization, he is still very much the same Donald Trump, and just as intent as before on dominating the center of the national conversation. If not more. He has acted to try to end civil service protections for many federal workers andoverturn more than a century of lawon birthright citizenship. Such moves have been a magnet for legal challenges. In the case of the birthright citizenship order, it met swift criticism from U.S. District Judge John Coughenour, who put a temporary stay on Trump’s plans. “I’ve been on the bench for over four decades. I can’t remember another case where the question presented was as clear as this one is,” Coughenour, who was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan, told a Justice Department attorney. “This is a blatantly unconstitutional order.” How those court cases play out will determine not only the fate of some of Trump’s most controversial actions, but just how far any president can go in pushing an agenda. The president likes to call it “liquid gold.” His main economic assumption is that more oil production by the United States, the Saudis and the rest of OPEC would bring down prices. That would reduce overall inflation and cut down on the oil revenues that Russia is using to fund its war in Ukraine. For Trump, oil is the answer. He’s betting that fossil fuels are the future, despite the climate change risks. “The United States has the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth, and we’re going to use it,” Trump said in a Thursday speech. “Not only will this reduce the cost of virtually all goods and services, it’ll make the United States a manufacturing superpower and the world capital of artificial intelligence and crypto” Trump had theworld’s wealthiest menbehind him on the dais when he took the oath of office on Monday. Tesla’s Elon Musk, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and LVMH’s Bernard Arnault were all there. SoftBank billionaire Masayoshi Son was in the audience. Later in the week, Oracle’s Larry Ellison and OpenAI’s Sam Altman appeared with Son at the White House to announce an artificial intelligence investment of up to $500 billion. Musk, the Trump backer who is leading the president’s Department of Government Efficiency effort, posted on X that SoftBank didn’t have the money. Altman, a rival to to Musk on AI, responded over X that the funding was there. By surrounding himself with the wealthiest people in tech, Trump is also stuck in their drama. “The people in the deal are very, very smart people,” Trump said Thursday. “But Elon, one of the people, he happens to hate. But I have certain hatreds of people, too.” America’s 25th president has a big fan in Trump. Trump likes the tariffs that were imposed during Republican William McKinley’s presidency and helped to fund the government. Trump has claimed the country was its wealthiest in the 1890s when McKinley was in office. But McKinley might not be a great economic role model for the 21st century. For starters, the Tax Foundation found that federal receipts were equal to just 3% of the overall economy in 1900, McKinley’s reelection year. Tax revenues are now equal to about 17% of the U.S. economy and that’s still not enough to fund the government without running massive deficits. So it would be hard to go full McKinley without some chaos. As Dartmouth College economist Douglas Irwin noted on X, the economic era defined by McKinley was not that great for many people. “There was a little something called the Panic of 1893 and the unemployment rate was in double digits from 1894-98!!” Irwin wrote. “Not a great decade!”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Rain was falling across Southern California on Sunday, bringing some relief to thousands of firefighters battling multiplemajor blazesfor nearly a month in the Los Angeles area, but also prompting new threats of floods and mudslides across burn-scarred lands. A flood watch issued by the National Weather Service is to go into effect at 10 a.m. local time on Sunday for fire-ravaged areas of Los Angeles County, which has been ground zero for the historic firestorms that have leveled thousands of homes and killed at least 28 people since first igniting on Jan. 7. The flood watch will remain in effect until Monday afternoon in burn-scarred areas left by the Eaton, Palisades, Franklin, Bridge and Hughes fires. The rain is forecast to be widespread but is expected to be light enough to avoid major flooding. But if a downpour spends enough time over one of the recent burn scars, a debris flow could become an issue. Rain totals from the storm will mostly range from a half-inch to an inch, allowing for a decent soaking for the first time in months. Since June 1, Los Angeles has only picked up 0.03 inches of rainfall, which has allowed an extreme drought to develop across the area for the first time in two years. In addition to rain, higher elevations of Southern California, including the San Gabriel Mountains straddling northern Los Angeles and western San Bernardino counties, are expecting snow, with areas above 4,000 feet getting up to 14 inches of powder. The rain and snow forecast comes as firefighters continued to battle five active fires on Sunday from Ventura County north of Los Angeles to the Mexican border south of San Diego. The Palisades Fire, which ignited on Jan. 7 in Los Angeles County's Pacific Palisades, was 84% contained as of Sunday after burning more than 23,000 acres, destroying nearly 7,000 structures and killing 11 people, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). The Eaton Fire, which also broke out on Jan. 7 in Pasadena and Altadena, was 95% contained on Sunday after burning more than 14,000 acres, destroying more than 9,400 structures and killing 17 people. Other fires still active on Sunday, according to Cal Fire, include the Hughes Fire near Castaic Lake, about 45 miles north of downtown Los Angeles, which was 90% contained after starting on Wednesday and burning more than 10,000 acres of brush land; the Border 2 Fire that broke out Thursday near the San Diego-Mexico border and is 10% contained after burning more than 6,600 acres of wilderness land; and the Laguna Fire, which also started Thursday in Camarillo in Ventura County, which was 98% contained on Sunday after charring 83 acres and prompting a brief evacuation of the California State University Channel Islands. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "content": "The FBI said a 21-year-old woman was arrested for fatally shooting the agent. An arrest has been made in thefatal shooting of a U.S. Border Patrol agentduring a traffic stop in Vermont, according to the FBI, as bizarre details of the suspects' movements beforehand have been revealed in the arrest affidavit. Teresa Youngblut, 21, of Washington state, was arrested on Friday and charged with assault on a federal law enforcement officer, according to a statement from the FBI. The affidavit unsealed by investigators reveals some new details about the movements of the two individuals who were involved in the fatal shooting of Border Patrol agent David Maland. Since Jan. 14, investigators had been conducting \"periodic surveillance\" on Youngblut and Felix Baukholt, a German national who was killed during the shooting, after they were reported as suspicious by someone who was staying at the same hotel as the pair, according to court records. \"An employee of a hotel in Lyndonville, Vermont contacted law enforcement after a male and a female had checked into the hotel to report concerns about them, including that they appeared to be dressed in all-black tactical style clothing with protective equipment, with the woman, later identified as Youngblut, carrying an apparent firearm in an exposed-carry holster,\" according to charges unsealed in Vermont federal court on Friday. Agents from the Vermont State Police and Homeland Security Investigations attempted to approach the pair for a voluntary interview, but they rebuffed law enforcement, \"claiming that they were in the vicinity to look at purchasing property,\" according to the court records. Five days later, the pair were spotted in downtown Newport, Vermont, in \"similar tactical dress\" and carrying a handgun, which is permitted in Vermont, the affidavit said. On Monday, the day of the fatal shooting, the two were being observed by law enforcement in the parking lot of a Walmart nearby, prosecutors said. Investigators observed Baukholt come out of the store with rolls of aluminum foil that he then used to wrap cellphones, they said. The stop was initiated by Border Patrol agents under the pretext of an immigration violation, according to the court records. Between 3 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. agents reported gunshots from the scene, according to the affidavit. Agents described to their supervisor \"that both Baukholt and Youngblut possessed firearms and that Youngblut drew and fired a handgun toward at least one of the uniformed Border Patrol agents without warning when outside the driver's side of the Prius. Baukholt then attempted to draw a firearm. At least one Border Patrol agent fired at Youngblut and Baukholt with his service weapon,\" according to the affidavit. Upon searching the vehicle, agents found a cache of weapons and tactical gear, as well as the cellphones wrapped in foil. The agents have not been interviewed according to the complaint, officials said. \"Agent Maland bravely served his country as a member of the U.S. Air Force,\" said Special Agent in Charge Craig Tremaroli of the FBI Albany Field Office in a statement. \"He continued that service when he answered the call to protect and serve as a law enforcement officer, making him a shining example of service over self. This arrest proves the FBI, together with our partners, will work diligently to ensure any individual who uses a firearm to assault such a public servant will be brought to justice.\" ABC News' Alex Faul contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "Prosecutors say they won’t charge rocker Marilyn Manson after a years-long investigation into sexual assault and domestic violence allegations LOS ANGELES --Prosecutors said Friday that they will not file charges againstMarilyn Mansonafter a years-long investigation of allegations of sexual assault and domestic violence. Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said the allegations are too old under the law and the evidence is not sufficient to charge the 56-year-old shock rocker whose legal name is Brian Warner. “We have determined that allegations of domestic violence fall outside of the statute of limitations, and we cannot prove charges of sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt,” Hochman said. “We recognize and applaud the courage and resilience of the women who came forward to make reports and share their experiences, and we thank them for their cooperation and patience with the investigation.” Nearly four years after the investigation began, then-District Attorney George Gascón said on Oct. 9 that his office was pursuing new leads that added to the “already extensive” file that authorities had amassed. LA County sheriff’s detectives said early in 2021 that they were investigating Manson for incidents between 2009 and 2011 in West Hollywood, where Manson lived at the time. The probe included a search warrant that was served on his West Hollywood home. The case was initially turned over to prosecutors in September 2021, but the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office requested more evidence-gathering andthe investigation resumed. “We are very pleased that, after a thorough and incredibly lengthy review of all of the actual evidence, the District Attorney has concluded what we knew and expressed from the start — Brian Warner is innocent,” his attorney, Howard King, said in a statement. The identities of the women police and prosecutors spoke to were not revealed, but “Game of Thrones” actor Esmé Bianco — who sued Manson in a case that has been settled — said she was part of the criminal investigation. Before the decision not to prosecute, she criticized how long the process was taking at a rally for Hochman, who was elected soon after. “Almost four years ago, I did what victims of rape are supposed to do: I went to the police,” she said on Oct. 10. “I described to them in agonizing detail how the rock musician Brian Warner — better known by his stage name Marilyn Manson — had raped and abused me over the course of our relationship.” Bianco said she gave investigators “hundreds of pieces of evidence, including photos of my body covered in bites, bruises and knife wounds, emails and text messages, threats to my immigration status.” In her lawsuit, Bianco alleged sexual, physical and emotional abuse, and said that Manson violated human trafficking law by bringing her to California from England for non-existent roles in music videos and movies. “Whilst I am deeply disappointed by the decision of the District Attorney to not bring charges in the case against Brian Warner, I am sadly not surprised,” Bianco said in a statement released by her lawyer. “Once again, our justice system has failed survivors. Not the individual prosecutors and detectives who worked for years on this case, but the system that made them do so with one hand tied behind their collective backs.” In 2021 Manson's former fiancée, “Westworld” actor Evan Rachel Wood, named him as her abuser for the first time in an Instagram post. Wood and Manson’s relationship became public in 2007 when he was 38 and she was 19, and they were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up. “He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years,” Wood said. Manson replied on Instagram that these were “horrible distortions of reality.” He sued Wood, saying she and another woman fabricated accusations against him and convinced others to do the same. A judge threw out significant sections of the suit, then in November, Manson agreed to drop it and pay Wood's attorney fees. The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they’ve been sexually abused, unless they come forward publicly as Bianco and Wood have done. Other women sued Manson in the months after Wood came forward. Wood's representative did not immedately return a message Friday. Manson emerged as a musical star in the mid-1990s, known as much for courting public controversy as for hit songs like “The Beautiful People” and hit album’s like 1996’s “Antichrist Superstar” and 1998’s “Mechanical Animals.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)                              FRESNO, Texas (AP) — The only moment TiAnna Yeldell has to herself is when she’s sleeping, and that doesn’t happen much. The 44-year-old single mom of three works 80-hour weeks to provide for her children, ages 8, 14, and 18. During the day, she is a driver for Pizza Hut, where she earns $9.50 an hour before tips. At night, she cleans trains for Houston’s Metro system, where she earns about $17 an hour. The times that she pulls both shifts, Yeldell sleeps for just two to three hours before getting her kids up and ready for school. Then she does it all over again. Yeldell is among the millions of fast food workers across the U.S. scraping to get by. Abouttwo-thirdsof them are women, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and many are supporting their families on minimum wages set at the federal government’s floor of $7.25 an hour. Fast food workers are disproportionately Hispanic, making up 24.6% of the industry’s workforce compared with 18.8% of the overall workforce. And more than half of all U.S. fast food workers are 20 or older, “contrary to the myth of it being a teenage job that they just do for pocket money,” said Tsedeye Gebreselassie, an attorney for nonprofit advocacy organization National Employment Law Project.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)  President Donald Trump, whomanned the fry station at a McDonald’sin Pennsylvania while on the campaign trail last year, has acknowledged that the federal minimum wage is “very low” and that he would consider raising it, but that doing so would be “complicated.” Meanwhile, a growing number of states have pushed to increase their minimum wage in the face of record-high inflation in recent years. Voters in Alaska approved a ballot initiative in November that will raise the state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour from $11.73 an hour by 2027. Missouri voters likewise approved a minimum wage hike to $15 from $12.30 an hour by 2026. And California — which has one of the highest costs of living in the country — in Aprilraised wagesfor fast food workers specifically, to $20 an hour from $16 an hour.  By the end of this year, 23 states and 65 cities and counties will raise their minimum wage floors, according to a December 2024 National Employment Law Projectreportthat combed through legislation across the country.  But not Texas, where Yeldell and her family live. It isone of 20 statesat the $7.25 federal minimum wage floor and that rate hasn’t budged since 2009. Democratic lawmakers in Texas have repeatedly proposed legislation to raise the minimum wage in the state to no avail.Preemption laws, which exist in Texas and many other states, block cities and counties from adopting their own minimum wage laws, presenting another barrier. Today, a living wage for one adult raising three children in the Houston metro area is $57.65 an hour, according to MIT’s Living Wage Calculator. For Yeldell, it’s not possible to get by on her fast food job alone, which is why she must work a second job. Still wearing her visor and gray “No One Out Pizzas The Hut” shirt, she slumps sideways after a recent work shift, resting an elbow on the folding table surrounded by four folding chairs where the family eats. The living room furniture is sparse but the home is tidy. A yellow mop bucket sits near the entryway, and a small vacuum rests against the closet door. She only takes a moment to rest before changing into Looney Tunes sweatpants and a yellow T-shirt, scooping fajitas onto plates for the kids’ dinner, and packing up the leftovers. Then the teens disappear into their bedrooms, and her Minecraft pajama-clad youngest curls up next to her on the couch, playing a game on a bright red console. TiAnna Yeldell, left, spends time with her son Ivan, 8, right, at her home, Thursday, Nov. 14, 2024, in Missouri City, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)  “I don’t want to work two jobs -- I’m really tired. But I have to, because the jobs don’t pay enough,” Yeldell said. “I would not be able to provide a roof over my kids’ head … They come first, I come second.” The Associated Press reached out to Pizza Hut, as well as its parent company, Yum Brands, for comment on wages for fast food workers but did not hear back. Wages are just one of many issues fast food workers face. Unpredictable hours, limited access to paid sick leave, and challenging customer interactions all shape their experiences, said Daniel Schneider, co-director and co-founder of the Shift Project, a joint Harvard and University of California, San Francisco project researching the conditions of service sector work. Wage theft and other law violations are also common in the industry, added labor scholar David Madland, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. “The fast food industry is notorious for low pay and poor working conditions,” Madland said. “It’s seen as the almost the sort of typical throwaway job that policy has cared very little about.” Yeldell’s Pizza Hut deliveries sometimes go until 11 p.m. She carries a knife in her pocket, as well as a flashlight, to keep her safe.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)  TiAnna Yeldell works in the kitchen at Pizza Hut, Thursday, Nov. 14, 2024, in Missouri City, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)  Despite the challenges, Yeldell maintains a positive outlook about her job, which she started about a year and a half ago as a delivery driver and has since learned to do “pretty much everything” at her Fresno, Texas store, including making pizzas, prepping ingredients, and running the register. “Pizza Hut is a really easy job and the job is only hard if you make it hard,” she said. “And I’m a fast learner, so it doesn’t bother me. The only time that it’s worrisome is when we’re slow and they say, ‘Oh, we got to cut your hours.’” Contrast Texas to California, which now has the highest fast food minimum wage of any state since lawmakers passed a minimum $20 hourly wage for those workers. Angelica Hernandez, 51, who has worked at various McDonald’s restaurants for 20 years and now works for a Monterey Park location in Los Angeles County, said the raise helped her pay rent and bills on time, avoid late fees, and buy “a bit more” at the grocery store. It’s also allowed her family the chance to go out to eat on the weekends, “which I was never able to do before, so it’s a big accomplishment what fast food workers were able to win,” she said. But Hernandez says much of the increase was swallowed by a recent $200 rent hike. “We need a little more to be able to save money and buy clothes without being tight every two weeks or have to use credit,” she said. Now, Hernandez is a member of California Fast Food Workers Union, and councilmember on the state’s Fast Food Council established bythe new California lawand aimed at improving working conditions.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)  Critics ofthe lawsay continuing to increase minimum wage is not the answer, arguing that it has raised prices and reduced job opportunities for young people, pinching franchisees in an industry with already-slim margins. “When you see a spike in operating costs pretty dramatically in a short period of time, it creates challenges,” said Jot Condie, president and CEO of the California Restaurant Association, which opposed the law. He added that franchisees, who are essentially small business owners, are most harmed. But a September report from University of California, Berkeley’s Institute for Research on Labor and Employment called the effects of the new law “benign,” and found that the policy did not affect employment adversely and increased prices about 3.7%, or about 15 cents on a $4 hamburger. For Yeldell, increasing the minimum wage in Texas “would be more fair.” ”If other states could change, y’all can change too,” she said. Her exhaustion shines through: her movements are slow, and her eyelids droop. Between her two jobs, she has no days off so her activities with the kids have to happen on the days she works at one job, not both. But she makes it happen. On a chilly Friday morning at 7 a.m., she walks her youngest to the bus stop, then drives her daughter across town to have her senior pictures done before her Pizza Hut shift starts.

Both women’s hair is arranged in long, elegant braids with the ends curled. “Being a mother, I do what I’m supposed to do for my kids,” she said. But for all her hard work, Yeldell says the family has little to no savings. On good months, she says she has about $100 left over. Often, she has nothing, which leaves no room for vacations, or outings with kids. “At the end of the day, I’ve worked all these hours and I really have nothing to show for it, but just paying some bills,” she said.

(AP Photo/Erin Hooley, file)     CHICAGO (AP) — Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove visited Chicago on Sunday to witness the start of ramped-upimmigration enforcementin the nation’s third-largest citypromised by the Trump administration, though few details of the operation were made public. Bove said he was in Chicago on Sunday morning and observed Department of Homeland Security agents, along with assisting federal agencies — including the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives. He didn’t say where the operations took place in the city or detail any arrests. “We will support everyone at the federal, state, and local levels who joins this critical mission to take back our communities,” Bove said in a statement. “We will use all available tools to address obstruction and other unlawful impediments to our efforts to protect the homeland. Most importantly, we will not rest until the work is done.” U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Jeff Carter said the agency “began conducting enhanced targeted operations” Sunday in Chicago but declined other details, citing an ongoing operation. Spokesmen for the FBI, ATF and the Drug Enforcement Administration confirmed their involvement but didn’t give other information. Chicago residents, especially in immigrant circles,have already been on edgefor months in anticipation of large-scale arrests touted by the Trump administration. The atmosphere has been especially tense the past week as top Trump officialsvowedto start immigration enforcement operations in Chicago the day after Trump’sinaugurationbefore walking back those statements.  Immigrant rights groups havetried to preparewith campaigns for immigrants to know their rights in case of an arrest. City officials have done the same, publishing similar information at public bus and train stations. On Friday, Chicago Public Schools officialsmistakenly believedICE agents had come to a city elementary school and put out statements to that effect before learning the agents were from the Secret Service. Word of immigration agents at a school — which have long been off limits to immigration agents untilTrump ended the policylast week — drew swift criticism from community groups and Gov. JB Pritzker. The Democratic governor, a frequent Trump critic, questioned the aggressive approach of the operations and the chilling effect for others, particularly for law-abiding immigrants who have been in the country for years. “We need to get rid of the violent criminals. But we also need to protect people, at least the residents of Illinois and all across the nation, who are just doing what we hope that immigrants will do,” Pritzker said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Chicago has been one of Trump’s favorite targets. The city has some of the strongest sanctuary protections, which bar cooperation between city police and immigration agents. On Saturday, several Chicago-based immigrant rights groups filed a lawsuit against ICE, seeking an injunction prohibiting certain types of immigration raids in Chicago. “Immigrant communities who have called Chicago their home for decades are scared,” said Antonio Gutierrez from Organized Communities Against Deportation, one of the plaintiffs. “We refuse to live in fear and will fight any attempts to roll back the work we’ve done to keep families together.” Durkin Richer reported from Washington.

        "content": "Homan says administration has a “clear” message for undocumented immigrants. For the first time in U.S. history, military aircraft were used this past week to deport scores of undocumented migrants from the United States. Middle schools, Trump administration officials say, are now seen as places to target for immigration enforcement operations. And, according to President Trump's \"border czar,\" every undocumented immigrant should worry they could be arrested at any time, even if they have no criminal record. The \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, says it's all part of the Trump administration's effort to send a \"clear\" message: \"There's consequences [for] entering the country illegally,\" he told ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz on Sunday. \"If we don't show there's consequences, you're never going to fix the border problem,\" he said. More than 11 million undocumented immigrants are currently estimated to be living in the U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to take unprecedented action to remove as many of them as possible and stem the flow of more migrants coming to the southern border. In his first several days in office, Trump declared a national emergency at the border, announced an end to the so-called practice of \"catch and release\" -- when migrants claiming asylum are given court dates and then released pending those proceedings -- and sought to overturn the long-held Constitutional right of birthright citizenship, a move that immediately faced legal challenges and was at least temporarily blocked by a federal judge. As for the millions of undocumented immigrants already in the country, Homan said the administration will deport \"as many as we can,\" starting with threats to public safety threats and national security, Homan said. According to estimates released by House Republicans last year, based on government data, hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants in the country are convicted criminals or have charges pending against them. Government statistics indicate that in the past four years, hundreds of migrants were caught along the southern border with names matching known or suspected terrorists on a government watchlist. And Homan has said more than 2 million people were detected along the border but never captured, so authorities don't know who they are or what threat some of them could pose. According to statistics released by the Department of Homeland Security last year, a tiny fraction of those who reached U.S. borders in the prior three years had any kind of criminal record, and the vast majority of them involved nonviolent crimes, such as driving under the influence or previously entering the country illegally. Homan told ABC News that the Trump administration is only \"in the beginning stages\" of carrying out its mass deportation plan, making public safety threats and national security threats a \"priority,\" but \"as that aperture opens, there'll be more arrests nationwide.\" And he warned that there will be \"collateral arrests,\" especially in the so-called \"sanctuary cities\" that he says are resistant to helpingImmigrationand Customs Enforcement officials locate and arrest undocumented immigrants already in local custody for other crimes. \"Sanctuary cities lock us out of the jails,\" said Homan, who led ICE as acting director in Trump's first administration. According to Homan, that creates significant safety concerns: When an undocumented immigrant arrested for a serious crime is released by local authorities, instead of being deported, it \"endangers the community.\" Nevertheless, Homan said that's a time when ICE officers would likely make \"collateral arrests.\" \"When we find him, he's going to be with others … [and] if they're in the country illegally, they're coming too,\" he said. He emphasized that anyone in the country unlawfully is \"on the table.\" \"It's not OK to violate the laws of this country,\" he said. \"We have millions of people standing in line, taking the test, doing their background investigation, paying the fees that want to come in the right way.\" \"So if you're in the country illegally, you got a problem,\" he said. On Monday, during Trump's first day in office, acting Homeland Security Secretary Benjamine Huffman issued a directive telling immigration authorities they could conduct operations in so-called \"sensitive\" areas that he said were off-limits during the Biden administration. \"Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America's schools and churches to avoid arrest,\" he said in a statement. Others, however, said the administration was simply creating fear within the immigrant community, with the chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on Migration saying that \"turning places of care, healing and solace into places of fear and uncertainty … will note make our communities safer. He said that as they prioritize national security threats and public safety threats, ICE officers might have to even go into schools because \"many\" members of gangs tied to South and Central America, such as MS-13, are between 14 and 17 years old. In his interview with ABC News, Homan said that no other law enforcement agency is restricted from entering certain locations to promote public safety in the same way ICE has been. \"Name another agency, another law enforcement agency, that has those type of requirements, that they can't walk into a school or doctor's office or a medical campus,\" he said. \"No other agency is held to those standards.\" \"These are well-trained [ICE] officers with a lot of discretion, and when it comes to a sensitive location, there's still going to be supervisory review,\" he said. \"But ICE officers should have discretion to decide if a national security threat or a public safety threat [is] in one of these facilities.\" Homan said anyone already in the country unlawfully \"should leave,\" and those looking to claim asylum should \"do it the legal way.\" \"Go to the embassy, go to the point of entry,\" he said. \"You shouldn't come to this country and ask to get asylum and the first thing you do is break our laws by entering illegally.\" In the meantime, Homan said the Trump administration is using not just the military but the \"whole\" government, including the Justice Department, to support its mass deportation plan, which allows ICE officers to concentrate on conducting enforcement operations. But Homan acknowledged that the federal government won't be able to remove every undocumented immigrant in the U.S., and that his \"success is going to be based on what Congress gives us.\" ICE doesn't currently have enough funding from Congress to detain all of the undocumented immigrants that the Trump administration says it hopes to arrest. \"I'm being realistic,\" he said. \"We can do what we can with the money we have. We're going to try to be efficient. But with more money we have, the more we can accomplish.\" \"What price [do] you put on national security?\" he added. \"When you … don't secure that border, that's when national security threats enter the country. That's when sex trafficking goes up. That's when, you know, that's when the fentanyl comes in.\" As for what success practically looks like at the end of the Trump administration, Homan said: \"Our success every day is taking a public safety threat off the streets or getting a national security threat out of here.\" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(Neon via AP)         NEW YORK (AP) — Critics lambasted it and audiences didn’t grade it much better. But despite the turbulence,Mel Gibson’s “Flight Risk”managed to open No. 1 at the box office with a modest $12 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. On a quiet weekend, even for the typically frigid movie-going month of January, the top spot went to the Lionsgate thriller starring Mark Wahlberg as a pilot flying an Air Marshal (Michelle Dockery) and fugitive (Topher Grace) across Alaska. But it wasn’t a particularly triumphant result for Gibson’s directorial follow-up to 2016’s“Hacksaw Ridge.”Reviews (21% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores (a “C” CinemaScore) were terrible. President Donald Trumprecentlynamed Gibson a “special ambassador”to Hollywood, along with Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone. Going into the weekend, Hollywood’s attention was more focused on theSundance Film Festivaland on Thursday’sOscar nominations, which were twice postponed by thewildfires in the Los Angeles region. The weekend was also a small test as to whether the once more common Oscar “bump” that can sometimes follow nominations still exists. Most contenders have by now completed the bulk of their theatrical runs and are more likely to see an uptick on VOD or streaming. But the weekend’s most daring gambit was A24 pushingBrady Corbet’s “The Brutalist”a three–and-a-half-hour epic nominated for 10 Academy Awards, into wide release. Though some executives initially greeted “The Brutalist,” which is running with an intermission, as “un-distributable,” Corbet has said, A24 acquired the film out of the Venice Film Festival and it’s managed solid business, collecting $6 million in limited release.  In wide release, it earned $2.9 million — a far from blockbuster sum but the best weekend yet for “The Brutalist.” The audience was downright miniscule for another best-picture nominee: RaMell Ross’“Nickel Boys.”Innovatively shot almost entirely in first-person POV, the Amazon MGM Studios release gathered just $340,171 in 540 locations after expanding by 300 theaters. Coming offone of the lowest Martin Luther King Jr. weekends in years, no new releases made a major impact. Steven Soderbergh’s “Presence,”a well-reviewed horror film shot from the perspective of a ghost inside a suburban home, debuted with $3.4 million in 1,750 locations. The film, released by Neon and acquired out of last year’s Sundance, was made for just $2 million. The top spots otherwise went to holdovers. The Walt Disney Co.’s“Mufasa: The Lion King,”in its sixth weekend of release, scored $8.7 million to hold second place. After starting slow, the Barry Jenkins-directed film has amassed $626.7 million globally. “One of Them Days,”the Keke Palmer and SZA led comedy from Sony Pictures, held well in its second weekend, dropping just 32% with $8 million in ticket sales. In recent years, few comedies have found success on the big screen, but “One of Them Days” has proven an exception. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. “Flight Risk,” $12 million. 2. “Mufasa: The Lion King,” $8.7 million. 3. “One of Them Days,” $8 million. 4. “Sonic the Hedgehog 3,” $5.5 million. 5. “Moana 2,” $4.3 million. 6. “Presence,” $3.4 million. 7. “Wolf Man,” $3.4 million. 8. “A Complete Unknown,” $3.1 million. 9. “Den of Thieves 2: Pantera,” $3 million. 10. “The Brutalist,” $2.9 million.

(AP Photo/Marta Lavandier)           Dearica Hamby still smiles at the memory of Kobe Bryant sitting courtside at WNBA games. She had met him years ago. He came to see her old team, the Las Vegas Aces, play all the time. “I think one of the first things he told me was that I could play defense,” Hamby recalled. “And I was kind of like ‘Wha-at?’ ... That’s something I’ll cherish with me forever.” That epitomized the late NBA great’s relationship with the women’s game. After his 20-year playing career ended, Bryant turned his focus to the next generation, mentoring some of women’s basketball’s biggest stars, from WNBA champion and Olympic gold medalist Diana Taurasi to former Oregon star Sabrina Ionescu. He worked out with them, analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of their game and pushed for them to reach the same heights in popularity that he and his NBA peers did. For Hamby, now with the Los Angeles Sparks, Bryant saw an aspect of her game she didn’t even know she had. “If Kobe tells you you can play defense, you can play defense,” she quipped. Five years after Bryant, 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven otherswere killed in a helicopter crashin Calabasas, California, several women’s basketball players reflected on what he meant to their game and how he championed it. Many of them thought Bryant would be pleased with the overall progress of women’s sports, which haveskyrocketed in popularity and reachin recent years. That growth has been most prominent in the women’s basketball arenas that Bryant and Gianna loved so much.  The WNBA last season had its most-watched regular season in 24 years and its best attendance in 22 seasons. Some of the league’s most popular players currently are competing in a new3-on-3 leaguein South Florida called Unrivaled, founded by Olympic gold medalists Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart. “We carry this on for him,” said Satou Sabally, a forward with the WNBA’s Dallas Wings who plays for the Phantom squad in Unrivaled. “He would be so proud of this league. He would be proud of ’Phe and Stewie. I know that he’s looking down and hopefully he’s smiling and is proud of us.” Sabally said she still gets emotional when she thinks of that day on Jan. 26, 2020. It reminds her of her playing days at Oregon, when she, Ionescu and their Ducks teammates connected over Bryant. “I think about ... how we all bonded together over Kobe and how we bonded together for the rest of our lives because he was so impactful,” Sabally added. “He was really a person that saw us women as the talents who we are. He came to the games, he was so outspoken and he really was really supportive.” The shock of the superstar’s death echoed throughout the sports and entertainment worlds, with many taking to social media to post emotional tributes to Bryant while expressing their disbelief. People were glued to their phones and TV screens as news of the crash spread. NBA players were in tears ahead of games that day. “I still remember exactly where I was whenever we heard the news,” said Kate Martin of the Golden State Valkyries, playing for Laces BC at Unrivaled, “and no one really knew if it was fake or real. I think that’s just one of those things where you’re just always going to remember exactly where you were when you heard that.” Martin never met Bryant but said she cherishes his mentality — he had a relentless competitiveness — and the way he elevated women’s sports. Bryant became heavily involved with his daughters’ hoops journeys and coached Gianna’s youth team. He was often at women’s basketball games, especially college ones, with Gianna, who was fascinated with the UConn Huskies. Gianna was in line to further Bryant’s legacy on the court. The plan was for her to attend Connecticut, and surely the WNBA was next. Bryant was passionate about women’s sports despite the belief of some that he should not have been involved with the women’s game at all because of a 2003 charge accusing him of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old employee at a Colorado resort. Bryant had said the two had consensual sex, and the charge was eventually dropped when the woman declined to testify at trial. The woman later filed a civil suit against Bryant that was settled out of court. There’s an image that still circulates in the sports world today: Kobe and Gianna sitting courtside at a 2019 game featuring his Los Angeles Lakers. He wore a bright orange pullover with a white WNBA logo on the front. Gianna sat beaming at his side. “I think a lot of people started to follow behind Kobe because he recognized our gift and our talent and how special it really is,” said former Chicago Sky head coach Teresa Weatherspoon, the current coach of Unrivaled’s Vinyl BC. “And his daughter was right there as well.” That’s who Bryant had become — a face of women’s sports advocacy. “He’s greatly missed,” Martin said. “But now his legacy will live on forever.” AP WNBA:https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote Friday. Pete Hegseth was sworn in to lead the Department of Defense on Saturday, after a narrow vote in the Senate. The vote on Friday night was initially 50-50, with Vice President JD Vance then casting the tie-breaking vote. Former GOP leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, voted no. He joined Sens. Susan Collins, of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, along with all Democrats in voting against Hegseth's nomination. The former Fox News host was sworn in at the White House on Saturday morning during a ceremony officiated by Vance. \"We look forward to having the backs of our troops and having your back in executing peace through strength, in putting America first. And in rebuilding our military,” Hegseth said in remarks at the ceremony, thanking Vance and President Donald Trump. In an official statement to the department, he said: \"It is the privilege of a lifetime to lead the warriors of the Department of Defense, under the leadership of our Commander in Chief Donald J. Trump. We will put America First, and we will never back down.\" Hegseth, a former\"Fox and Friends\" television anchor, was nominated by Trump in November to lead the Defense Department. In the time since his nomination was announced, Hegseth has beenscrutinized for a number of accusationsmade against him, including those of sexual assault and financial mismanagement of two different veterans organizations. Hegseth has fiercely deniedthe allegations. He appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee for a public hearing earlier this month, where he asserted to the panel that he was a \"changed man.\" \"I am not a perfect person, but redemption is real,\" he told the panel. Speaking to reporters while on a visit to Los Angeles, Trump said he was \"very happy\" with the vote, and said he was not aware of McConnell's vote. In a statement released while the vote was still going on, McConnell said that Hegseth's desire to be a \"change agent\" was not enough to qualify him for the role of secretary of defense. \"Effective management of nearly 3 million military and civilian personnel, an annual budget of nearly $1 trillion, and alliances and partnerships around the world is a daily test with staggering consequences for the security of the American people and our global interests,\" McConnell said in the statement. \"Mr. Hegseth has failed, as yet, to demonstrate that he will pass this test. But as he assumes office, the consequences of failure are as high as they have ever been.\" Hegseth was confirmed by one of the narrowest Senate margins of any defense secretary in modern history. Most defense secretaries have been confirmed with broad bipartisan votes. Lloyd Austin, former President Joe Biden's pick for defense secretary, was confirmed in a93-2 voteand Trump's first pick for defense secretary in his first term, James Mattis, was confirmed in a98-1 vote. Before the vote, Hegseth arrived at the Capitol with his wife and children to watch the proceedings in person, a rare move for a Cabinet nominee. With the Senate's vote Friday, Hegseth becomes the third member of Trump's team to be confirmed by the Senate, following Marco Rubio as secretary of state and John Ratcliffe, as CIA director. During the same hearing, he affirmed his promise to restore the \"warfighting ethos\" of the DOD, touting his experience in the National Guard. It was enough to win over the support of most Republicans in the Senate, including several of those who were initially skeptical. \"He articulated a clear vision of the Pentagon, and it was clear to anyone who listened that he is going to bring energy and fresh ideas to shake up the department's stagnant bureaucracy,\" Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a floor speech endorsing Hegseth on Thursday. \"He will restore a warfighting ethos and relentlessly focused on the military's core mission: to deter conflict and, if necessary, to win a war.\" The Senate Armed Services Committee advanced his nomination on a party-line vote on Monday. Then, in a closely watched moment on Thursday, Hegseth's nomination passed a key test vote that set the table for Friday's vote of final passage. The nomination only required a simple majority in the Senate to advance, and it cleared the threshold narrowly, with only GOP backing. Collins and Murkowski also voted no on that occasion. In a statement, Murkowski explained that she could not support Hegseth due to concerns about this character and lack of experience. \"I believe that character is the defining trait required of the Secretary of Defense and must be prioritized without compromise,\" Murkowski said in the post. \"The leader of the Department of Defense must demonstrate and model the standards of behavior and character we expect of all servicemembers, and Mr. Hegseth's nomination to the role poses significant concerns that I cannot overlook.\" Collins took issue with comments Hegseth made in the past about his belief that women should not serve in combat roles in the military. Though Hegseth has since changed his tune on that, Collins said she was unconvinced. \"I am also concerned about multiple statements, including some in the months just before he was nominated, that Mr. Hegseth has made about women serving in the military,\" Collins said. \"He and I had a candid conversation in December about his past statements and apparently evolving views. I am not convinced that his position on women serving in combat roles has changed.\" Trump expressed confidence in Hegseth ahead of the vote on Friday, though he added, \"You'll never know what's going to happen.\" McConnell, the former GOP leader, and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, ultimately cast votes in favor of advancing Hegseth's nomination in the earlier test vote, although the presidentquestioned whether McConnell will vote noon Hegseth Friday morning. Tillis said he was still considering the most recent slate of allegations against Hegseth, leveled in an affidavit from his former sister-in-law Danielle Hegseth. In that affidavit,which ABC News obtained, Danielle Hegseth attested that Pete Hegseth's ex-wife Samantha told her she \"once hid in her closet from him because she feared for her personal safety\" in the home they shared during their marriage. It also detailed episodes of binge drinking by Pete Hegseth. An attorney for Pete Hegseth denied these allegations, and the claims of abuse were also rejected by his ex-wife. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "content": "The 17-year-old allegedly shot two classmates at his Nashville school this week. A teenager who opened fire with a 9 mm pistolin his Nashville high school cafeteriafired a total of 10 shots within 17 seconds of entering the room, according to police. Solomon Henderson, 17, had gone into a bathroom and posted photos to social media just before he went to the cafeteria and opened fire, police said. Henderson shot and killed 16-year-old Josselin Corea Escalante and shot and wounded a 17-year-old boy at Antioch High School around 11 a.m. Wednesday, according to police. Henderson died in the cafeteria from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, police said. The injured boy suffered a graze wound and was treated and released, police said. Authorities are still investigating how Henderson obtained the pistol, Nashville police said Thursday. The gun was purchased in Arizona in 2022 and was not reported stolen, police said. No firearms or firearm parts were found during Wednesday's search of Henderson's home, according to authorities. Authorities are now scouring Henderson's writings and social media presence as they investigate his ideological influences. A Pinterest account linked to Henderson features photos of past school shooters, including the shooters from Parkland, Florida, and Uvalde, Texas, a source told ABC News. Henderson's social media presence also shows he may have been in contact with 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow, whocarried out a shooting at the Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin,last month, according to law enforcement sources. Rupnow, who went by Samantha, also died after the shooting, in which two were killed and several wounded. Rupnow's account may have been following Henderson's account at the time of the Wisconsin shooting in December, according to law enforcement sources. It appears Henderson had two documents on \"non-traditional websites, one 51 pages in length, the other 288 pages,\" police said. The 51-page document expressed violent white supremacist beliefs, sources told ABC News. He expressed self-hatred as a Black person, and he wrote of wishing violence on other Black people. He also expressed violent hatred toward Jews and used antisemitic tropes and conspiracy theories to express his views, according to the sources. Henderson appeared to support neo-Nazi accelerationist and violent incel beliefs and expressed a desire to see genocide committed against racial and religious minorities, according to sources. He belonged to online communities that promote violence and extremism, sources said, and some people in those groups publicly identified Henderson as the school shooter long before his identity was confirmed by authorities.

        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "The Democratic senator also said Tulsi Gabbard isn't qualified to serve as DNI. Michigan Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin explained why she voted against confirming Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense on ABC News' \"This Week\" on Sunday, saying she had not been confident Hegseth would be more loyal to the Constitution than he would be to President Donald Trump.. Hegseth, a former Fox News host, was sworn into the role on Saturday following a razor-thin vote in the Senate. Slotkin, who joined the Senate in January and previously worked for multiple national security agencies, including the Department of Defense, told \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz that it was important in confirmation hearings that nominees knew they were \"raising your right hand and pledging an oath to the Constitution -- not Donald Trump -- and that if Donald Trump asks you to do something that contravenes the Constitution, you would push back.\" \"He couldn't unambiguously say that he will push back if the president asked him to do something that wasn't constitutional, and that, to me, is why I couldn't confirm him,\" Slotkin said. \"There's a lot of other things in his background I don't like, but I look at what is the strategic and irreversible threats to our democracy, and that's using the uniform military in ways that violate the Constitution.\" The vote to confirm Hegseth was initially 50-50 until Vice President JD Vance, in his role as president of the Senate, cast the tie-breaking vote. Every Democrat voted against Hegseth's confirmation, as did Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. His nomination process was marred by accusations ofsexual misconduct, excessive drinking and financial mismanagement of two different veterans organizations. He hasdeniedall the allegations. During Hegseth's confirmation hearing, Slotkin questioned him on whether he supports active-duty military members supporting immigrant detention centers if ordered to do so by Trump. With 1,500 soldiers and Marines now at or deploying to the border, Slotkin stressed on \"This Week\" that the military should not take on a law enforcement role in this new mission. \"According to our Constitution, you can go in supporting roles -- logistics, driving, setting up facilities, setting up, you know, border locations, whatever -- it's very different when you cross the line into law enforcement,\" she said. \"Our military are not trained as law enforcement officers -- they'll be the first one to tell you that. That's not why they got into service, and it's also in violation of our Constitution, so I think it's very important that we keep that line.\" Slotkin said it was important to know \"you're not going to use the uniform military in ways that violates the Constitution and makes American citizens scared of their own military.\" \"We were scared of the British when they occupied us,\" she said. \"We don't want to repeat that, so I'm watching that very, very closely.\" Slotkin also spoke about Tulsi Gabbard's upcoming confirmation hearing for the role of director of national intelligence. Slotkin was one of the first employees in the director's office, working there between 2005 and 2006 in between stints at the CIA as an analyst. \"I served with Tulsi Gabbard. We were on the Armed Services Committee together. She didn't spend a lot of time showing up to hearings, so I didn't get to see her in action all that much,\" Slotkin said. \"But from what I understand from people who have been meeting directly with her -- and she hasn't asked to meet with me -- is that she doesn't show the competence, the understanding, the depth. She wasn't prepared for her meetings, not to mention the deeply questionable decisions she's made of cozying up to [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, flying and cozying up with Assad in Syria.\" Slotkin said she does \"not believe [Gabbard] is qualified for this role.\" \"You know, having someone in charge of our intelligence organization that shows a preference for our adversaries, to me, is just right off the bat, a deep question,\" Slotkin said. \"And so again, I hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who now have control of the Senate, control of the House, that they think about, again, their commitment to the country, not to any one party.\" Gabbard's confirmation hearing is scheduled for Thursday before the Senate Intelligence Committee. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(Andrew Esola via AP)             ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — North America’s tallest peak is a focal point of Jeff King’s life. The four-time winner of the 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometer) Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race operates his kennel and mushing tourism business just 8 miles (12.87 kilometers) fromDenali National Park and Preserve’s entrance, and the 20,310-foot (6,190-meter) mountain looms large as he trains his dogs on nearby trails. King and many others who live in the mountain’s shadow say most Alaskans will never stop calling the peak Denali,its Alaska Native name, despitePresident Donald Trump’s executive orderthat the namerevert to Mount McKinley-- an identifier inspired byPresident William McKinley, who was from Ohio and never set foot in Alaska. For many who live near Denali, Trump’s suggestion was peculiar. “I don’t know a single person that likes the idea, and we’re pretty vocal about it,” King said. “Denali respects the Indigenous people that have been here and around Denali for tens of thousands of years.” The mountain was named after McKinleywhen a prospector walked out of the Alaska wildernessin 1896, and the first news he heard was that the Republican had been nominated for president. The name was quickly challenged, but maps had already been circulated with the mountain’s name in place. At the time, there was no recognition of the name Denali, or “the high one,” bestowed on the mountain in interior Alaska by Athabascan tribal members, who have lived in the region for centuries.  The McKinley name stuck until 2015, whenPresident Barack Obama’s administrationchanged it to Denali as a symbolic gesture to Alaska Natives on the eve of his Alaska visit tohighlight climate change. Trump said he issued the order to “restore the name of a great president, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs. President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent.” The area lies solely in the United States, and Trump, as president, has the authority to change federal geographical names within the country. In Ohio, Trump’s move drew praise. “I was really excited to see President Trump do that executive order,” former U.S. Rep. Bob Gibbs, R-Ohio, told The Associated Press by telephone Thursday. McKinley “was a great president,” Gibbs said. “It was the appropriate thing to do.” That’s not how Alaskans see it. Trump injected “a jarring note” into Alaska affairs, Steve Haycox, professor emeritus of history at the University of Alaska Anchorage, wrote inthe Anchorage Daily News. “Historical analysis confirms that William McKinley is the wrong public figure for Alaskans to commemorate,” he said. McKinley served as president from 1897 until he was assassinated in 1901. He was an imperial colonialist who oversaw the expansion of the American empire with the occupation of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Philippines andHawaii, pushed by business interests and Christian missionaries wanting to convert Indigenous peoples, Haycox said. “Trump’s push to rescind the name Denali for the colonialist and white elitist McKinley is insulting to all Alaskans, especially to Alaska’s Native people, and should be soundly rejected,” Haycox said. John Wayne Howe, who unsuccessfully ran for U.S. House last year representing the Alaskan Independence Party, which holds that Alaskans should be allowed to vote on becoming an independent nation, said he is tired of “people changing the names of stuff, period.” He also is not in favor of naming anything after people because “the persons that we consider absolutely perfect change over time, and it just leads to confusion.” Howe said he prefers Denali because he knows McKinley’s history and it’s the name most preferred by Alaskans. This past week, two resolutions were introduced in the Alaska Legislature to keep the name Denali. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Trump ally who praised another order by the president aimed at spurring resource development in the state, said he had not had a chance to speak with Trump about the issue but hoped to have a conversation next month in Washington about what Denali means to Alaskans, Americans and “our Native folks.” But Sarah Palin, a former Republican governor who is also a Trump supporter, said the McKinley name should never have been removed. Palin’s Secret Service code name was Denali in 2008 when she was GOP presidential nominee John McCain’s running mate the year they lost to Obama and Joe Biden. But in an interview with Al Arabiya News this past week, Palin said she didn’t see why the mountain’s name needed to be changed to begin with. “It’s always been Mount McKinley,” said Palin, who didn’t respond to a message from The Associated Press. “Nobody was begging for a change in name in that peak. Just put it back the way it was, more common sense.” Alaska’s U.S. senators, Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, have supported the name Denali. U.S. Rep. Nick Begich, a first-term Republican, sidestepped the debate. “I’m focused on job creation, opportunities in Alaska,” Begich told Politico. “And what we call a mountain in Alaska is of little concern to me.” The Alaska Native Heritage Center, the statewide Indigenous cultural center in Anchorage, supports preserving Indigenous place names. “Restoring and honoring them acknowledges the deep, millennia-old connection Indigenous peoples maintain with these lands and is a step toward respect and reconciliation,” the center’s president, Emily Edenshaw, said in a statement. The quirky Alaska community of Talkeetna, about 140 miles (225.3 kilometers) south of the park and wherea cat was once mayor, is the jumping off point for climbers before making the ascent of the peak. The historic community long rumored to be the inspiration for the 1990s television series “Northern Exposure” is also a popular tourist stop. Joe McAneney of Talkeetna worked as a summer raft-guide for two years before moving to Alaska full time in 2012. He’s now a pilot for an air taxi company, ferrying climbers and tourists to the mountain in a small airplane outfitted with skis to land atbase camp, located on Kahiltna Glacierat 7,200 feet (2,194.6 meters) above sea level. He knows once tourist season comes around, he will have to answer their questions of what he thinks about Trump changing the name. He knows what his answer will be. “It’s always been Denali, and it always will be,” he said. The executive order can instigate the name change, but compliance is another issue. “The only people that are going to adhere to that are probably the people that would have been still calling it McKinley anyway,” McAneney said There is a long-standing Alaska trait of ignoring what the rest of the world thinks, and it’s usually expressed like this: “We don’t care how they do it Outside.” Outside, which is always capitalized, refers to every place that is not Alaska. “I think unofficially and officially in Alaska, it’ll always be Denali,” McAneney said. “I don’t think the president can change that.” For King, the decorated Iditarod musher and fan favorite, Trump’s decision had a whiff of arrogance. “I’m surprised he doesn’t want to name it Trump Mountain,” he said.

        "content": "Tom Homan spoke with ABC's Martha Raddatz for \"This Week.\" The Trump administration is planning to use military aircraft every day to help carry out what PresidentDonald Trumpand his \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, have promised will be the largest deportation operation in U.S. history, Homan told ABC News. In an interview with ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz, Homan said that only days after Trump took office, the U.S. government for the first time ever used military aircraft to transport migrants back to their home country, and it will now be a daily occurrence. According to U.S. officials, the U.S. military on Thursday flew more than 150 migrants to Guatemala on two separate flights. But Homan made clear that the military flights are just one part of a much broader plan. He claimed that – unlike under the Biden administration –Immigrationand Customs Enforcement officers are now free to arrest any of the estimated more than 11 million immigrants in the country without legal status, not just those identified as priorities for deportation for being convicted criminals or other public safety threats. Watch more of Martha Raddatz' interview with Tom Homan Sunday on ABC's 'This Week' \"If you're in the country illegally, you're on the table because it's not okay to, you know, violate the laws of this country,\" he said. Homan said that while the Trump administration's enforcement actions are currently prioritizing public safety and national security threats, they're going to \"open up the aperture\" in the weeks and months ahead. \"As that aperture opens, there'll be more arrests nationwide,\" he said. Homan also offered another possible solution for \"those who are in the country illegally\": They \"should leave\" on their own, he said. Early in the Biden administration, then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas issued guidance to immigration enforcement officers discouraging them from \"spending resources to remove those who do not pose a threat\" and noting that many undocumented immigrants inside the country \"have been here for generations and contributed to our country's well-being,\" as he put it in a statement at the time. Homan, however, noted that the nation’s immigration laws were passed by Congress to be enforced, and said immigrants without legal status are violating those laws.

        "content": "Officials say they have recaptured the final four monkeys who escaped two months ago from a South Carolina compound that breeds them for medical research YEMASSEE, S.C. --Authorities in South Carolina said Friday the last four of 43 escaped monkeys have been recaptured after two months living in the woods, weathering arare snowstormand being temped back into captivity by peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. The rhesus macaque monkeys, all females, made a break for it after police say an employee did notfully lock their enclosureat Alpha Genesis, a facility that breeds them for medical research — known to locals as “the monkey farm.” The recaptured monkeys appeared to be in good health, Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard said in a statement relayed by Yemassee Police in a social media post, without further details. While they were on the loose, the area saw its first snow in seven years, accumulating up to 3 inches (8 centimeters). The rhesus macaques made a break for it on Nov. 6, and mostly hung around near the facility. They're about the size of a cat, weighing roughly 7 pounds (3 kilograms). It appears a worker unintentionally left the gates unlocked when the monkeys escaped, Westergaard said in November. Workers were supposed to lock and latch one gate before opening another, but all three gates and latches were left unsecure. The monkeys posed no risk to public health, said Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police. Alpha Guard employees kept an eye on the monkeys and set out humane traps. Most were lured back with food and were given peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and \"monkey biscuits\" — a high-protein Purina Monkey Chow specially formulated for the rhesus macaques. The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical facilities and other researchers. Humans have beenusing the monkeys for scientific researchsince the late 1800s. Scientists believe rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25 million years ago and share about 93% of the same DNA. The compound is about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee and about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(Photo by CJ Rivera/Invision/AP)                     NEW YORK (AP) — To celebrate an upcoming milestone, Alyssa Math could think of nothing more fitting than front-row tickets to “Onyx Storm” author Rebecca Yarros’ appearance at The Town Hall in Manhattan. “I’m getting married next weekend, so this is my bachelorette party,” said Math, an accountant who traveled with friends from her home near Annapolis, Maryland. She has been one of millions of admirers of Yarros’ work and a year ago drove two hours to Reston, Virginia, to see the author. “It’s a huge cult following,” said Math, wearing a white veil in homage to one of Yarros’ characters. “The drama (of her books) keeps you on the edge of your seat.” Friday night at The Town Hall had the feel of a costume party, rock concert and family reunion as a capacity crowd of around 1,500 clapped, laughed and shouted, “Yes, Queen!” The “Empyrean” series has made Yarros one of the country’s most popular and obsessed-about leaders of romantasy, a newly branded genre combinging romance and fantasy. “Onyx Storm” is the much-awaited third installment of a planned five centered on the lovers Violet and Xaden, and the first since the million-selling “Iron Flame” came out in 2023. In its first week of publication, “Onyx Storm” has already topped the bestseller lists of Amazon and sold more than 300,000 copies just through Barnes & Noble, according to a spokesperson for the superstore chain. Yarros, interviewed for some 75 minutes by Olympic gymnast and avowed fan Laurie Hernandez, shared a few insights about her writings (she already knows how the series will end), spoke lovingly of her husband (“He’s 6'4\" and hot as hell with a baby strapped to his chest”), swore casually and joked that hers was the “only profession where you can have imaginary fiends” and not be considered insane.  She expressed relief and pleasure over completing “Onyx Storm,” noting she had to block out her own popularity to get the writing done. “As much as I love you guys, I kind of pretend you don’t exist,” she said. “I kind of ignore you, but I love you at the same time.” “Onyx Storm” isn’t quite a Harry Potter-level phenomenon — the final Potter book byJ.K. Rowling, “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” sold more than 8 million copies in the U.S. in its first 24 hours — but it carries a similar feeling of obsession, identification and spontaneity. Like the Potter books, the release of “Onyx Storm” was welcomed with midnight store parties around the country, gatherings for which fans showed up in costume. Some fans at The Town Hall finished the 526-page “Onyx Storm” within hours of receiving it, others are in no hurry. “This is a book I personally want to take my time with,” said Scarlett Fuentes, who arrived with her friend Zy Bao-angan, both of them in black leather. “I want to savor this moment,” Bao-angan said. Like Potter, enthusiasm for the Yarros books extends well beyond any organized publicity campaigns. The Potter books helped inspire some of the first Internet fan sites for books. Yarros and such fellow romantasy authors asSarah J. Maashave been favorites of the young readers on BookTok, a TikTok community that has emerged as publishing’s most effective driver of sales. Countless fans on BookTok and other social media — some crying, some cursing in amazement — have been posting their responses to “Onyx Storm.” On Friday, Hernandez and the audience posed questions about her books as if gossiping about friends. If Violet and Xaden were at a bar, what would they order? Violet would go for a lavender lemon drop, Xaden is fine with a beer. And which music genres define them? Xenon is heavy metal, Violet harder to label. Asked what was the most important lessons she has learned from writing the books, Yarros reminded her fans that she wasn’t only a writer or public figure. “I can say plotting and I can say everything, but probably the most important thing I’ve learned is that real life is what happens in my house, and what happens around my kitchenette and what happens in my living room chairs and what happens when my kids are all together and my husband’s together,” she said. “Real life is not what happens on the internet.” “I love you guys,” she added. “But peace out.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/John Raoux)     DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Roger Penske started his 59th season in motorsports the same way he closed last year — as a champion. Porsche Penske Motorsport on Sunday won the Rolex 24 at Daytona for the second consecutive year, and third time overall, to continue the domination “The Captain” flexed all of last season. Penske opened 2024 by winning the most prestigious sports car race in North America, added a 20th victory in the Indianapolis 500, won a second consecutive NASCAR championship and his pair of Porsches won both the World Endurance Championship title and the IMSA crown. Now back at Daytona International Speedway for the Rolex, the same place and race where Team Penske debuted in 1966, Penske returned to victory lane. And, as he always does, the billionaire who turns 88 next month stayed awake and sat with the team on the timing stand for the entire 24 hours. His two cars dominated the twice-round-the-clock endurance race and finished 1-2. Once attrition hit other entries in the top prototype class, the Porsches ran first and second for large portions of the race. It was the No. 7 full-time IMSA entry that won, making it back-to-back victories for that car despite a different driver lineup. Felipe Nasr won last year with Dane Cameron and Josef Newgarden, but Cameron was let go at the end of 2024 and Newgarden wasn’t part of this year’s Rolex lineup. So it was Nasr again, only this time he was paired with Nick Tandy, who will be his IMSA co-driver all season, and Laurens Vanthoor, Penske’s reigning WEC champion.  It was Nasr’s second overall victory, and he also won a Rolex watch for a class victory in 2022. Tandy also earned a Rolex with a 2014 class victory, but Sunday was his first overall win. It was the first watch for Vanthoor, who had finished in the top five of class in six of the last seven years. Nasr said it is Penske who pushes the team to achieve the excellence he demands. “The feeling is amazing, just to see how much energy he brings into the team. You get out of the car, he’s like: ‘How’s the car? How’s the handling?’ Like, he’s very interested in every detail,” Nasr said. “He doesn’t miss a pit stop when the cars are coming in, and he’s looking at it all and making comments. I just have a lot of admiration for everything he does, and it stands for the team. It’s a very, very unique opportunity to be driving for Porsche Penske Motorsport here.” Even though the No. 7 was so dominant — especially after sunrise on Sunday — the drivers were still challenged until the checkered flag. Penske’s No. 6 car took the lead with just under an hour to go, but Nasr bested Matt Campbell in a drag race through traffic to cycle back to the front with about 22 minutes remaining. BMW M Team RLL had a pair of competitive entries and one of its cars went wheel-to-wheel with Nasr for the lead with about 100 minutes remaining. Getting the win Sunday meant beating 60 other cars in a field of 235 drivers representing 31 countries. The lineups included 14 former Formula 1 drivers, including Nasr. Kevin Magnussen, who concluded his 10-year F1 career in December, has the most recent experience in motorsports’ elite global series and was a contender with BMW for overall victory. Rahal’s two cars led and contended with the Porsches but had issues that prevented them from keeping consistent pace with the Penske entries. Same for Meyer Shank Racing, which had a suspension issue early Saturday that took one car out of contention, then its second car suffered front damage when Felix Rosenqvist was leading. All three Cadillacs in the prototype class had issues — one of Wayne Taylor Racing’s entries was knocked out of the race Saturday night not long after two-time Rolex winner Kamui Kobayashi had driven it to the lead.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)               SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean prosecutors on Sunday indictedimpeached President Yoon Suk Yeolon rebellion in connection with his short-lived imposition of martial law, a criminal charge that could incur the death penalty or life imprisonment if convicted. This is thelatest blow to Yoon, who was impeached and arrested over his Dec. 3 martial law decree that plunged the country intopolitical turmoil, shook its financial markets and hurt its international image. Separate from criminal judicial proceedings, the Constitutional Court is now deliberating whether to formally dismiss Yoon as president or reinstate him. Yoon has become South Korea’s first president who has been indicted while in office. He will remain jailed and be escorted from a detention facility to a Seoul court for hearings in the trial, which is expected to last about six months. Prosecutors said in a statement that they indicted Yoon on charges that he directed a rebellion when he imposed martial law. Investigative authorities have earlier alleged that Yoon’s imposition of martial law amounted to rebellion, because he staged riots with the purpose of undermining the constitution. Yoon’s defense team lashed out at the indictment, calling it “the worst decision” by prosecutors who they say are trying to curry favor with political forces who want Yoon’s exit. “Today’s indictment of the president will remain as a shame in the history of South Korean prosecutors that they cannot erase,” Yoon’s defense team said in a statement. “We stress once again that a president’s declaration of martial law can never be rebellion.”  Yoon has presidential immunity from most criminal prosecutions, but the privilege doesn’t extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. By law in South Korea, the leader of a rebellion can face a life sentence or capital punishment. Yoon, a conservative, has steadfastlydenied any wrongdoing, describing his declaration of martial law as a legitimate act of governance meant to raise public awareness of the danger of the liberal-controlled National Assembly, which obstructed his agenda and impeached top officials. During his announcement of martial law, Yoon called the assembly “a den of criminals” and vowed to eliminate “shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces.” After declaring martial law on Dec. 3, Yoon sent troops and police officers to the assembly, but enough lawmakers still managed to enter an assembly chamber to vote down Yoon’s decree unanimously, forcing his Cabinet to lift it. The martial law imposition,the first of its kindin South Korea in more than four decades, lasted only six hours. However, it evoked painful memories of past dictatorial rules in South Korea in the 1960s-80s when military-backed rulers used martial laws and emergency decrees to suppress opponents. South Korea’s constitution gives the president the power to declare martial law to keep order in wartime and other comparable emergency states, but many experts say the country wasn’t under such conditions when Yoon declared martial law. Yoon insists that he hadno intentions of disrupting assembly work, including its floor vote on his decree and that deploying troops and police forces was meant to maintain order. But commanders of military units sent to the assembly have told assembly hearings or investigators that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to prevent them from overturning his decree. Investigations on Yoon have intensified the country’s already serious internal division,with rival protestersregularly staging rallies in downtown Seoul. After a local court on Jan. 19 approved a formal arrest warrant to extend Yoon’s detention, dozens of his supporters stormed the court building, destroying windows, doors and other property. They also attacked police officers with bricks, steel pipes and other objects. The violence left 17 police officers injured, and police said that they detained 46 protesters. Yoon earlier resisted efforts by investigative authorities to question or detain him.He then was apprehended on Jan. 15in a huge law enforcement operation at his presidential compound. Leading Yoon’s investigation was the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, but Yoon has refused to attend CIO questioning sessions since being detained, saying it has no legal authority to investigate rebellion allegations. The CIO has said that it can investigate Yoon’s rebellion allegation because it’s related to his purported abuse of power and other allegations. The CIO handed over Yoon’s case to the Seoul prosecutors’ office on Friday and asked it to indict him on charges of rebellion, abuse of power and obstruction of the National Assembly. Prosecutors said they indicted Yoon only on rebellion, considering that Yoon had presidential immunity from other charges. Yoon’s defense minister, police chief and several other military commanders have already been arrested on alleged rebellion, abuse of power and other charges related to the martial law decree. If the Constitutional Court rules to drive Yoon out of office, a national election to choose his successor must be held within two months. Recent public surveys show that governing and opposition party candidates are running neck-and-neck in a possible presidential by-election race.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Video shot by Bassam Al Masri)                                     DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel kept thousands of Palestinians from returning to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday as it accused Hamas of violatinga fragile ceasefireby changing the order of hostages it has released. Local health officials said Israeli forces fired on the crowd, killing two people and wounding nine. Israeli forcesalso opened fire in Lebanonon protesters demanding their withdrawal by Sunday’s deadline under a separate ceasefire with the Hezbollah militant group. Health officials in Lebanon said at least 22 people were killed and over 120 wounded. Israel says it hasn’t withdrawn because Lebanese forces are not deploying quickly enough, while Lebanon says its forces cannot move into areas until Israeli troops leave. U.S. President Donald Trump meanwhile suggested that most of Gaza’s populationbe at least temporarily resettled elsewhere, including in Egypt and Jordan, to “just clean out” the war-ravaged enclave. Jordan and the Palestinians swiftly rejected that, and Egypt has previously rejected the scenario, fearing Israelmight never allow refugees to return. Senior Hamas official Bassem Naim said Palestinians would never accept such a proposal, “even if seemingly well-intentioned under the guise of reconstruction.” He said the Palestinians can rebuild Gaza “even better than before”if Israel lifts its blockade. Under the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, Israel on Saturday was to begin allowing Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza throughthe Netzarim corridorbisecting the territory. Israel put that on hold until Hamas frees a civilian hostage who Israel said should have been released Saturday. Hamas accused Israel of violating the agreement.  Crowds of people carrying their belongings filled a main road leading to a closed Israeli checkpoint. “We have been in agony for a year and a half,” said Nadia Qasem. Fadi al-Sinwar, also displaced from Gaza City, said “the fate of more than a million people is linked to one person,” referring to the Israeli hostage, Arbel Yehoud. “See how valuable we are? We are worthless,” he said. Israeli forces fired on the crowds on three occasions overnight and into Sunday, killing two people and wounding nine, including a child, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. Israel’s military in a statement said it fired warning shots at “several gatherings of dozens of suspects who were advancing toward the troops and posed a threat to them.” Israel has pulled back from several areas of Gaza under the ceasefire, which came into effect last Sunday. The military has warned people to stay away from its forces, which still operate in a buffer zone inside Gaza along the border and in the Netzarim corridor. Hamasfreed four female Israeli soldierson Saturday, and Israel released some 200 Palestinian prisoners, most of whom were serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks. But Israel said Yehoud should have been released ahead of the soldiers. The release of four Israeli hostages Saturday comes nearly a week into a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and is part of a long and uncertain process aimed at eventually ending the war. The AP’s Sam Mednick explains. Israel also accused Hamas of failing to provide details on the conditions of hostages set to be freed in the remaining five weeks of the ceasefire’s first phase. In a statement, Hamas said it had told mediators — the United States, Egypt and Qatar — that Yehoud was alive and provided guarantees that she would be released. A spokesman for Gaza’s second-largest militant group, Islamic Jihad, later said the dispute over Yehoud had been settled. Mohamed al-Hajj Mousa said the group told mediators she will be released before Saturday. But an Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the behind-the-scenes talks, said there was still no deal. The ceasefire is aimed at ending the 15-month war triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack and freeing hostages still held in Gaza in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Around 90 hostages are still in Gaza, and Israeli authorities believe at least a third, and up to half, have died. Itzik Horn, the father of hostages Iair and Eitan Horn, called any resumption of fighting “a death sentence for the hostages” and criticized government ministers who want the war to go on. The ceasefire’s first phase runs until early March and includes the release of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The second — and far more difficult — phase, has yet to be negotiated. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining hostages without an end to the war, while Israel has threatened to resume its offensive until Hamas is destroyed. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 attack, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. More than 100 were freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the remains of dozens more, at least three of them mistakenly killed by Israeli forces. Seven have been freed in the latest ceasefire. Israel’s military campaign has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not say how many of the dead were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. Israeli bombardment and ground operationshave flattened wide swaths of Gazaand displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. Many who have returned home since the ceasefire began have found only mounds of rubble. Magdy reported from Cairo and Krauss from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)         WASHINGTON (AP) — Two months ago, in his first network television interview after the election,Donald Trumpsaid he owed his victory to Americans’ anger over immigration and inflation, specifically the rising cost of groceries. “When you buy apples, when you buy bacon, when you buy eggs, they would double and triple the price over a short period of time,” he told NBC’s “Meet the Press. “And I won an election based on that. We’re going to bring those prices way down.” But in Trump’s first week back in the White House, there was little in his initial blitz ofexecutive ordersthat directly tackled those prices, besides directing federal agencies to start“pursuing appropriate actions.”He is taking steps to lower energy costs, something that Trump hopes will have ripple effects throughout the economy. Otherwise, his focus has been clamping down on immigration, which he described as his “No. 1 issue” shortly after taking the oath of office. “They all said inflation was the No. 1 issue. I said, ‘I disagree,’” Trump said. “I talked about inflation too, but how many times can you say that an apple has doubled in cost?” Trump is banking on voters giving him a pass andcontinuing to blame former President Joe Bidenfor high prices. The Republican’s comments reflect the reality that presidents have almost no levers to reduce inflation quickly without causing collateral damage to other parts of the economy.  There is more that Trump can do on energy. He is pushing to reduce regulations andincrease the amount of landavailable for drilling. He is trying to persuade domestic and foreign oil producers to potentially sacrifice their own profitsby pumping more. During a rally Saturday in Las Vegas, Trump went after his Democratic predecessor for allowing prices to rise under his watch, and promised to take care of the problem quickly. “When I think of Biden, I think of incompetence and inflation,” Trump said. Inflation peaked at a 9.1% annual rate in June 2022 during worldwide supply chain problems after the economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. Overall consumer prices have fallen since then, but have ticked up in recent months, from 2.4% in September to 2.9% in December, the latest figures available. Economists have warned that Trump’s plans for tariffs and tax cuts could create new inflationary pressures and keep interest rates elevated. Vice President JD Vance, in an interview with CBS’ “Face the Nation” airing Sunday, defended the White House’s work so far. “Prices are going to come down, but it’s going to take a little bit of time, right?” he said. He added, “Rome wasn’t built in a day.” Trump’s relative shift away from addressing costs could create an opening for Democrats to say he is not helping working-class voters, hoping that argument could offer the party a path back to power in Washington. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said Trump preferred to distract people from inflation with talk of adding Greenland to the United States or seizing the Panama Canal. “It’s catnip and it causes everybody to stop paying attention to their actual economic agenda, which has nothing to do with lowering costs and everything to do with rigging the economy to help the Mar-a-Lago crowd,” he said. During an interview on Fox News this past week, host Sean Hannity struggled to get Trump to focus on the economy. “Let me get to the economy,” Hannity said at one point. “I’m running out of time.” “The economy is going to do great,” Trump insisted. When Trump did talk about inflation in the interview, he noted how low it was during his first term and insisted prices would not have jumped up if he had president after the 2020 election, even though higher inflation was a global trend coming out of the pandemic. It is not clear how Trump would persuade oil companies and foreign countries to quickly increase production, possibly costing them profits. The Energy Information Administration reported that domestic oil production has grown at an annual rate of roughly 8.4% over the past two years to an average of nearly 13.5 million barrels a day in October. Some Trump aides suggest that could increase by an additional 3 million barrels a day. It would be difficult to achieve that much additional production in a single year without serious changes to the global market. The International Energy Agency estimates that the oil supplied to the entire world will increase by 1.8 million barrels per day to 104.7 million barrels a day. He also has expressed opposition to climate-friendlier wind and solar energy, putting more pressure on the U.S. economy to rely on fossil fuels. EJ Antoni, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, said the potential increase in energy production under Trump would ultimately flow through the economy in the form of lower prices. “If you’re going to bring down the cost of energy, you’re going to bring down the cost of all kinds of goods and services,” he said. But there is a risk that some of Trump’s plans taken as a whole could raise — not reduce — prices. Deporting migrants who are in the United States illegally could deprive companies of lower wage workers. The cost of tariffs, which are taxes placed on foreign imports, could be passed on to consumers. Trump said that his strategy also might ultimately involvepublicly pressuring the Federal Reserveto cut interest rates, saying in Davos that he would “demand” lower rates from central banks. The Fed sees its political independence as key for making tough choices to stabilize prices. Biden saw the independence as worth protecting, whereas Trump sees it as problematic. The Fed raised its benchmark rates starting in 2022 to make it more expensive to borrow and succeeded enough in reducing inflationary pressures that it could trim rates late last year. Trump believes that greater oil production will put him in a position to tell the Fed what to do. Asked in the Oval Office if he expects the Fed to listen to him, Trump simply said, “Yeah.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Brittany Peterson)             LOS ANGELES (AP) — After weeks of windy and dry weather, rain has fallen in parched Southern California and is expected to aid firefighters who are mopping up multiple wildfires. But potentially heavy downpours on charred hillsides could bring new troubles such astoxic ash runoff. Los Angeles County crews spent much of the past week removing vegetation, shoring up slopes and reinforcing roads in devastated areas of thePalisades and Eaton fires, which reduced entire neighborhoods to rubble and ash after breaking out during powerful winds Jan. 7. Most of the region was forecast to get around an inch (about 2.5 centimeters) of precipitation over several days, but “the threat is high enough to prepare for the worst-case scenario” of localized cloudbursts causing mud and debris to flow down hills, the National Weather Service said on social media. “So the problem would be if one of those showers happens to park itself over a burn area,” weather service meteorologist Carol Smith said. “That could be enough to create debris flows.” Rainfall that began late Saturday was expected to increase Sunday and possibly last into early Tuesday, forecasters said. Flood watches were issued for some burn areas, while snow was likely in the mountains. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bassissued an executive order last weekto expedite cleanup efforts and mitigate the environmental impacts of fire-related pollutants. LA County supervisors also approved an emergency motion to install flood-control infrastructure and expedite and remove sediment in fire-impacted areas.  Fire crews filled sandbags for communities, while county workers installed barriers and cleared drainage pipes and basins. Officials cautioned that ash in recent burn zones wasa toxic mixof incinerated cars, electronics, batteries, building materials, paints, furniture and other household items. It contains pesticides, asbestos, plastics and lead. Residents were urged to wear protective gear while cleaning up. Concerns about post-fire debris flows have been especially high since 2018, when the town of Montecito, up the coast from LA, wasravaged by mudslidesafter a downpour hit mountain slopes burned bare by a huge blaze. Hundreds of homes were damaged and 23 people died. While the impending wet weather ended weeks of dangerous gusts and reduced humidity, several wildfires were still burning Saturday across Southern California. Those included the Palisades and Eaton fires, whichkilled at least 28 peopleand destroyed more than 14,000 structures. Containment of the Palisades Fire reached 81% on Saturday and the Eaton Fire was 95% contained. Smoke plumes rise from a hill Thursday, Jan. 23, 2025 in Camarillo, Calif., where the Laguna Fire fire broke out.

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)  In northern Los Angeles County, firefighters made significant progress against the Hughes Fire, which prompted evacuations for tens of thousands of people when it erupted on Wednesday in mountains near Lake Castaic. In San Diego County, there was still little containment of the Border 2 Fire as it burned through a remote area of the Otay Mountain Wilderness near the U.S.-Mexico border. The rain was expected to snap a near-record streak of dry weather for Southern California. Much of the region has received less than 5% of the average rainfall for this point in the water year, which began Oct. 1, the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday. Most of Southern California is currently in “extreme drought” or “severe drought,” according to theU.S. Drought Monitor.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(Photo by CJ Rivera/Invision/AP)                     NEW YORK (AP) — To celebrate an upcoming milestone, Alyssa Math could think of nothing more fitting than front-row tickets to “Onyx Storm” author Rebecca Yarros’ appearance at The Town Hall in Manhattan. “I’m getting married next weekend, so this is my bachelorette party,” said Math, an accountant who traveled with friends from her home near Annapolis, Maryland. She has been one of millions of admirers of Yarros’ work and a year ago drove two hours to Reston, Virginia, to see the author. “It’s a huge cult following,” said Math, wearing a white veil in homage to one of Yarros’ characters. “The drama (of her books) keeps you on the edge of your seat.” Friday night at The Town Hall had the feel of a costume party, rock concert and family reunion as a capacity crowd of around 1,500 clapped, laughed and shouted, “Yes, Queen!” The “Empyrean” series has made Yarros one of the country’s most popular and obsessed-about leaders of romantasy, a newly branded genre combinging romance and fantasy. “Onyx Storm” is the much-awaited third installment of a planned five centered on the lovers Violet and Xaden, and the first since the million-selling “Iron Flame” came out in 2023. In its first week of publication, “Onyx Storm” has already topped the bestseller lists of Amazon and sold more than 300,000 copies just through Barnes & Noble, according to a spokesperson for the superstore chain. Yarros, interviewed for some 75 minutes by Olympic gymnast and avowed fan Laurie Hernandez, shared a few insights about her writings (she already knows how the series will end), spoke lovingly of her husband (“He’s 6'4\" and hot as hell with a baby strapped to his chest”), swore casually and joked that hers was the “only profession where you can have imaginary fiends” and not be considered insane.  She expressed relief and pleasure over completing “Onyx Storm,” noting she had to block out her own popularity to get the writing done. “As much as I love you guys, I kind of pretend you don’t exist,” she said. “I kind of ignore you, but I love you at the same time.” “Onyx Storm” isn’t quite a Harry Potter-level phenomenon — the final Potter book byJ.K. Rowling, “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” sold more than 8 million copies in the U.S. in its first 24 hours — but it carries a similar feeling of obsession, identification and spontaneity. Like the Potter books, the release of “Onyx Storm” was welcomed with midnight store parties around the country, gatherings for which fans showed up in costume. Some fans at The Town Hall finished the 526-page “Onyx Storm” within hours of receiving it, others are in no hurry. “This is a book I personally want to take my time with,” said Scarlett Fuentes, who arrived with her friend Zy Bao-angan, both of them in black leather. “I want to savor this moment,” Bao-angan said. Like Potter, enthusiasm for the Yarros books extends well beyond any organized publicity campaigns. The Potter books helped inspire some of the first Internet fan sites for books. Yarros and such fellow romantasy authors asSarah J. Maashave been favorites of the young readers on BookTok, a TikTok community that has emerged as publishing’s most effective driver of sales. Countless fans on BookTok and other social media — some crying, some cursing in amazement — have been posting their responses to “Onyx Storm.” On Friday, Hernandez and the audience posed questions about her books as if gossiping about friends. If Violet and Xaden were at a bar, what would they order? Violet would go for a lavender lemon drop, Xaden is fine with a beer. And which music genres define them? Xenon is heavy metal, Violet harder to label. Asked what was the most important lessons she has learned from writing the books, Yarros reminded her fans that she wasn’t only a writer or public figure. “I can say plotting and I can say everything, but probably the most important thing I’ve learned is that real life is what happens in my house, and what happens around my kitchenette and what happens in my living room chairs and what happens when my kids are all together and my husband’s together,” she said. “Real life is not what happens on the internet.” “I love you guys,” she added. “But peace out.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

        "content": "Palestinians face challenges of rebuilding lives torn apart by Gaza war. Gaza has become a wasteland of ruins and rubble due to Israel's conflict with Hamas following the terror organization's surprise attack on Oct. 7, 2023. However, now that a ceasefire is in place, families are returning to their neighborhoods, hoping to rebuild the places they once called home. One of the families excited to be back is the Ghaly family. After leaving the tents they had lived in for months, they are taking the few possessions they still have. As they returned to see the rubble, evidence of the destructive force where no building was left untouched, they also saw their family home. \"This is our four-story home,\" Eyad Abu Ghaly said. \"It has been completely flattened, and there was no reason for that. We don’t understand why the house was bombed.\" Eyad further explains, “The resistance does not exist here — just civilians.” Many homes that are still standing are wrecked inside, and as people wonder how they will ever rebuild, there’s also fear that war will soon return. \"I look at young people and wonder, 'Where will they go?'\" Ghaly said. \"There’s no future for them — no education, no health care. There is no life, no life at all.\" The agreement between Hamas and Israel, which ended the fighting and resulted in three Israeli hostages being freed on Sunday and reuniting with their families, was initially based on a six-week ceasefire. On Inauguration Day, President Donald Trump stated he was not confident that a second phase of the deal could be reached to prolong the truce and free all remaining hostages, both living and deceased. Tal Haimi was killed in the Oct. 7 massacre, but his body was taken into Gaza by Hamas. His cousin, Udi Goren, said that if Israel prioritizes the release of all hostages, it will further weaken Hamas. \"It is in our interest,\" Goren said. \"Bring back the hostages because that's more valuable to Hamas than anything else. And once we have the hostages back home, then we need to keep doing what we're actually doing right now, collaborating with the mediators in creating a different future for Gaza, where Hamas is not a part of it.\" But as soon as the ceasefire kicked in in Gaza, Hamas gunmen were parading through the streets. Then, the hostage handover was used to show they were back in charge. With no sign that Hamas is willing to capitulate, a former Israeli general close to the Israeli government states that it is unlikely the six-week ceasefire will be prolonged. Retired Israel Defense Forces Brigadier General Amir Avivi told ABC News that Israel is discussing a second deal. Yet this deal involves not just the release of hostages, but also requires Hamas to surrender, relinquish its control over Gaza, and vacate the area. \"And we will have to pressure and continue degrading Hamas capabilities to an extent where they will understand that it's game over,\" Avivi said. While teams in Gaza search the rubble for more bodies, there is no clear sense of who or what could govern Gaza if Hamas were to be removed. According to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, the war has already claimed 47,000 lives. Some 1,200 were killed in southern Israel during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, according to Israeli officials. In examining Gaza before the war and observing the devastation now, aid agencies warn that thousands more dead have not yet been counted or found. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "content": "Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote Friday. Pete Hegseth was sworn in to lead the Department of Defense on Saturday, after a narrow vote in the Senate. The vote on Friday night was initially 50-50, with Vice President JD Vance then casting the tie-breaking vote. Former GOP leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, voted no. He joined Sens. Susan Collins, of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, along with all Democrats in voting against Hegseth's nomination. The former Fox News host was sworn in at the White House on Saturday morning during a ceremony officiated by Vance. \"We look forward to having the backs of our troops and having your back in executing peace through strength, in putting America first. And in rebuilding our military,” Hegseth said in remarks at the ceremony, thanking Vance and President Donald Trump. In an official statement to the department, he said: \"It is the privilege of a lifetime to lead the warriors of the Department of Defense, under the leadership of our Commander in Chief Donald J. Trump. We will put America First, and we will never back down.\" Hegseth, a former\"Fox and Friends\" television anchor, was nominated by Trump in November to lead the Defense Department. In the time since his nomination was announced, Hegseth has beenscrutinized for a number of accusationsmade against him, including those of sexual assault and financial mismanagement of two different veterans organizations. Hegseth has fiercely deniedthe allegations. He appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee for a public hearing earlier this month, where he asserted to the panel that he was a \"changed man.\" \"I am not a perfect person, but redemption is real,\" he told the panel. Speaking to reporters while on a visit to Los Angeles, Trump said he was \"very happy\" with the vote, and said he was not aware of McConnell's vote. In a statement released while the vote was still going on, McConnell said that Hegseth's desire to be a \"change agent\" was not enough to qualify him for the role of secretary of defense. \"Effective management of nearly 3 million military and civilian personnel, an annual budget of nearly $1 trillion, and alliances and partnerships around the world is a daily test with staggering consequences for the security of the American people and our global interests,\" McConnell said in the statement. \"Mr. Hegseth has failed, as yet, to demonstrate that he will pass this test. But as he assumes office, the consequences of failure are as high as they have ever been.\" Hegseth was confirmed by one of the narrowest Senate margins of any defense secretary in modern history. Most defense secretaries have been confirmed with broad bipartisan votes. Lloyd Austin, former President Joe Biden's pick for defense secretary, was confirmed in a93-2 voteand Trump's first pick for defense secretary in his first term, James Mattis, was confirmed in a98-1 vote. Before the vote, Hegseth arrived at the Capitol with his wife and children to watch the proceedings in person, a rare move for a Cabinet nominee. With the Senate's vote Friday, Hegseth becomes the third member of Trump's team to be confirmed by the Senate, following Marco Rubio as secretary of state and John Ratcliffe, as CIA director. During the same hearing, he affirmed his promise to restore the \"warfighting ethos\" of the DOD, touting his experience in the National Guard. It was enough to win over the support of most Republicans in the Senate, including several of those who were initially skeptical. \"He articulated a clear vision of the Pentagon, and it was clear to anyone who listened that he is going to bring energy and fresh ideas to shake up the department's stagnant bureaucracy,\" Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a floor speech endorsing Hegseth on Thursday. \"He will restore a warfighting ethos and relentlessly focused on the military's core mission: to deter conflict and, if necessary, to win a war.\" The Senate Armed Services Committee advanced his nomination on a party-line vote on Monday. Then, in a closely watched moment on Thursday, Hegseth's nomination passed a key test vote that set the table for Friday's vote of final passage. The nomination only required a simple majority in the Senate to advance, and it cleared the threshold narrowly, with only GOP backing. Collins and Murkowski also voted no on that occasion. In a statement, Murkowski explained that she could not support Hegseth due to concerns about this character and lack of experience. \"I believe that character is the defining trait required of the Secretary of Defense and must be prioritized without compromise,\" Murkowski said in the post. \"The leader of the Department of Defense must demonstrate and model the standards of behavior and character we expect of all servicemembers, and Mr. Hegseth's nomination to the role poses significant concerns that I cannot overlook.\" Collins took issue with comments Hegseth made in the past about his belief that women should not serve in combat roles in the military. Though Hegseth has since changed his tune on that, Collins said she was unconvinced. \"I am also concerned about multiple statements, including some in the months just before he was nominated, that Mr. Hegseth has made about women serving in the military,\" Collins said. \"He and I had a candid conversation in December about his past statements and apparently evolving views. I am not convinced that his position on women serving in combat roles has changed.\" Trump expressed confidence in Hegseth ahead of the vote on Friday, though he added, \"You'll never know what's going to happen.\" McConnell, the former GOP leader, and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, ultimately cast votes in favor of advancing Hegseth's nomination in the earlier test vote, although the presidentquestioned whether McConnell will vote noon Hegseth Friday morning. Tillis said he was still considering the most recent slate of allegations against Hegseth, leveled in an affidavit from his former sister-in-law Danielle Hegseth. In that affidavit,which ABC News obtained, Danielle Hegseth attested that Pete Hegseth's ex-wife Samantha told her she \"once hid in her closet from him because she feared for her personal safety\" in the home they shared during their marriage. It also detailed episodes of binge drinking by Pete Hegseth. An attorney for Pete Hegseth denied these allegations, and the claims of abuse were also rejected by his ex-wife. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(AP Photo/Erin Hooley, file)     CHICAGO (AP) — Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove visited Chicago on Sunday to witness the start of ramped-upimmigration enforcementin the nation’s third-largest citypromised by the Trump administration, though few details of the operation were made public. Bove said he was in Chicago on Sunday morning and observed Department of Homeland Security agents, along with assisting federal agencies — including the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives. He didn’t say where the operations took place in the city or detail any arrests. “We will support everyone at the federal, state, and local levels who joins this critical mission to take back our communities,” Bove said in a statement. “We will use all available tools to address obstruction and other unlawful impediments to our efforts to protect the homeland. Most importantly, we will not rest until the work is done.” U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Jeff Carter said the agency “began conducting enhanced targeted operations” Sunday in Chicago but declined other details, citing an ongoing operation. Spokesmen for the FBI, ATF and the Drug Enforcement Administration confirmed their involvement but didn’t give other information. Chicago residents, especially in immigrant circles,have already been on edgefor months in anticipation of large-scale arrests touted by the Trump administration. The atmosphere has been especially tense the past week as top Trump officialsvowedto start immigration enforcement operations in Chicago the day after Trump’sinaugurationbefore walking back those statements.  Immigrant rights groups havetried to preparewith campaigns for immigrants to know their rights in case of an arrest. City officials have done the same, publishing similar information at public bus and train stations. On Friday, Chicago Public Schools officialsmistakenly believedICE agents had come to a city elementary school and put out statements to that effect before learning the agents were from the Secret Service. Word of immigration agents at a school — which have long been off limits to immigration agents untilTrump ended the policylast week — drew swift criticism from community groups and Gov. JB Pritzker. The Democratic governor, a frequent Trump critic, questioned the aggressive approach of the operations and the chilling effect for others, particularly for law-abiding immigrants who have been in the country for years. “We need to get rid of the violent criminals. But we also need to protect people, at least the residents of Illinois and all across the nation, who are just doing what we hope that immigrants will do,” Pritzker said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Chicago has been one of Trump’s favorite targets. The city has some of the strongest sanctuary protections, which bar cooperation between city police and immigration agents. On Saturday, several Chicago-based immigrant rights groups filed a lawsuit against ICE, seeking an injunction prohibiting certain types of immigration raids in Chicago. “Immigrant communities who have called Chicago their home for decades are scared,” said Antonio Gutierrez from Organized Communities Against Deportation, one of the plaintiffs. “We refuse to live in fear and will fight any attempts to roll back the work we’ve done to keep families together.” Durkin Richer reported from Washington.

Bridgestone said the closure will help the company “optimize its business footprint” and “strengthen its competitiveness.” In addition, Bridgestone announced capacity and workforce reductions at its Des Moines, Iowa, agriculture tire plant and additional workforce reductions in U.S. corporate, sales and operations. In Latin America, it plans reductions in workforce and production capacity in Argentina and Brazil. “Reductions in force are impacting our corporate, sales and operations in the Americas where a realignment of staffing levels is needed in response to the challenging economic environment,” company spokesperson Emily Weaver said in an email. “Of our nearly 44,000 teammates across North America and Latin America, just under 4% of our teammates are leaving the company as part of the voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions.” The LaVergne plant was the first tire-producing facility in North America for the Bridgestone Corporation. The company stopped making tires for cars and light trucks at the plant in 2009, laying off roughly half of the workers at the time. LaVergne's United Steelworkers master union workers have preferential hiring rights at the company's plants in Des Moines; Akron, Ohio; and Russellville, Arkansas, Weaver said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)         WASHINGTON (AP) — Two months ago, in his first network television interview after the election,Donald Trumpsaid he owed his victory to Americans’ anger over immigration and inflation, specifically the rising cost of groceries. “When you buy apples, when you buy bacon, when you buy eggs, they would double and triple the price over a short period of time,” he told NBC’s “Meet the Press. “And I won an election based on that. We’re going to bring those prices way down.” But in Trump’s first week back in the White House, there was little in his initial blitz ofexecutive ordersthat directly tackled those prices, besides directing federal agencies to start“pursuing appropriate actions.”He is taking steps to lower energy costs, something that Trump hopes will have ripple effects throughout the economy. Otherwise, his focus has been clamping down on immigration, which he described as his “No. 1 issue” shortly after taking the oath of office. “They all said inflation was the No. 1 issue. I said, ‘I disagree,’” Trump said. “I talked about inflation too, but how many times can you say that an apple has doubled in cost?” Trump is banking on voters giving him a pass andcontinuing to blame former President Joe Bidenfor high prices. The Republican’s comments reflect the reality that presidents have almost no levers to reduce inflation quickly without causing collateral damage to other parts of the economy.  There is more that Trump can do on energy. He is pushing to reduce regulations andincrease the amount of landavailable for drilling. He is trying to persuade domestic and foreign oil producers to potentially sacrifice their own profitsby pumping more. During a rally Saturday in Las Vegas, Trump went after his Democratic predecessor for allowing prices to rise under his watch, and promised to take care of the problem quickly. “When I think of Biden, I think of incompetence and inflation,” Trump said. Inflation peaked at a 9.1% annual rate in June 2022 during worldwide supply chain problems after the economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. Overall consumer prices have fallen since then, but have ticked up in recent months, from 2.4% in September to 2.9% in December, the latest figures available. Economists have warned that Trump’s plans for tariffs and tax cuts could create new inflationary pressures and keep interest rates elevated. Vice President JD Vance, in an interview with CBS’ “Face the Nation” airing Sunday, defended the White House’s work so far. “Prices are going to come down, but it’s going to take a little bit of time, right?” he said. He added, “Rome wasn’t built in a day.” Trump’s relative shift away from addressing costs could create an opening for Democrats to say he is not helping working-class voters, hoping that argument could offer the party a path back to power in Washington. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said Trump preferred to distract people from inflation with talk of adding Greenland to the United States or seizing the Panama Canal. “It’s catnip and it causes everybody to stop paying attention to their actual economic agenda, which has nothing to do with lowering costs and everything to do with rigging the economy to help the Mar-a-Lago crowd,” he said. During an interview on Fox News this past week, host Sean Hannity struggled to get Trump to focus on the economy. “Let me get to the economy,” Hannity said at one point. “I’m running out of time.” “The economy is going to do great,” Trump insisted. When Trump did talk about inflation in the interview, he noted how low it was during his first term and insisted prices would not have jumped up if he had president after the 2020 election, even though higher inflation was a global trend coming out of the pandemic. It is not clear how Trump would persuade oil companies and foreign countries to quickly increase production, possibly costing them profits. The Energy Information Administration reported that domestic oil production has grown at an annual rate of roughly 8.4% over the past two years to an average of nearly 13.5 million barrels a day in October. Some Trump aides suggest that could increase by an additional 3 million barrels a day. It would be difficult to achieve that much additional production in a single year without serious changes to the global market. The International Energy Agency estimates that the oil supplied to the entire world will increase by 1.8 million barrels per day to 104.7 million barrels a day. He also has expressed opposition to climate-friendlier wind and solar energy, putting more pressure on the U.S. economy to rely on fossil fuels. EJ Antoni, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, said the potential increase in energy production under Trump would ultimately flow through the economy in the form of lower prices. “If you’re going to bring down the cost of energy, you’re going to bring down the cost of all kinds of goods and services,” he said. But there is a risk that some of Trump’s plans taken as a whole could raise — not reduce — prices. Deporting migrants who are in the United States illegally could deprive companies of lower wage workers. The cost of tariffs, which are taxes placed on foreign imports, could be passed on to consumers. Trump said that his strategy also might ultimately involvepublicly pressuring the Federal Reserveto cut interest rates, saying in Davos that he would “demand” lower rates from central banks. The Fed sees its political independence as key for making tough choices to stabilize prices. Biden saw the independence as worth protecting, whereas Trump sees it as problematic. The Fed raised its benchmark rates starting in 2022 to make it more expensive to borrow and succeeded enough in reducing inflationary pressures that it could trim rates late last year. Trump believes that greater oil production will put him in a position to tell the Fed what to do. Asked in the Oval Office if he expects the Fed to listen to him, Trump simply said, “Yeah.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(Andrew Esola via AP)             ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — North America’s tallest peak is a focal point of Jeff King’s life. The four-time winner of the 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometer) Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race operates his kennel and mushing tourism business just 8 miles (12.87 kilometers) fromDenali National Park and Preserve’s entrance, and the 20,310-foot (6,190-meter) mountain looms large as he trains his dogs on nearby trails. King and many others who live in the mountain’s shadow say most Alaskans will never stop calling the peak Denali,its Alaska Native name, despitePresident Donald Trump’s executive orderthat the namerevert to Mount McKinley-- an identifier inspired byPresident William McKinley, who was from Ohio and never set foot in Alaska. For many who live near Denali, Trump’s suggestion was peculiar. “I don’t know a single person that likes the idea, and we’re pretty vocal about it,” King said. “Denali respects the Indigenous people that have been here and around Denali for tens of thousands of years.” The mountain was named after McKinleywhen a prospector walked out of the Alaska wildernessin 1896, and the first news he heard was that the Republican had been nominated for president. The name was quickly challenged, but maps had already been circulated with the mountain’s name in place. At the time, there was no recognition of the name Denali, or “the high one,” bestowed on the mountain in interior Alaska by Athabascan tribal members, who have lived in the region for centuries.  The McKinley name stuck until 2015, whenPresident Barack Obama’s administrationchanged it to Denali as a symbolic gesture to Alaska Natives on the eve of his Alaska visit tohighlight climate change. Trump said he issued the order to “restore the name of a great president, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs. President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent.” The area lies solely in the United States, and Trump, as president, has the authority to change federal geographical names within the country. In Ohio, Trump’s move drew praise. “I was really excited to see President Trump do that executive order,” former U.S. Rep. Bob Gibbs, R-Ohio, told The Associated Press by telephone Thursday. McKinley “was a great president,” Gibbs said. “It was the appropriate thing to do.” That’s not how Alaskans see it. Trump injected “a jarring note” into Alaska affairs, Steve Haycox, professor emeritus of history at the University of Alaska Anchorage, wrote inthe Anchorage Daily News. “Historical analysis confirms that William McKinley is the wrong public figure for Alaskans to commemorate,” he said. McKinley served as president from 1897 until he was assassinated in 1901. He was an imperial colonialist who oversaw the expansion of the American empire with the occupation of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Philippines andHawaii, pushed by business interests and Christian missionaries wanting to convert Indigenous peoples, Haycox said. “Trump’s push to rescind the name Denali for the colonialist and white elitist McKinley is insulting to all Alaskans, especially to Alaska’s Native people, and should be soundly rejected,” Haycox said. John Wayne Howe, who unsuccessfully ran for U.S. House last year representing the Alaskan Independence Party, which holds that Alaskans should be allowed to vote on becoming an independent nation, said he is tired of “people changing the names of stuff, period.” He also is not in favor of naming anything after people because “the persons that we consider absolutely perfect change over time, and it just leads to confusion.” Howe said he prefers Denali because he knows McKinley’s history and it’s the name most preferred by Alaskans. This past week, two resolutions were introduced in the Alaska Legislature to keep the name Denali. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Trump ally who praised another order by the president aimed at spurring resource development in the state, said he had not had a chance to speak with Trump about the issue but hoped to have a conversation next month in Washington about what Denali means to Alaskans, Americans and “our Native folks.” But Sarah Palin, a former Republican governor who is also a Trump supporter, said the McKinley name should never have been removed. Palin’s Secret Service code name was Denali in 2008 when she was GOP presidential nominee John McCain’s running mate the year they lost to Obama and Joe Biden. But in an interview with Al Arabiya News this past week, Palin said she didn’t see why the mountain’s name needed to be changed to begin with. “It’s always been Mount McKinley,” said Palin, who didn’t respond to a message from The Associated Press. “Nobody was begging for a change in name in that peak. Just put it back the way it was, more common sense.” Alaska’s U.S. senators, Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, have supported the name Denali. U.S. Rep. Nick Begich, a first-term Republican, sidestepped the debate. “I’m focused on job creation, opportunities in Alaska,” Begich told Politico. “And what we call a mountain in Alaska is of little concern to me.” The Alaska Native Heritage Center, the statewide Indigenous cultural center in Anchorage, supports preserving Indigenous place names. “Restoring and honoring them acknowledges the deep, millennia-old connection Indigenous peoples maintain with these lands and is a step toward respect and reconciliation,” the center’s president, Emily Edenshaw, said in a statement. The quirky Alaska community of Talkeetna, about 140 miles (225.3 kilometers) south of the park and wherea cat was once mayor, is the jumping off point for climbers before making the ascent of the peak. The historic community long rumored to be the inspiration for the 1990s television series “Northern Exposure” is also a popular tourist stop. Joe McAneney of Talkeetna worked as a summer raft-guide for two years before moving to Alaska full time in 2012. He’s now a pilot for an air taxi company, ferrying climbers and tourists to the mountain in a small airplane outfitted with skis to land atbase camp, located on Kahiltna Glacierat 7,200 feet (2,194.6 meters) above sea level. He knows once tourist season comes around, he will have to answer their questions of what he thinks about Trump changing the name. He knows what his answer will be. “It’s always been Denali, and it always will be,” he said. The executive order can instigate the name change, but compliance is another issue. “The only people that are going to adhere to that are probably the people that would have been still calling it McKinley anyway,” McAneney said There is a long-standing Alaska trait of ignoring what the rest of the world thinks, and it’s usually expressed like this: “We don’t care how they do it Outside.” Outside, which is always capitalized, refers to every place that is not Alaska. “I think unofficially and officially in Alaska, it’ll always be Denali,” McAneney said. “I don’t think the president can change that.” For King, the decorated Iditarod musher and fan favorite, Trump’s decision had a whiff of arrogance. “I’m surprised he doesn’t want to name it Trump Mountain,” he said.

In December, it announced a consultation into how copyright law can “enable creators and right holders to exercise control over, and seek remuneration for, the use of their works for AI training” while also ensuring “AI developers have easy access to a broad range of high-quality creative content.” Publishers, artists’ organizations and media companies, including The Associated Press, have banded together as the Creative Rights in AI Coalition to oppose weakening copyright protections. “We’re the people, you’re the government. You’re supposed to protect us. That’s your job,” McCartney said. “So you know, if you’re putting through a bill, make sure you protect the creative thinkers, the creative artists, or you’re not going to have them.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "content": "The 17-year-old allegedly shot two classmates at his Nashville school this week. A teenager who opened fire with a 9 mm pistolin his Nashville high school cafeteriafired a total of 10 shots within 17 seconds of entering the room, according to police. Solomon Henderson, 17, had gone into a bathroom and posted photos to social media just before he went to the cafeteria and opened fire, police said. Henderson shot and killed 16-year-old Josselin Corea Escalante and shot and wounded a 17-year-old boy at Antioch High School around 11 a.m. Wednesday, according to police. Henderson died in the cafeteria from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, police said. The injured boy suffered a graze wound and was treated and released, police said. Authorities are still investigating how Henderson obtained the pistol, Nashville police said Thursday. The gun was purchased in Arizona in 2022 and was not reported stolen, police said. No firearms or firearm parts were found during Wednesday's search of Henderson's home, according to authorities. Authorities are now scouring Henderson's writings and social media presence as they investigate his ideological influences. A Pinterest account linked to Henderson features photos of past school shooters, including the shooters from Parkland, Florida, and Uvalde, Texas, a source told ABC News. Henderson's social media presence also shows he may have been in contact with 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow, whocarried out a shooting at the Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin,last month, according to law enforcement sources. Rupnow, who went by Samantha, also died after the shooting, in which two were killed and several wounded. Rupnow's account may have been following Henderson's account at the time of the Wisconsin shooting in December, according to law enforcement sources. It appears Henderson had two documents on \"non-traditional websites, one 51 pages in length, the other 288 pages,\" police said. The 51-page document expressed violent white supremacist beliefs, sources told ABC News. He expressed self-hatred as a Black person, and he wrote of wishing violence on other Black people. He also expressed violent hatred toward Jews and used antisemitic tropes and conspiracy theories to express his views, according to the sources. Henderson appeared to support neo-Nazi accelerationist and violent incel beliefs and expressed a desire to see genocide committed against racial and religious minorities, according to sources. He belonged to online communities that promote violence and extremism, sources said, and some people in those groups publicly identified Henderson as the school shooter long before his identity was confirmed by authorities.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)                              FRESNO, Texas (AP) — The only moment TiAnna Yeldell has to herself is when she’s sleeping, and that doesn’t happen much. The 44-year-old single mom of three works 80-hour weeks to provide for her children, ages 8, 14, and 18. During the day, she is a driver for Pizza Hut, where she earns $9.50 an hour before tips. At night, she cleans trains for Houston’s Metro system, where she earns about $17 an hour. The times that she pulls both shifts, Yeldell sleeps for just two to three hours before getting her kids up and ready for school. Then she does it all over again. Yeldell is among the millions of fast food workers across the U.S. scraping to get by. Abouttwo-thirdsof them are women, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and many are supporting their families on minimum wages set at the federal government’s floor of $7.25 an hour. Fast food workers are disproportionately Hispanic, making up 24.6% of the industry’s workforce compared with 18.8% of the overall workforce. And more than half of all U.S. fast food workers are 20 or older, “contrary to the myth of it being a teenage job that they just do for pocket money,” said Tsedeye Gebreselassie, an attorney for nonprofit advocacy organization National Employment Law Project. TiAnna Yeldell, a 44-year-old single mom of three, prepares to make a delivery for Pizza Hut, Thursday, Nov. 14, 2024, in Missouri City, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)  President Donald Trump, whomanned the fry station at a McDonald’sin Pennsylvania while on the campaign trail last year, has acknowledged that the federal minimum wage is “very low” and that he would consider raising it, but that doing so would be “complicated.” Meanwhile, a growing number of states have pushed to increase their minimum wage in the face of record-high inflation in recent years. Voters in Alaska approved a ballot initiative in November that will raise the state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour from $11.73 an hour by 2027. Missouri voters likewise approved a minimum wage hike to $15 from $12.30 an hour by 2026. And California — which has one of the highest costs of living in the country — in Aprilraised wagesfor fast food workers specifically, to $20 an hour from $16 an hour.  By the end of this year, 23 states and 65 cities and counties will raise their minimum wage floors, according to a December 2024 National Employment Law Projectreportthat combed through legislation across the country.  But not Texas, where Yeldell and her family live. It isone of 20 statesat the $7.25 federal minimum wage floor and that rate hasn’t budged since 2009. Democratic lawmakers in Texas have repeatedly proposed legislation to raise the minimum wage in the state to no avail.Preemption laws, which exist in Texas and many other states, block cities and counties from adopting their own minimum wage laws, presenting another barrier. Today, a living wage for one adult raising three children in the Houston metro area is $57.65 an hour, according to MIT’s Living Wage Calculator. For Yeldell, it’s not possible to get by on her fast food job alone, which is why she must work a second job. Still wearing her visor and gray “No One Out Pizzas The Hut” shirt, she slumps sideways after a recent work shift, resting an elbow on the folding table surrounded by four folding chairs where the family eats. The living room furniture is sparse but the home is tidy. A yellow mop bucket sits near the entryway, and a small vacuum rests against the closet door. She only takes a moment to rest before changing into Looney Tunes sweatpants and a yellow T-shirt, scooping fajitas onto plates for the kids’ dinner, and packing up the leftovers. Then the teens disappear into their bedrooms, and her Minecraft pajama-clad youngest curls up next to her on the couch, playing a game on a bright red console. TiAnna Yeldell, left, spends time with her son Ivan, 8, right, at her home, Thursday, Nov. 14, 2024, in Missouri City, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)  “I don’t want to work two jobs -- I’m really tired. But I have to, because the jobs don’t pay enough,” Yeldell said. “I would not be able to provide a roof over my kids’ head … They come first, I come second.” The Associated Press reached out to Pizza Hut, as well as its parent company, Yum Brands, for comment on wages for fast food workers but did not hear back. Wages are just one of many issues fast food workers face. Unpredictable hours, limited access to paid sick leave, and challenging customer interactions all shape their experiences, said Daniel Schneider, co-director and co-founder of the Shift Project, a joint Harvard and University of California, San Francisco project researching the conditions of service sector work. Wage theft and other law violations are also common in the industry, added labor scholar David Madland, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. “The fast food industry is notorious for low pay and poor working conditions,” Madland said. “It’s seen as the almost the sort of typical throwaway job that policy has cared very little about.” Yeldell’s Pizza Hut deliveries sometimes go until 11 p.m. She carries a knife in her pocket, as well as a flashlight, to keep her safe.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)  TiAnna Yeldell works in the kitchen at Pizza Hut, Thursday, Nov. 14, 2024, in Missouri City, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)  Despite the challenges, Yeldell maintains a positive outlook about her job, which she started about a year and a half ago as a delivery driver and has since learned to do “pretty much everything” at her Fresno, Texas store, including making pizzas, prepping ingredients, and running the register. “Pizza Hut is a really easy job and the job is only hard if you make it hard,” she said. “And I’m a fast learner, so it doesn’t bother me. The only time that it’s worrisome is when we’re slow and they say, ‘Oh, we got to cut your hours.’” Contrast Texas to California, which now has the highest fast food minimum wage of any state since lawmakers passed a minimum $20 hourly wage for those workers. Angelica Hernandez, 51, who has worked at various McDonald’s restaurants for 20 years and now works for a Monterey Park location in Los Angeles County, said the raise helped her pay rent and bills on time, avoid late fees, and buy “a bit more” at the grocery store. It’s also allowed her family the chance to go out to eat on the weekends, “which I was never able to do before, so it’s a big accomplishment what fast food workers were able to win,” she said. But Hernandez says much of the increase was swallowed by a recent $200 rent hike. “We need a little more to be able to save money and buy clothes without being tight every two weeks or have to use credit,” she said. Now, Hernandez is a member of California Fast Food Workers Union, and councilmember on the state’s Fast Food Council established bythe new California lawand aimed at improving working conditions.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)  Critics ofthe lawsay continuing to increase minimum wage is not the answer, arguing that it has raised prices and reduced job opportunities for young people, pinching franchisees in an industry with already-slim margins. “When you see a spike in operating costs pretty dramatically in a short period of time, it creates challenges,” said Jot Condie, president and CEO of the California Restaurant Association, which opposed the law. He added that franchisees, who are essentially small business owners, are most harmed. But a September report from University of California, Berkeley’s Institute for Research on Labor and Employment called the effects of the new law “benign,” and found that the policy did not affect employment adversely and increased prices about 3.7%, or about 15 cents on a $4 hamburger. For Yeldell, increasing the minimum wage in Texas “would be more fair.” ”If other states could change, y’all can change too,” she said. Her exhaustion shines through: her movements are slow, and her eyelids droop. Between her two jobs, she has no days off so her activities with the kids have to happen on the days she works at one job, not both. But she makes it happen. On a chilly Friday morning at 7 a.m., she walks her youngest to the bus stop, then drives her daughter across town to have her senior pictures done before her Pizza Hut shift starts.

Both women’s hair is arranged in long, elegant braids with the ends curled. “Being a mother, I do what I’m supposed to do for my kids,” she said. But for all her hard work, Yeldell says the family has little to no savings. On good months, she says she has about $100 left over. Often, she has nothing, which leaves no room for vacations, or outings with kids. “At the end of the day, I’ve worked all these hours and I really have nothing to show for it, but just paying some bills,” she said.

Burroughs.  Country music comes naturally to Ringo Starr. The former Beatle has dabbled in the music ever since singing the country hit “Act Naturally” with the Beatles in 1965, and he’s now about to release a whole country album. Starr says in an interview with The Associated Press’ Andrew Dalton that he’s put a bit of country in most everything he’s done, so the album wasn’t too big a stretch. Starr says the project began when he bumped into his friend, classic country aficionado T-Bone Burnett, and asked him to write a song. Burnett came back with nine. The resulting album, “Look Up,” comes out in January.  Erykah Badu has been a music disruptor, culture shifter and style maven ever since she stepping into the limelight with her 1997 debut album, “Baduizm.” The four-time Grammy winner, who was recently honored with the CFDA (Council of Fashion Designers of America) Icon award, sat down with AP entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton to talk about her fashion influence, working on new music, her appearance in “The Piano Lesson” —and finally learning to stop and smell the flowers.

Rama Rao Jr. is following up the international success of “RRR” with the action-drama “Devara: Part 1,” in which he plays both a mythical hero and a son struggling with his dad’s legacy.

The 41-year-old, whose father and grandfather were both prominent actors and political leaders, sat down with AP entertainment editor Ryan Pearson to talk about his own perspective on fatherhood, filming crowd-pleasing underwater scenes, staying “innocent” as an actor — and his love for the Will Smith film “The Pursuit of Happiness.”  RZA’s hoarding habit led to his newest adventure in music: a ballet and surprisingly traditional classical music album he calls “A Ballet Through Mud.” He sat down with AP entertainment editor Ryan Pearson to talk about the nostalgic genesis of the project, the growing bridge between the worlds of classical and hip-hop, and his hopes for what happens next with his composition and ballet.  After releasing 18 albums over more than two decades, Xiu Xiu is still making music for outsiders. With the release of “13'’ Frank Beltrame Italian Stiletto with Bison Horn Grips,” band leader Jamie Stewart spoke with AP entertainment journalist Krysta Fauria about balancing harmony and dissonance, moving to Berlin — and why the band “wouldn’t exist” without David Lynch’s “Twin Peaks” universe.

She sat down with AP entertainment journalist Kaitlyn Huamani to talk about learning to trust again in Hollywood, working with Ryan Murphy and Dustin Hoffman — and the value of storytelling.  Six years after “A Star is Born,” Lady Gaga returns to the Venice Film Festival with “Joker: Folie à Deux” alongside Joaquin Phoenix and director Todd Phillips. She sat down with AP film writer Lindsey Bahr to talk about creating a new voice for her Lee/Harley Quinn character, writing a “waltz that falls apart” for the film — and why it’s an “exciting time” in pop music. Phillips shares why he chose her for the role, singing on set — and using the film to pose the question: “What is entertainment?”  Angelina Jolie portrays renowned opera singer Maria Callas in Pablo Larraín’s “Maria,” focusing on her life in Paris in the 70s before her death at age 53. They sat down with AP entertainment editor Louise Dixon at the Venice Film Festival to discuss how Jolie connected with Callas, the difficulty of performing opera — and why the film, to be released on Netflix, is the most personal of Larraín’s biopic trilogy that includes “Spencer” and “Jackie.”  Nearly a decade after his last full-length release, Zedd is releasing “Telos.” The Grammy-winning producer/DJ says he needed to push himself to make an album that would move the needle — one that told a story beyond the success of his debut LP, “Clarity,” or “True Colors.” The German dance-pop maverick says the album — which features collaborators ranging from Muse and John Mayer to Remi Wolf and Bea Miller — is “an album that for many years I doubted I could create.” He spoke with AP entertainment journalist Rick Taber about the long process of creating “Telos,” being inspired by Jeff Buckley and the state of EDM.  “Only Murders in the Building” has become a “safe place” for Selena Gomez as the hit Hulu comedy enters its fourth season.

The reality competition series’ stars Johnny “Bananas” Devenanzio, Aneea Ferreira and Nurys Mateo — along with host TJ Lavin — sat down with AP entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton to talk about the 40th season, which features 40 returning competitors in a “Battle of the Eras.”  Michael Keaton says it would have been a “huge mistake” for his titular trickster ghost character to get significantly more screen time in “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” than he did in the first film. The 72-year-old star sat down with AP entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton to talk about why he was nervous to return for the sequel featuring Jenna Ortega and Winona Ryder, the impact of Tim Burton’s original 1988 horror comedy — and why he never thought of himself as playing Batman.  Justin Baldoni’s “It Ends With Us” journey began well before Colleen Hoover’s novel became a sensation on TikTok. The 40-year-old actor and filmmaker optioned the book in 2019 while he was shooting “Jane The Virgin” and preparing to release his feature film directorial debut, “Five Feet Apart.” Five years later, he spoke with AP entertainment journalist Alicia Rancilio about directing and co-starring alongside Blake Lively in the drama that revolves around domestic violence.

The 36-year-old South African musician has been steadily stripping back his mask since his 2019 debut album “Pony.” Peck spoke with AP music journalist Maria Sherman about his growing confidence, his high-profile collaborations and country radio.  Josh Hartnett is looking back at shedding his Hollywood heartthrob image in the 2000s as he stars in M. Night Shyamalan’s thriller “Trap.” Hartnett is now 46 and lives in England with his wife and four children. While he’s been working steadily since breaking out in 1998 with a “Halloween” sequel and “The Faculty,” he intentionally moved away from studio movies and leading man roles after being typecast as his fame grew with movies like “Black Hawk Down” and “Pearl Harbor.” In “Trap,” Hartnett plays a father with a secret who takes his daughter to a pop concert — which is surrounded by police searching for a serial killer.  M. Night Shyamalan has been at least partly self-financing his films since 2015’s “The Visit,” risking his own money on box office success. His latest is “Trap,” starring Josh Hartnett as a father with a secret and Shyamalan’s daughter Saleka as a pop star whose concert is surrounded by police looking to capture a serial killer. Shyamalan spoke with AP entertainment editor Ryan Pearson about his high-risk, high-reward, lower-budget filmmaking approach, guiding his daughters’ artistic pursuits — and his philosophy that “talent is process.”  Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

        "content": "Conversations about removing these watchdogs began during Trump's transition. In a late-night Friday move, President Donald Trump fired at least 17 independent watchdogs -- known as inspectors general -- at multiple federal agencies, sources familiar with the move told ABC News. The conversations about ousting these government watchdogsbegan during Trump's transitionback to the White House. While inspectors general can be fired by the president — it can only happen after communicating with Congress 30 days in advance and in 2022 Congress strengthened the law requiring administrations to give a detailed reasoning for the firing of an IG. There isn't yet have a complete list of all the IG's impacted, but at least one high-profile watchdog — Justice Department IG Michael Horowitz — did not receive notice that he was fired as of yesterday evening. Horowitz is an Obama appointee and has issued reports that have been critical of both the Trump and Biden administrations. The current law also mandates that any acting IG's must come from within the IG community, though it's unclear whether the Trump White House believes they need to follow that aspect of the law. The inspectors general were blindsided by emails they received Friday night from Sergio Gor, the director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, according to a source with knowledge of the firings. \"I am writing to inform you that due to changing priorities your position ... is terminated, effective immediately,\" read the emails reviewed by ABC News. Many of the IGs had met with Trump transition officials at their agencies and had productive conversations with the incoming administration, the source said. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Saturday that Congress was not given the required 30-day notice. While talking to reporters aboard Air Force One Saturday evening on his way from Las Vegas to Miami, Trump classified the firings as a \"common thing to do.\" \"Well, I did it because it's a very common thing to do – not all of them. Like Horowitz, we're keeping.\" He continued, \"It's a very standard thing to do, very much like the U.S. attorneys.\" \"There may be good reason the IGs were fired. We need to know that if so. I'd like further explanation from President Trump,\" Grassley said in a statement given to ABC News. \"Regardless, the 30 day detailed notice of removal that the law demands was not provided to Congress.\" Grassley told ABC News earlier this week that the president must tell Congress before removal. \"First of all to remind that our Inspector General can't be removed from office until the president, and that's any president, not just Trump. So this is a message to all these presidents you've got to tell Congress a month ahead of time the reasons for removing them,\" Grassley said. He added, \"And the other thing is that inspector generals are expected to be independent of political pressure, independent of the head of the agency, and to make sure that the law is enforced and money spent appropriately, and there shouldn't be any political pressure against any of his work.\" In a letter to the White House Friday, Mike Ware, the Small Business Administration inspector general and chair of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, said the firing of the independent watchdogs over email is not \"legally sufficient to dismiss Presidentially Appointed, Senate confirmed Inspectors General.\" The letter, obtained by ABC News, goes on to explain the removal process codified in the 2022 amendments to the inspectors general law. \"The requirement to provide the substantive rationale, including detailed and case specific reasons, was added to better enable Congress to engage on and respond to a proposed removal of an Inspector General in order to protect the independence of Inspectors General,\" Ware wrote. In floor remarks Saturday morning, Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer ripped into the Trump administration for the move, saying that the dismissals are a possible violation of federal law. \"These firings are Donald Trump's way of telling us he is terrified of accountability and is hostile to facts and to transparency,\" Schumer said. Republican Sen. Joni Ernst launched abipartisan IG caucusjust ten days ago. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the newly-minted group, told ABC News he'll be looking to his Republican colleagues on that panel to take some sort of action. \"We have a group, and it is bipartisan, that is supportive of inspectors general, and I think it is a real test of whether they are willing to let loose an unchecked surge of corruption and waste,\" he said. Reaction among Republican senators was mixed. Texas Sen. John Cornyn deferred to Grassley when asked for comment. \"I think we just take it one step at a time and try to understand what the rationale was,\" he said. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky, said he believes many of the inspectors general do need to be replaced and that Trump ultimately has the power to do so. But he noted there may be a process that needs to be followed. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who helped to pass the legislation in 2022 that strengthened the law requiring administrations to give a detailed reasoning for the firing of an IG, said she was frustrated by Trump's move. \"I don't understand why one would fire individuals whose mission is to root out waste, fraud and abuse,\" Collins said. \"So this leaves a gap in what I know is a priority for President Trump, so I don't understand it.\" Some Republican senators who have been staunch supporters of Trump, however, praised the firings. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said he's \"all for it\" when asked about Trump's move to dismiss the inspectors general. \"We need to clean house. I mean, if they're not for this country to move on down the road,\" he said. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., however, said the firing of the IG's was \"one more example of the lack of respect for the rule of law.\" \"He seems to be trying to throw a monkey wrench into the kind of any independence left in our government,\" Warner said of Trump. \"The whole idea of inspector generals is to have that independent check. Who is going to take those jobs going forward?\" Later Saturday, the ranking Democrats on the House committees sent a letter to Trump strongly condemning the firing of several inspectors general. \"Your actions violate the law, attack our democracy, and undermine the safety of the American people,\" the group wrote. \"Firing inspectors general without due cause is antithetical to good government, undermines the proper stewardship of taxpayer dollars, and degrades the federal government's ability to function effectively and efficiently,\" they added.

        "content": "Officials say they have recaptured the final four monkeys who escaped two months ago from a South Carolina compound that breeds them for medical research YEMASSEE, S.C. --Authorities in South Carolina said Friday the last four of 43 escaped monkeys have been recaptured after two months living in the woods, weathering arare snowstormand being temped back into captivity by peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. The rhesus macaque monkeys, all females, made a break for it after police say an employee did notfully lock their enclosureat Alpha Genesis, a facility that breeds them for medical research — known to locals as “the monkey farm.” The recaptured monkeys appeared to be in good health, Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard said in a statement relayed by Yemassee Police in a social media post, without further details. While they were on the loose, the area saw its first snow in seven years, accumulating up to 3 inches (8 centimeters). The rhesus macaques made a break for it on Nov. 6, and mostly hung around near the facility. They're about the size of a cat, weighing roughly 7 pounds (3 kilograms). It appears a worker unintentionally left the gates unlocked when the monkeys escaped, Westergaard said in November. Workers were supposed to lock and latch one gate before opening another, but all three gates and latches were left unsecure. The monkeys posed no risk to public health, said Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police. Alpha Guard employees kept an eye on the monkeys and set out humane traps. Most were lured back with food and were given peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and \"monkey biscuits\" — a high-protein Purina Monkey Chow specially formulated for the rhesus macaques. The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical facilities and other researchers. Humans have beenusing the monkeys for scientific researchsince the late 1800s. Scientists believe rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25 million years ago and share about 93% of the same DNA. The compound is about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee and about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)              LAS VEGAS (AP) — PresidentDonald Trumpcame to Las Vegas on Saturday to crow about his campaign promise to eliminate taxes on tips, signaling to allies in Congress the importance of the policy but stopping well short of offering details for making the slogan a reality. Instead, Trump spent most of his 40 minutes speaking to roughly 1,000 supporters in a casino ballroom lauding his November election victory, mocking former President Joe Biden’s administration and touting his torrent of executive actions since taking office Monday. “But I have to be honest with you, I’m really here for a different reason, I’m here to say thank you,” Trump told the crowd at Circa Resort & Casino. The victory lap, Trump’s first swing-state rally since taking office, came after he won Nevada’s six electoral votes in November, becoming the first Republican since George W. Bush in 2004 to carry the state. It was part of Trump’s sweep of all seven of the most competitive states that gave him a healthy electoral majority and a second, non-consecutive term. AP correspondent Julie Walker reports President Trump leans into his pledge to eliminate taxes on tips. Aides said Trump’s stop in Nevada was to deliver an “economic-focused message” built around his familiar promise to hospitality industry workers to remove the tax on gratuity income. “We’re going to get it for you — ‘no tax on tips,’” Trump said, standing behind a podium emblazoned with the same slogan he used throughout the 2024 campaign.  After the rally, Trump strode through the Circa casino floor past its purple-hewed velvet tables, to cheers from visitors of “USA, USA.” At a roulette table, a player yelled, “Give me $47 on 47,” for Trump, now the 47th president. “Ohh,” Trump lamented at the losing throw but he signed autographs as supporters hooted. If light on detail, Trump’s comments on tips were a signal to Republicans in Congress that the proposal is a priority for the massive tax package they intend to pass this year. Trump is set to meet House Republicans on Monday as they gather in Florida to chart the strategy ahead. Speaker Mike Johnson, who is laboring to get the package moving forward, invited Trump to address a joint session of Congress on March 4, a tradition for new presidents, who don’t deliver a State of the Union address until their second year in office. Johnson said lawmakers working with Trump hope to make the next four years “some of the most consequential in our nation’s history.” Nevada is a familiar backdrop to talk tips and taxation. As a candidate, Trump first announced the idea of ending gratuity taxes during a rally in June in Las Vegas — aproposal later copiedby his Democratic opponent,Kamala Harris. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates there are 2.24 million restaurant servers across the country, with tips making up a large percentage of their income. In Las Vegas, the 24-hour economy is fueled by everyone from wait staff and valet parkers to hotel maids and casino dealers, all of whom collect tips. Nevada has the nation’s highest concentration of tipped workers, with about 25.8 waiters and waitresses alone per 1,000 jobs, followed by Hawaii and Florida. Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer for the Culinary Union, which represents about 60,000 hospitality workers across Nevada, said Trump’s plans “must not end” with scrapping taxation on tips. “Eliminating taxes on tips and ending the $2.13 sub-minimum wage — that is the reality in too many states across the country — will uplift millions of hospitality workers,” Pappageorge said. He said many employers set hourly pay well below the federal minimum wage and expect gratuities to make up the difference. Despite the stated focus on taxes, the Nevada rally served mostly as a capstone of sorts to Trump’s first week in office, as he recounted for the crowd the executive orders he’d signed and what they’ll do. “We’ve accomplished more in one week than most administrations have experienced in four years and we’re just getting started,” Trump said, adding that his executive orders “reverse the horrible failures and betrayals that we inherited from a group of people that didn’t know what the hell they were doing.” Trump cited a sweeping freeze on new money for all U.S. foreign assistance, his notice of a U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and his order ceasing diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the federal government, among other things. “We feel a light over our country,” Trump said. ”Everyone does.” Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

(Neon via AP)         NEW YORK (AP) — Critics lambasted it and audiences didn’t grade it much better. But despite the turbulence,Mel Gibson’s “Flight Risk”managed to open No. 1 at the box office with a modest $12 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. On a quiet weekend, even for the typically frigid movie-going month of January, the top spot went to the Lionsgate thriller starring Mark Wahlberg as a pilot flying an Air Marshal (Michelle Dockery) and fugitive (Topher Grace) across Alaska. But it wasn’t a particularly triumphant result for Gibson’s directorial follow-up to 2016’s“Hacksaw Ridge.”Reviews (21% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores (a “C” CinemaScore) were terrible. President Donald Trumprecentlynamed Gibson a “special ambassador”to Hollywood, along with Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone. Going into the weekend, Hollywood’s attention was more focused on theSundance Film Festivaland on Thursday’sOscar nominations, which were twice postponed by thewildfires in the Los Angeles region. The weekend was also a small test as to whether the once more common Oscar “bump” that can sometimes follow nominations still exists. Most contenders have by now completed the bulk of their theatrical runs and are more likely to see an uptick on VOD or streaming. But the weekend’s most daring gambit was A24 pushingBrady Corbet’s “The Brutalist”a three–and-a-half-hour epic nominated for 10 Academy Awards, into wide release. Though some executives initially greeted “The Brutalist,” which is running with an intermission, as “un-distributable,” Corbet has said, A24 acquired the film out of the Venice Film Festival and it’s managed solid business, collecting $6 million in limited release.  In wide release, it earned $2.9 million — a far from blockbuster sum but the best weekend yet for “The Brutalist.” The audience was downright miniscule for another best-picture nominee: RaMell Ross’“Nickel Boys.”Innovatively shot almost entirely in first-person POV, the Amazon MGM Studios release gathered just $340,171 in 540 locations after expanding by 300 theaters. Coming offone of the lowest Martin Luther King Jr. weekends in years, no new releases made a major impact. Steven Soderbergh’s “Presence,”a well-reviewed horror film shot from the perspective of a ghost inside a suburban home, debuted with $3.4 million in 1,750 locations. The film, released by Neon and acquired out of last year’s Sundance, was made for just $2 million. The top spots otherwise went to holdovers. The Walt Disney Co.’s“Mufasa: The Lion King,”in its sixth weekend of release, scored $8.7 million to hold second place. After starting slow, the Barry Jenkins-directed film has amassed $626.7 million globally. “One of Them Days,”the Keke Palmer and SZA led comedy from Sony Pictures, held well in its second weekend, dropping just 32% with $8 million in ticket sales. In recent years, few comedies have found success on the big screen, but “One of Them Days” has proven an exception. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. “Flight Risk,” $12 million. 2. “Mufasa: The Lion King,” $8.7 million. 3. “One of Them Days,” $8 million. 4. “Sonic the Hedgehog 3,” $5.5 million. 5. “Moana 2,” $4.3 million. 6. “Presence,” $3.4 million. 7. “Wolf Man,” $3.4 million. 8. “A Complete Unknown,” $3.1 million. 9. “Den of Thieves 2: Pantera,” $3 million. 10. “The Brutalist,” $2.9 million.

        "content": "Homan says administration has a “clear” message for undocumented immigrants. For the first time in U.S. history, military aircraft were used this past week to deport scores of undocumented migrants from the United States. Middle schools, Trump administration officials say, are now seen as places to target for immigration enforcement operations. And, according to President Trump's \"border czar,\" every undocumented immigrant should worry they could be arrested at any time, even if they have no criminal record. The \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, says it's all part of the Trump administration's effort to send a \"clear\" message: \"There's consequences [for] entering the country illegally,\" he told ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz on Sunday. \"If we don't show there's consequences, you're never going to fix the border problem,\" he said. More than 11 million undocumented immigrants are currently estimated to be living in the U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to take unprecedented action to remove as many of them as possible and stem the flow of more migrants coming to the southern border. In his first several days in office, Trump declared a national emergency at the border, announced an end to the so-called practice of \"catch and release\" -- when migrants claiming asylum are given court dates and then released pending those proceedings -- and sought to overturn the long-held Constitutional right of birthright citizenship, a move that immediately faced legal challenges and was at least temporarily blocked by a federal judge. As for the millions of undocumented immigrants already in the country, Homan said the administration will deport \"as many as we can,\" starting with threats to public safety threats and national security, Homan said. According to estimates released by House Republicans last year, based on government data, hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants in the country are convicted criminals or have charges pending against them. Government statistics indicate that in the past four years, hundreds of migrants were caught along the southern border with names matching known or suspected terrorists on a government watchlist. And Homan has said more than 2 million people were detected along the border but never captured, so authorities don't know who they are or what threat some of them could pose. According to statistics released by the Department of Homeland Security last year, a tiny fraction of those who reached U.S. borders in the prior three years had any kind of criminal record, and the vast majority of them involved nonviolent crimes, such as driving under the influence or previously entering the country illegally. Homan told ABC News that the Trump administration is only \"in the beginning stages\" of carrying out its mass deportation plan, making public safety threats and national security threats a \"priority,\" but \"as that aperture opens, there'll be more arrests nationwide.\" And he warned that there will be \"collateral arrests,\" especially in the so-called \"sanctuary cities\" that he says are resistant to helpingImmigrationand Customs Enforcement officials locate and arrest undocumented immigrants already in local custody for other crimes. \"Sanctuary cities lock us out of the jails,\" said Homan, who led ICE as acting director in Trump's first administration. According to Homan, that creates significant safety concerns: When an undocumented immigrant arrested for a serious crime is released by local authorities, instead of being deported, it \"endangers the community.\" Nevertheless, Homan said that's a time when ICE officers would likely make \"collateral arrests.\" \"When we find him, he's going to be with others … [and] if they're in the country illegally, they're coming too,\" he said. He emphasized that anyone in the country unlawfully is \"on the table.\" \"It's not OK to violate the laws of this country,\" he said. \"We have millions of people standing in line, taking the test, doing their background investigation, paying the fees that want to come in the right way.\" \"So if you're in the country illegally, you got a problem,\" he said. On Monday, during Trump's first day in office, acting Homeland Security Secretary Benjamine Huffman issued a directive telling immigration authorities they could conduct operations in so-called \"sensitive\" areas that he said were off-limits during the Biden administration. \"Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America's schools and churches to avoid arrest,\" he said in a statement. Others, however, said the administration was simply creating fear within the immigrant community, with the chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on Migration saying that \"turning places of care, healing and solace into places of fear and uncertainty … will note make our communities safer. He said that as they prioritize national security threats and public safety threats, ICE officers might have to even go into schools because \"many\" members of gangs tied to South and Central America, such as MS-13, are between 14 and 17 years old. In his interview with ABC News, Homan said that no other law enforcement agency is restricted from entering certain locations to promote public safety in the same way ICE has been. \"Name another agency, another law enforcement agency, that has those type of requirements, that they can't walk into a school or doctor's office or a medical campus,\" he said. \"No other agency is held to those standards.\" \"These are well-trained [ICE] officers with a lot of discretion, and when it comes to a sensitive location, there's still going to be supervisory review,\" he said. \"But ICE officers should have discretion to decide if a national security threat or a public safety threat [is] in one of these facilities.\" Homan said anyone already in the country unlawfully \"should leave,\" and those looking to claim asylum should \"do it the legal way.\" \"Go to the embassy, go to the point of entry,\" he said. \"You shouldn't come to this country and ask to get asylum and the first thing you do is break our laws by entering illegally.\" In the meantime, Homan said the Trump administration is using not just the military but the \"whole\" government, including the Justice Department, to support its mass deportation plan, which allows ICE officers to concentrate on conducting enforcement operations. But Homan acknowledged that the federal government won't be able to remove every undocumented immigrant in the U.S., and that his \"success is going to be based on what Congress gives us.\" ICE doesn't currently have enough funding from Congress to detain all of the undocumented immigrants that the Trump administration says it hopes to arrest. \"I'm being realistic,\" he said. \"We can do what we can with the money we have. We're going to try to be efficient. But with more money we have, the more we can accomplish.\" \"What price [do] you put on national security?\" he added. \"When you … don't secure that border, that's when national security threats enter the country. That's when sex trafficking goes up. That's when, you know, that's when the fentanyl comes in.\" As for what success practically looks like at the end of the Trump administration, Homan said: \"Our success every day is taking a public safety threat off the streets or getting a national security threat out of here.\" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

President Donald Trump took a victory lap at a Las Vegas casino on Saturday after a five days of issuing executive orders on immigration, the economy, DEI and more. Trump late Friday night stirred up outrage when he blindsided at least 17 inspectors general at multiple federal agencies by firing them in an email from the White House personnel office. Meanwhile, two more of Trump's picks for his Cabinet -- Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense and Kristi Noem as secretary of Homeland Security -- were sworn in to office on Saturday. In a post on X thus morning, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that Belarus “just unilaterally released an innocent American, ANASTASSIA Nuhfer, who was taken under JOE BIDEN!” Rubio credited Trump and Chris Welby Smith, the State Department’s deputy assistant secretary for Eastern Europe, for the release.   Nuhfer was detained in early December 2024 and visited by a consular officer about three weeks ago, a State Department spokesperson said. -ABC News' Shannon Kingston Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, the top Trump appointee in the Justice Department, is currently in Chicago to “personally observe DHS immigration enforcement operations and support the efforts of FBI, DEA, ATF, USMS, and federal prosecutors who are assisting DHS in this critical mission,” a DOJ spokesperson told ABC News. The department declined to provide any additional details about Bove’s precise location or the planned “enforcement operations” he will be overseeing.   His presence on the ground, however, further highlights how the Trump administration plans to involve the highest level officials at DOJ as part of its broader show of force on immigration enforcement. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement said in a statement Sunday that it, \"along with federal partners, including the FBI, ATF, DEA, CBP and the U.S. Marshals Service, began conducting enhanced targeted operations today in Chicago to enforce U.S. immigration law and preserve public safety and national security by keeping potentially dangerous criminal aliens out of our communities.\" -ABC News' Alexander Mallin The Coast Guard said it's helping transport migrants who are in the country illegally and who are in locations where there aren't Defense Department assets. In a Saturday news release, the Coast Guard said it is conducting flights between Texas and California to get migrants to DOD bases to be removed from the country.   \"Border czar\" Tom Homan said the Trump administration isplanning to use military aircraftevery day to help carry out large-scale deportations. For the first time ever, the U.S. government is using military aircraft to transport migrants out of the U.S., Homan said. -ABC News' Luke Barr Kristi Noem was sworn in as secretary of Homeland Security Saturday afternoon.

NASA’s four Magnetospheric Multiscale, or MMS, satellites at the Astrotech Space Operations facility in Titusville, Florida, March 2015. (NASA via AP) NEW YORK (AP) — Scientists have detected cosmic waves thatsound like birds chirpingin an unexpected place. These bursts of plasma, called chorus waves, ripple at the same frequency ashuman hearing. When converted to audio signals, their sharp notes mimichigh-pitched bird calls. Researchers have captured such sounds in space before, but now they have sensed the chirping waves from much farther away: over 62,000 miles (100,000 kilometers) from Earth, where they’ve never been measured before. “That opens up a lot of new questions about the physics that could be possible in this area,” said Allison Jaynes, a space physicist at the University of Iowa who was not involved with the work. AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on scientists sensing a chirping chorus in an unexpected place. Scientists still aren’t sure how the perturbations happen, but they thinkEarth’s magnetic fieldmay have something to do with it. The chorus has been picked up on radio antennas for decades, including receivers at an Antarctica research station in the 1960s. And twin spacecraft — NASA’s Van Allen Probes — heard the chirps from Earth’s radiation belts at a closer distance than the newest detection. The latest notes were picked up by NASA’s Magnetospheric Multiscale satellites, launched in 2015 to explore the Earth and sun’s magnetic fields. The new researchwas published Wednesdayin the journal Nature. Chorus waves have also been spotted near other planets including Jupiter and Saturn. They can even produce high-energy electrons capable of scrambling satellite communications.   “They are one of the strongest and most significant waves in space,” said study author Chengming Liu from Beihang University in an email. The newfound chorus waves were detected in a region where Earth’s magnetic field is stretched out, which scientists didn’t expect. That raises fresh questions about how these chirping waves form. “It’s very captivating, very compelling,” Jaynes said. “We definitely need to find more of these events.” The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Still circling Earth, Firefly Aerospace’s lunar lander fired its thrusters Thursday to put it on a path to reach the moon in over a month. Dubbed Blue Ghost, the spacecraft beamed back photos and video of the Blue Marble, our planet. The Texas company released the images Friday. It carries experiments for NASA, part of the space agency’s effort toreturn astronauts to the moonthis decade. Blue Ghost is one of two lunar landers launched from Florida by SpaceX on Jan. 15. It’s targeting a moon touchdown on March 2. The other lander is sponsored by the Japanese company ispace and taking an even longer route, with a landing in late May or early June. It’s the first moonshot for Firefly and the second for ispace, whichcrashed its first landerinto the moon in 2023.

Meanwhile, the November ceasefire in Lebanon is holding despite ongoing Israeli airstrikes on Hezbollah targets, which Israeli officials say are responses to ceasefire violations by the Iranian-backed militant group. Israeli forces also remain active inside the Syrian border region as victorious rebels there build a transitional government. Tensions remain high between Israel and Iran after tit-for-tat long-range strikes in recent months and threats of further military action from both sides. The IDF and the Yemeni Houthis also continue to exchange attacks. The death toll from an attack Sunday by the Israel Defense Forces in southern Lebanon has climbed to 22, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. At least 124 people have been injured in the attack, including nine children, the health ministry said. Sunday was supposed to be the last day of a ceasefire deal that saw the IDF completely withdraw from Lebanon, but the IDF remains in several areas in the south. -ABC News' Victoria Beaule Jordanian officials have rejected President Trump's comments about Egypt and Jordan \"taking\" in more displaced Palestinians. Jordan's position \"rejecting the displacement of Palestinians is fixed and unchangeable and is necessary to achieve the stability and peace that we all want,\" Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Ayman Safadi said during a Foreign Ministry press conference on Sunday.   \"We renew our position of rejecting the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza. Our position is that the two-state solution is the way to achieve peace, and our rejection of displacement is fixed and unchangeable,\" Safadi said, stressing that \"the solution to the Palestinian issue is a Palestinian solution, and Jordan is for Jordanians and Palestine is for Palestinians.\" Safadi added, \"Our approach is clear, to establish the Palestinians in their land and implement the two-state solution.\" Safadi said a priority now is to consolidate the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and bring aid to the residents of the area. ”We are working to bring aid into Gaza without interruption in preparation for the start of reconstruction operations,\" Safadi said.

        "title": "No charges for Marilyn Manson after assault probe",
        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "Prosecutors say they won’t charge rocker Marilyn Manson after a years-long investigation into sexual assault and domestic violence allegations LOS ANGELES --Prosecutors said Friday that they will not file charges againstMarilyn Mansonafter a years-long investigation of allegations of sexual assault and domestic violence. Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said the allegations are too old under the law and the evidence is not sufficient to charge the 56-year-old shock rocker whose legal name is Brian Warner. “We have determined that allegations of domestic violence fall outside of the statute of limitations, and we cannot prove charges of sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt,” Hochman said. “We recognize and applaud the courage and resilience of the women who came forward to make reports and share their experiences, and we thank them for their cooperation and patience with the investigation.” Nearly four years after the investigation began, then-District Attorney George Gascón said on Oct. 9 that his office was pursuing new leads that added to the “already extensive” file that authorities had amassed. LA County sheriff’s detectives said early in 2021 that they were investigating Manson for incidents between 2009 and 2011 in West Hollywood, where Manson lived at the time. The probe included a search warrant that was served on his West Hollywood home. The case was initially turned over to prosecutors in September 2021, but the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office requested more evidence-gathering andthe investigation resumed. “We are very pleased that, after a thorough and incredibly lengthy review of all of the actual evidence, the District Attorney has concluded what we knew and expressed from the start — Brian Warner is innocent,” his attorney, Howard King, said in a statement. The identities of the women police and prosecutors spoke to were not revealed, but “Game of Thrones” actor Esmé Bianco — who sued Manson in a case that has been settled — said she was part of the criminal investigation. Before the decision not to prosecute, she criticized how long the process was taking at a rally for Hochman, who was elected soon after. “Almost four years ago, I did what victims of rape are supposed to do: I went to the police,” she said on Oct. 10. “I described to them in agonizing detail how the rock musician Brian Warner — better known by his stage name Marilyn Manson — had raped and abused me over the course of our relationship.” Bianco said she gave investigators “hundreds of pieces of evidence, including photos of my body covered in bites, bruises and knife wounds, emails and text messages, threats to my immigration status.” In her lawsuit, Bianco alleged sexual, physical and emotional abuse, and said that Manson violated human trafficking law by bringing her to California from England for non-existent roles in music videos and movies. “Whilst I am deeply disappointed by the decision of the District Attorney to not bring charges in the case against Brian Warner, I am sadly not surprised,” Bianco said in a statement released by her lawyer. “Once again, our justice system has failed survivors. Not the individual prosecutors and detectives who worked for years on this case, but the system that made them do so with one hand tied behind their collective backs.” In 2021 Manson's former fiancée, “Westworld” actor Evan Rachel Wood, named him as her abuser for the first time in an Instagram post. Wood and Manson’s relationship became public in 2007 when he was 38 and she was 19, and they were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up. “He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years,” Wood said. Manson replied on Instagram that these were “horrible distortions of reality.” He sued Wood, saying she and another woman fabricated accusations against him and convinced others to do the same. A judge threw out significant sections of the suit, then in November, Manson agreed to drop it and pay Wood's attorney fees. The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they’ve been sexually abused, unless they come forward publicly as Bianco and Wood have done. Other women sued Manson in the months after Wood came forward. Wood's representative did not immedately return a message Friday. Manson emerged as a musical star in the mid-1990s, known as much for courting public controversy as for hit songs like “The Beautiful People” and hit album’s like 1996’s “Antichrist Superstar” and 1998’s “Mechanical Animals.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(AP Photo/Marta Lavandier)           Dearica Hamby still smiles at the memory of Kobe Bryant sitting courtside at WNBA games. She had met him years ago. He came to see her old team, the Las Vegas Aces, play all the time. “I think one of the first things he told me was that I could play defense,” Hamby recalled. “And I was kind of like ‘Wha-at?’ ... That’s something I’ll cherish with me forever.” That epitomized the late NBA great’s relationship with the women’s game. After his 20-year playing career ended, Bryant turned his focus to the next generation, mentoring some of women’s basketball’s biggest stars, from WNBA champion and Olympic gold medalist Diana Taurasi to former Oregon star Sabrina Ionescu. He worked out with them, analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of their game and pushed for them to reach the same heights in popularity that he and his NBA peers did. For Hamby, now with the Los Angeles Sparks, Bryant saw an aspect of her game she didn’t even know she had. “If Kobe tells you you can play defense, you can play defense,” she quipped. Five years after Bryant, 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven otherswere killed in a helicopter crashin Calabasas, California, several women’s basketball players reflected on what he meant to their game and how he championed it. Many of them thought Bryant would be pleased with the overall progress of women’s sports, which haveskyrocketed in popularity and reachin recent years. That growth has been most prominent in the women’s basketball arenas that Bryant and Gianna loved so much.  The WNBA last season had its most-watched regular season in 24 years and its best attendance in 22 seasons. Some of the league’s most popular players currently are competing in a new3-on-3 leaguein South Florida called Unrivaled, founded by Olympic gold medalists Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart. “We carry this on for him,” said Satou Sabally, a forward with the WNBA’s Dallas Wings who plays for the Phantom squad in Unrivaled. “He would be so proud of this league. He would be proud of ’Phe and Stewie. I know that he’s looking down and hopefully he’s smiling and is proud of us.” Sabally said she still gets emotional when she thinks of that day on Jan. 26, 2020. It reminds her of her playing days at Oregon, when she, Ionescu and their Ducks teammates connected over Bryant. “I think about ... how we all bonded together over Kobe and how we bonded together for the rest of our lives because he was so impactful,” Sabally added. “He was really a person that saw us women as the talents who we are. He came to the games, he was so outspoken and he really was really supportive.” The shock of the superstar’s death echoed throughout the sports and entertainment worlds, with many taking to social media to post emotional tributes to Bryant while expressing their disbelief. People were glued to their phones and TV screens as news of the crash spread. NBA players were in tears ahead of games that day. “I still remember exactly where I was whenever we heard the news,” said Kate Martin of the Golden State Valkyries, playing for Laces BC at Unrivaled, “and no one really knew if it was fake or real. I think that’s just one of those things where you’re just always going to remember exactly where you were when you heard that.” Martin never met Bryant but said she cherishes his mentality — he had a relentless competitiveness — and the way he elevated women’s sports. Bryant became heavily involved with his daughters’ hoops journeys and coached Gianna’s youth team. He was often at women’s basketball games, especially college ones, with Gianna, who was fascinated with the UConn Huskies. Gianna was in line to further Bryant’s legacy on the court. The plan was for her to attend Connecticut, and surely the WNBA was next. Bryant was passionate about women’s sports despite the belief of some that he should not have been involved with the women’s game at all because of a 2003 charge accusing him of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old employee at a Colorado resort. Bryant had said the two had consensual sex, and the charge was eventually dropped when the woman declined to testify at trial. The woman later filed a civil suit against Bryant that was settled out of court. There’s an image that still circulates in the sports world today: Kobe and Gianna sitting courtside at a 2019 game featuring his Los Angeles Lakers. He wore a bright orange pullover with a white WNBA logo on the front. Gianna sat beaming at his side. “I think a lot of people started to follow behind Kobe because he recognized our gift and our talent and how special it really is,” said former Chicago Sky head coach Teresa Weatherspoon, the current coach of Unrivaled’s Vinyl BC. “And his daughter was right there as well.” That’s who Bryant had become — a face of women’s sports advocacy. “He’s greatly missed,” Martin said. “But now his legacy will live on forever.” AP WNBA:https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)                                                       MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — There’s all sorts of ways beyond merely the score to measure just how dominantJannik Sinnerwas while outplaying and frustratingAlexander Zverevduring the 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 victory Sunday that earned the 23-year-old Italian a second consecutiveAustralian Openchampionship.  The zero break points Sinner faced. Or the 10 he accumulated. The 27-13 advantage in points that lasted at least nine strokes. Or the way Sinner accumulated more winners, 32 to 25, and fewer unforced errors, 27 to 45. The way Sinner won 10 of the 13 points that ended with him at the net. Or the way he only let Zverev go 14 of 27 in that category, frequently zipping passing shots out of reach.  Well, here’s is one more bit of evidence: what Zverev said about Sinner.  “I’m serving better than him, but that’s it. He does everything else better than me. He moves better than me. He hits his forehand better than me. He hits his backhand better than me. He returns better than me. He volleys better than me,” Zverev said. “At the end of the day, tennis has five or six massive shots — like, massive factors — and he does four or five of them better than me. That’s the reason why he won.”  High praise from a guy who is, after all, ranked No. 2. Sinner has held the No. 1 spot since last June andis not showing any signs of relinquishing it. This was the first Australian Open final between the men at No. 1 and No. 2 since 2019, whenNo. 1 Novak Djokovic defeated No. 2 Rafael Nadal— also in straight sets.  “It’s amazing,” Sinner said, “to achieve these things.”   The “things” include being the youngest man to leave Melbourne Park with the trophy two years in a row since Jim Courier in 1992-93, and the first man sinceNadalat the French Open in 2005 and 2006 to follow up his firstGrand Slamtitle by repeating as the champion at the same tournament a year later.

(AP Photo/Manish Swarup)   Sinner was asked later whether he felt more relief or excitement when he raised his arms after the last point was his.  “This one was joy. We managed to do something incredible this time, because the situation I was in was completely different from a year ago here,” he said. “I had more pressure.”  Probably true, but’s hard to tell.  Go to the start of 2024, and take stock. In that span, Sinner has won three of the five major tournaments, including the U.S. Open in September, meaning he now has claimed three straight hard-court Slams. His record is 80-6 with nine titles. His current unbeaten run covers 21 matches.  “There’s always something that can get better,” said one of his two coaches, Simone Vagnozzi. “He is playing really well right now and everything comes easily. But there will be tough moments ahead.”  The only thing that’s clouded the past 12 months for Sinner, it seems,is the doping casein which his exoneration was appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency. He tested positive for a trace amount of an anabolic steroid twice last March but blamed it on an accidental exposure involving two members of his team who have since been fired. Sinner initially was cleared in August; ahearing in the WADA appealis scheduled for April.  “I keep playing like this because I have a clear mind on what happened,” Sinner said Sunday. “I know if I would be guilty, I would not play like this.”  While he became the eighth man in the Open era (which began in 1968) to start his career 3-0 in Grand Slam finals,Zverev is the seventh to be 0-3, adding this loss to those at the 2020 U.S. Open and last year’s French Open.  Those earlier setbacks both came in five sets. This contest was not that close. Not at all.  “I’ll keep doing everything I can,” Zverev said, “to lift one of those trophies.”  Just beforeZverev began speakinginto a microphone during the trophy ceremony, a voice cried out from the stands, making reference to two of the player’s ex-girlfriends whoaccused him of physical abuse.  During the match, there truly was only one moment that contained a hint of tension. It came when Zverev was two points from owning the second set at 5-4, love-30. But a break point — and a set point — never arrived.  A year ago, Sinner went through a lot more trouble to earn his first major, needing to get past Novak Djokovic —who quit one set into his semifinalagainst Zverev on Friday because of a torn hamstring — beforeerasing a two-set deficit in the finalagainst 2021 U.S. Open champion Daniil Medvedev.  This time, Sinner applied pressure with an all-around style that does not really appear to have holes.  He proved superior in every meaningful way other than aces, leaving Zverev shaking his head or trudging to the sideline with shoulders sagging or cracking his racket against the court or against another racket.  Perfectly understandable, given what Sinner can do to an opponent, especially on a hard court.  “The facts speak for themselves,” Zverev said. “He’s in a different universe right now.”   Howard Fendrich has been the AP’s tennis writer since 2002.

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)                 PARK CITY, Utah (AP) —Rose Byrneplays a mother in the midst of a breakdown in the experiential psychological thriller “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You.” Anticipation was high for the A24 film, which will be released sometime this year. Its premiere Friday at theSundance Film Festivalwas easily the hottest ticket in town, with even ticketholders unable to get in. Those who did make it into the Library theater were treated to an intense, visceral, inventive story from filmmaker Mary Bronstein that has quickly become one of the festival’s must-sees. Byrne plays Linda, who is barely hanging on while managing her daughter’s mysterious illness. She’s faced with crisis after crisis, big and small — from the massive, gaping hole in their apartment ceiling that forces them to move to a dingy motel, to an escalating showdown with a parking attendant at a care center. The cracks in her psychological, emotional and physical wellbeing are become too much to bear. “I’d never seen a movie before where a mother is going through a crisis with a child but our energy is not with the child’s struggle, it’s with the mother’s,” Bronstein said at the premiere. “If you’re a caretaker, you shouldn’t be bothering with yourself at all. It should all be about the person you’re taking care of, right? And that is a particular kind of emotional burnout state that I was really interested in exploring.” Byrne and Bronstein went deep in the preparation phase, having long discussions about Linda with the goal of making her as real as possible before the quick, 27-day shoot. Byrne said she was obsessed with figuring out who Linda was before the crisis. The film was in part inspired by Bronstein’s experience with her own daughter, but she didn’t want to elaborate on the specifics.  “That’s her story to tell,” Bronstein said. Part of Linda’s story involves her therapist, played byConan O’Brien, who joked that he didn’t realize he was in a movie. “I’m not looking out for movie scripts or anything. But when I got a call from A24 that they wanted me to read something, I’m not stupid,” O’Brien said. “I showed it to my wife, who is one of the smartest people I know, and she read through it and she said, ‘I didn’t know they made movies like this anymore.’” He was particularly in awe of his director and co-star, saying he felt like a fraud standing beside them. “It was an amazing experience, one of the best experiences of my life, just to be with them and watch them work,” O’Brien said. “I don’t know how (Byrne) did that and not check into a hospital afterwards, because I haven’t seen any actor, man or woman, sustain that level for an entire movie.” “I feel like I have to go to a hospital now, because this was the first time I watched it,” he added. “I’m a mess.” A$AP Rockyalso co-stars, as a man Linda meets at the motel, but was not in Park City for the premiere. He is currentlyon trial, charged with firing a gun at a former friend. The film is full of ambiguity, metaphor and just plain artistic expression that Bronstein hesitated to explain, from the name itself to the hole in the ceiling, which takes on a somewhat supernatural quality. “When we have nothing left to give, we have an emptiness inside of us,” Bronstein said. “And that emptiness is actually not empty: It’s filled with all the darkness and self-hate and doubt and fear and dread and regret and everything. … That to me is what the hole is.” Some of it, she said, she doesn’t even fully understand. The point is the experience, and critics and Sundance audiences are already fully on board. Bronstein, a bit of a cult figure in the film world, made her directorial debut in 2008 at the SXSW festival with “Yeast,” which featured a pre-fame Greta Gerwig and was hailed by by New Yorker critic Richard Brody as a “mumblecore classic.” “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” is only her second feature. “This is the first time that anybody else has paid for me to make art,” Bronstein said. “I’m proud to say that this is the film that came directly from my head to the screen.” For more coverage of the 2025 Sundance Film Festival, visit:https://apnews.com/hub/sundance-film-festival   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "Researchers say they are puzzled over the discovery. Astronomers have detected fast-repeating radio bursts from a distant \"dead\" galaxy that should not contain the energy to produce these types of signals, according to new research. The source of the fast radio bursts (FRBs) -- sudden flashes of radio waves that last just milliseconds -- has previously been linked to young, magnetized neutron stars that expend a lot of energy when they are forming. But the dormant galaxy from which these radio bursts are originating should not contain this type of young star, according to a paper published Wednesday inThe Astrophysical Journal Letters. Researchers expect FRBs to originate inside of a galaxy and, because these FRBs are so energetic, within a region of a galaxy in which new stars are actively forming, Vishwangi Shah, a PhD student in the Department of Physics and the Trottier Space Institute at McGill University, told ABC News. These FRBs, named FRB 20240209A, are located outside of the massive ancient elliptical galaxy it is associated with that only contains old and dead stars, Shah said. \"This discovery was really surprising and exciting,\" she said. Shah and her team used the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment -- also known as the CHIME telescope -- to detect the multiple bursts from the same location, Shah said. But because the CHIME telescope could not pinpoint the exact location of the radio waves, they combined it with a smaller CHIME-like telescope to pinpoint the location of the FRB. They then used the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii to image the region around the location of the FRBs. The Gemini image confirmed that there is no other galaxy present near the FRB and the FRB is indeed associated with the dead galaxy. \"There's no other galaxy there,\" Shah said. The ancient elliptical galaxy where astronomers discovered the radio waves is about 2 billion light-years from Earth and is about 11.3 billion years old, according to the paper. Thousands of radio bursts have been recorded since 2007, when they were first discovered by astronomers, Shah said, adding that they only know the precise locations of about 100 of them -- all near actively forming stars. \"This particular FRB is really an outlier, and it challenges our theories about what is producing FRBs,\" Shah said. Astronomers hypothesize that the FRBs could be originating from two supernova remnants, called neutron stars, that are merging or collapsing onto themselves, Shah said. Continuing to study these FRBs will allow researchers to further understand the space between its origination and the Milky Way as well as what is happening in distant regions of space, Shah said. \"That is why it is a really useful probe of our universe,\" she said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "content": "The Democratic senator also said Tulsi Gabbard isn't qualified to serve as DNI. Michigan Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin explained why she voted against confirming Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense on ABC News' \"This Week\" on Sunday, saying she had not been confident Hegseth would be more loyal to the Constitution than he would be to President Donald Trump.. Hegseth, a former Fox News host, was sworn into the role on Saturday following a razor-thin vote in the Senate. Slotkin, who joined the Senate in January and previously worked for multiple national security agencies, including the Department of Defense, told \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz that it was important in confirmation hearings that nominees knew they were \"raising your right hand and pledging an oath to the Constitution -- not Donald Trump -- and that if Donald Trump asks you to do something that contravenes the Constitution, you would push back.\" \"He couldn't unambiguously say that he will push back if the president asked him to do something that wasn't constitutional, and that, to me, is why I couldn't confirm him,\" Slotkin said. \"There's a lot of other things in his background I don't like, but I look at what is the strategic and irreversible threats to our democracy, and that's using the uniform military in ways that violate the Constitution.\" The vote to confirm Hegseth was initially 50-50 until Vice President JD Vance, in his role as president of the Senate, cast the tie-breaking vote. Every Democrat voted against Hegseth's confirmation, as did Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. His nomination process was marred by accusations ofsexual misconduct, excessive drinking and financial mismanagement of two different veterans organizations. He hasdeniedall the allegations. During Hegseth's confirmation hearing, Slotkin questioned him on whether he supports active-duty military members supporting immigrant detention centers if ordered to do so by Trump. With 1,500 soldiers and Marines now at or deploying to the border, Slotkin stressed on \"This Week\" that the military should not take on a law enforcement role in this new mission. \"According to our Constitution, you can go in supporting roles -- logistics, driving, setting up facilities, setting up, you know, border locations, whatever -- it's very different when you cross the line into law enforcement,\" she said. \"Our military are not trained as law enforcement officers -- they'll be the first one to tell you that. That's not why they got into service, and it's also in violation of our Constitution, so I think it's very important that we keep that line.\" Slotkin said it was important to know \"you're not going to use the uniform military in ways that violates the Constitution and makes American citizens scared of their own military.\" \"We were scared of the British when they occupied us,\" she said. \"We don't want to repeat that, so I'm watching that very, very closely.\" Slotkin also spoke about Tulsi Gabbard's upcoming confirmation hearing for the role of director of national intelligence. Slotkin was one of the first employees in the director's office, working there between 2005 and 2006 in between stints at the CIA as an analyst. \"I served with Tulsi Gabbard. We were on the Armed Services Committee together. She didn't spend a lot of time showing up to hearings, so I didn't get to see her in action all that much,\" Slotkin said. \"But from what I understand from people who have been meeting directly with her -- and she hasn't asked to meet with me -- is that she doesn't show the competence, the understanding, the depth. She wasn't prepared for her meetings, not to mention the deeply questionable decisions she's made of cozying up to [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, flying and cozying up with Assad in Syria.\" Slotkin said she does \"not believe [Gabbard] is qualified for this role.\" \"You know, having someone in charge of our intelligence organization that shows a preference for our adversaries, to me, is just right off the bat, a deep question,\" Slotkin said. \"And so again, I hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who now have control of the Senate, control of the House, that they think about, again, their commitment to the country, not to any one party.\" Gabbard's confirmation hearing is scheduled for Thursday before the Senate Intelligence Committee. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)               SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean prosecutors on Sunday indictedimpeached President Yoon Suk Yeolon rebellion in connection with his short-lived imposition of martial law, a criminal charge that could incur the death penalty or life imprisonment if convicted. This is thelatest blow to Yoon, who was impeached and arrested over his Dec. 3 martial law decree that plunged the country intopolitical turmoil, shook its financial markets and hurt its international image. Separate from criminal judicial proceedings, the Constitutional Court is now deliberating whether to formally dismiss Yoon as president or reinstate him. Yoon has become South Korea’s first president who has been indicted while in office. He will remain jailed and be escorted from a detention facility to a Seoul court for hearings in the trial, which is expected to last about six months. Prosecutors said in a statement that they indicted Yoon on charges that he directed a rebellion when he imposed martial law. Investigative authorities have earlier alleged that Yoon’s imposition of martial law amounted to rebellion, because he staged riots with the purpose of undermining the constitution. Yoon’s defense team lashed out at the indictment, calling it “the worst decision” by prosecutors who they say are trying to curry favor with political forces who want Yoon’s exit. “Today’s indictment of the president will remain as a shame in the history of South Korean prosecutors that they cannot erase,” Yoon’s defense team said in a statement. “We stress once again that a president’s declaration of martial law can never be rebellion.”  Yoon has presidential immunity from most criminal prosecutions, but the privilege doesn’t extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. By law in South Korea, the leader of a rebellion can face a life sentence or capital punishment. Yoon, a conservative, has steadfastlydenied any wrongdoing, describing his declaration of martial law as a legitimate act of governance meant to raise public awareness of the danger of the liberal-controlled National Assembly, which obstructed his agenda and impeached top officials. During his announcement of martial law, Yoon called the assembly “a den of criminals” and vowed to eliminate “shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces.” After declaring martial law on Dec. 3, Yoon sent troops and police officers to the assembly, but enough lawmakers still managed to enter an assembly chamber to vote down Yoon’s decree unanimously, forcing his Cabinet to lift it. The martial law imposition,the first of its kindin South Korea in more than four decades, lasted only six hours. However, it evoked painful memories of past dictatorial rules in South Korea in the 1960s-80s when military-backed rulers used martial laws and emergency decrees to suppress opponents. South Korea’s constitution gives the president the power to declare martial law to keep order in wartime and other comparable emergency states, but many experts say the country wasn’t under such conditions when Yoon declared martial law. Yoon insists that he hadno intentions of disrupting assembly work, including its floor vote on his decree and that deploying troops and police forces was meant to maintain order. But commanders of military units sent to the assembly have told assembly hearings or investigators that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to prevent them from overturning his decree. Investigations on Yoon have intensified the country’s already serious internal division,with rival protestersregularly staging rallies in downtown Seoul. After a local court on Jan. 19 approved a formal arrest warrant to extend Yoon’s detention, dozens of his supporters stormed the court building, destroying windows, doors and other property. They also attacked police officers with bricks, steel pipes and other objects. The violence left 17 police officers injured, and police said that they detained 46 protesters. Yoon earlier resisted efforts by investigative authorities to question or detain him.He then was apprehended on Jan. 15in a huge law enforcement operation at his presidential compound. Leading Yoon’s investigation was the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, but Yoon has refused to attend CIO questioning sessions since being detained, saying it has no legal authority to investigate rebellion allegations. The CIO has said that it can investigate Yoon’s rebellion allegation because it’s related to his purported abuse of power and other allegations. The CIO handed over Yoon’s case to the Seoul prosecutors’ office on Friday and asked it to indict him on charges of rebellion, abuse of power and obstruction of the National Assembly. Prosecutors said they indicted Yoon only on rebellion, considering that Yoon had presidential immunity from other charges. Yoon’s defense minister, police chief and several other military commanders have already been arrested on alleged rebellion, abuse of power and other charges related to the martial law decree. If the Constitutional Court rules to drive Yoon out of office, a national election to choose his successor must be held within two months. Recent public surveys show that governing and opposition party candidates are running neck-and-neck in a possible presidential by-election race.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

In an interview with ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz, Homan said that only days after Trump took office, the U.S. government for the first time ever used military aircraft to transport migrants back to their home country, and it will now be a daily occurrence. According to U.S. officials, the U.S. military on Thursday flew more than 150 migrants to Guatemala on two separate flights. But Homan made clear that the military flights are just one part of a much broader plan. He claimed that – unlike under the Biden administration –Immigrationand Customs Enforcement officers are now free to arrest any of the estimated more than 11 million immigrants in the country without legal status, not just those identified as priorities for deportation for being convicted criminals or other public safety threats. Watch more of Martha Raddatz' interview with Tom Homan Sunday on ABC's 'This Week' \"If you're in the country illegally, you're on the table because it's not okay to, you know, violate the laws of this country,\" he said. Homan said that while the Trump administration's enforcement actions are currently prioritizing public safety and national security threats, they're going to \"open up the aperture\" in the weeks and months ahead. \"As that aperture opens, there'll be more arrests nationwide,\" he said. Homan also offered another possible solution for \"those who are in the country illegally\": They \"should leave\" on their own, he said. Early in the Biden administration, then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas issued guidance to immigration enforcement officers discouraging them from \"spending resources to remove those who do not pose a threat\" and noting that many undocumented immigrants inside the country \"have been here for generations and contributed to our country's well-being,\" as he put it in a statement at the time. Homan, however, noted that the nation’s immigration laws were passed by Congress to be enforced, and said immigrants without legal status are violating those laws.

(AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi)       Ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon appeared at risk on Sunday as disputes continued over key deadlines, and local health officials said that Israeli forces opened fire on both fronts. In Gaza,Israel accused Hamasof violating the ceasefire there by changing the order of hostages it has released. Citing that, Israel has stopped thousands of Palestinians from returning to the northern part ofthe Gaza Stripas expected by Sunday. Local health officials said that Israeli forces fired on the crowd, killing two. Israel said civilian hostage Arbel Yehoud should have been releasedbefore the four soldiers freed on Saturday. Mediators the United States, Qatar and Egypt were working on the issue. In Lebanon, health officials said thatIsraeli forces opened fireon protesters in the south who demanded that Israel withdraw in line with the ceasefire agreement, killing at least 22. Separately, officials with Hamas and Jordan rejected U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion that most of Gaza’s populationshould be at least temporarily resettled elsewhere, including in Egypt and Jordan. The war in Gaza broke out after Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people in southern Israel in an attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and abducted around 250. Israel’s retaliatory military operation has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of thevictims childrenand women, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians. Here is the latest: RAMALLAH, West Bank — The office of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has sharply condemned U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion to “clean out” the Gaza Strip and request that Egypt and Jordan take in more Palestinians. In a statement, the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited control over parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, says the prospect of mass displacement from the Gaza Strip “constitutes a violation of the red lines that we have repeatedly warned against.” “Our people will not leave,” the statement said. “We warn of the repercussions of such a dangerous Israeli policy that contributes to severing the ties of the Gaza Strip, and displacing its people, which will lead to destabilization and security.” Trump’s remarks suggesting that Palestinians be encouraged to leave Gaza gets at the core of Palestinian fears that they will be driven from their remaining homeland. The Palestinian presidency said it was “ready to assume its full duties in the Gaza Strip” in hopes of eventually establishing an independent Palestinian state. The Palestinian Authority, based in the West Bank city of Ramallah, briefly controlled Gaza after Israeli troops withdrew in 2005, only to be driven out by its rival Hamas two years later. PARIS — France will consider allowing Israeli companies to participate in the Paris Air Show in June, thanks to ceasefire agreements in Gaza and Lebanon, the French president’s office said Sunday. That was among the results of a conversation Sunday between French President Emmanuel Macron and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Macron said France hopes to help speed up the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza, two of whom are French citizens. Macron also urged Israel to allow for a ″massive″ facilitation of aid to Gaza’s population, and to fulfill its promises to withdraw troops from Lebanon under a truce brokered by the U.S. and France. Netanyahu asked about Israeli participation in the upcoming Paris Air Show at Le Bourget, a major industry event. The French president said Israeli participation ″could be favorably considered, as a consequence of the cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon,″ according to Macron’s office. Tensions surrounded Israel’s participation in twoarms shows in Francelast year, Eurosatory and Euronaval. The French government did not want Israel displaying any weapons used in its wars in Gaza and Lebanon. RAMALLAH, West Bank — A spokesman for the Islamic Jihad, Gaza’s second-largest militant group, says the dispute over an Israeli hostage that has kept Palestinians from returning home to northern Gaza has been settled. Mohamed al-Hajj Mousa added in a statement that the group told mediators that the hostage, Arbel Yehoud, will be released before Saturday, when the next exchange of hostages from Gaza for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody is set to take place. There is no immediate comment from Israel, which has accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire by changing the order of hostages it has released. It expected Yehoud to be freed this weekend, and it has put the movement of Palestinians into northern Gaza on hold. RAMALLAH, West Bank — The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees says that if Israel carries out its threat to close its east Jerusalem headquarters on Thursday, the outsize effects will be felt acutely and immediately by tens of thousands of Palestinians. The agency, known as UNRWA, runs 12 facilities that provide critical public services across east Jerusalem, including schools enrolling at least 1,200 children and free clinics serving over 70,000 people. “That’s the thing, it has an impact on people’s lives,” Juliette Touma, a spokeswoman for UNRWA, said of the potential closure. In the Shuafat refugee camp, an impoverished neighborhood, “people today can walk just a few meters and they’re in an excellent clinic,” Touma said. But if it’s shuttered, she said, tens of thousands of Palestinians would have to cross a difficult checkpoint, pay for transport and, even if they’re eligible for Israeli primary health care, also pay for medicine in order to see a doctor or get a blood test. “We’re talking about the poorest of the poor,” Touma said. “Right now, they have no alternative.” The closure of UNRWA schools would raise all sorts of problems given that there are already too few classrooms in the overcrowded Palestinian areas of east Jerusalem, she said. Touma said much remains unclear about the Israeli order, including whether the closure would apply to operations in east Jerusalem only or to the entirety of the Palestinian territories. Israel says the agency has allowed itself to be infiltrated by Hamas, allegations denied by the U.N. TEL AVIV, Israel — Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and former National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, both want Israel to establish Jewish settlements in Gaza, supported Trump’s remarks, calling it “voluntary emigration.” Palestinians and many of their supporters view it as code for ethnic cleansing. In a post on X Sunday, Smotrich called the idea of “helping (Palestinians) find other places to start new, good lives” great and said he would work with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to that end. Ben-Gvir, who quit Netanyahu’s government over the current ceasefire in Gaza, said Trump’s remarks gave Israel the green light to move ahead on “voluntary emigration.” “When the president of the world’s largest superpower brings it up himself, the government of Israel should implement it,” he said in a statement. Netanyahu has said building Jewish settlements in Gaza is not realistic. Israel withdrew troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but maintains a blockade with Egypt on the territory. JERUSALEM — The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees says its staff was directed to vacate the premises by Thursday. Israelpassed legislation last yearcutting all ties with the agency and barring it from operating in its territory. It says the agency, which is the main provider of aid in the Gaza Strip, has allowed itself to be infiltrated by Hamas, allegations denied by the U.N. In a statement Sunday, the agency, known as UNRWA, said the order to vacate “is in contradiction to international law obligations of U.N. member states,” including Israel. “United Nations premises are inviolable and enjoy privileges and immunities under the United Nations Charter.” UNRWA closed its east Jerusalem headquarters last May after Israeli protesters set fire to its perimeter. DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Bassem Naim said that “even if seemingly well-intentioned under the guise of reconstruction,” the Palestinian people will never agree to such a proposal. He also said the Palestinians can rebuild Gaza “even better than before”if Israel lifts its blockade. DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli forces fired on the crowds on three occasions overnight and into Sunday. Those killed included a child, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel has pulled back from several areas of Gaza as part of the ceasefire, which came into force last Sunday, but the military has warned people to stay away from its forces, which are still operating in a buffer zone inside Gaza along the border and in the Netzarim corridor.

Huh) LOS ANGELES (AP) — The latest evidence that homeownership is becoming increasingly less accessible to many Americans: Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last year to a nearly 30-year low for the second time in as many years. Elevated mortgage rates, a yearslong shortage of homes on the market andrecord-high home pricescontinued to stymie prospective home shoppers, especially first-time buyers. That led existing home sales to fall 0.7% last year to 4.06 million — the weakest showing for home sales since 1995 and edging out the terrible year for sales in 2023, the National Association of Realtors said Friday. Even in the midst of a sales slump, a dearth of homes on the market and rising mortgage rates gave sellers an edge over buyers, helping drive up the national median home price for all of last year to an all-time high $407,500, an increase of 4.7% from a year earlier. “How is it possible that home sales can be this low, considering that the U.S. population has increased by more than 70 million over this time period from 1995 to today?” asked Lawrence Yun, the NAR’s chief economist. “One can partly answer that question because of the affordability issue. Record-high home prices, mortgage rates having risen, but also lack of inventory.” The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump dating back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage surged to a 23-year high of nearly 8% in October 2023 and briefly fell to a 2-year low last September, but has beenmostly hovering around 7%,according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac.  The buying power of Americans now facing higher costs to borrow money for homes that have soared in value has been significantly stunted. With so few homes up for sale, millions of would-be homebuyers have found themselves on the sidelines. At the end of December, there were just 1.15 million homes on the market, NAR said. While that was up 16.2% from a year earlier, the inventory remained well below the annual historical average of about 1.98 million, according to data going back to 1999. The available inventory at the end of last month amounts to a 3.3-month supply, going by the current sales pace. In a more balanced market between buyers and sellers, there is a 4- to 6-month supply. “This means that the problems in the U.S. housing market continue to worsen in terms of availability of homes for sale and the upward pressure on home prices,” Eugenio Aleman, chief economist at Raymond James, wrote in a research note. Many factors have contributed to the housing shortage, including more than a decade of below-average new home construction and homeowners hanging on to their properties longer. And while President Donald Trump made increasing the housing supply one of his election campaign platforms, there are no quick fixes. “Over the past decade, the U.S. has averaged about 5.2 million home sales annually,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS. “It is going to take years before we are back at that level, maybe not even until the 2030s. The lack of inventory is the key constraint.” A sharp drop in the mortgage rate boosted the purchasing power of Americans in 2020 and 2021. While many economists predict that the average rate on a 30-year mortgage will ease this year, they generally don’t expect it to fall below 6%, about twice what it was five years ago. When mortgage rates ease, they can encourage home shoppers. A pullback in rates last fall helped home sales increase on a monthly basis in the last three months of the year. Home sales in December rose 2.2% from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis to a 4.24 million annual pace, NAR said. That topped the 4.2 million pace forecast by analysts polled by FactSet. Sales rose 9.3% in December versus the same month last year. The median home sales price rose for the 18th consecutive month in December to $404,000, up 6% from a year earlier. Limited inventory, especially in the more affordable price range of a given market, helps drive prices higher. That’s one reason many first-time homebuyers, who don’t have any home equity to put toward their down payment, continue to struggle. They accounted for 31% of all homes sold last month, up from 30% in November and 29% in December 2023. However, the annual share of first-time buyers was 24%. It’s been 40% historically.

(AP Photo/Ben Curtis)           WASHINGTON (AP) —President Donald Trump’sfirst week in office isn’t over yet, but already itoffers signalsabout how his next four years in the White House may unfold. Some takeaways from the earliest days of his second term: Within hours of being sworn in, Trumppardoned more than 1,500people who were convicted or charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by his supporters. Those pardonedinclude people who attacked, bloodied and beat police officers that day. The Republican president’s decision was at odds with earlier comments by his incoming vice president, JD Vance, and other senior aides that Trump would only let off those who weren’t violent. The pardons were the first of many moves he made in his first week to reward allies and punish critics, in both significant and subtle ways. It signaled that without the need to worry about reelection — the Constitution bars a third term — or legal consequences after the Supreme Court granted presidents expansive immunity, the new president, backed by a Republican Congress, has little to restrain him. Trump ended protective security details forDr. Anthony Fauci, his former COVID-19 adviser, along with former national security adviser John Bolton, formerSecretary of State Mike Pompeoand his onetime deputy. The security protections had been regularly extended by the Biden administration over credible threats to the men’s lives. Trump alsorevokedthe security clearances of dozens of former government officials who had criticized him, including Bolton, and directed that the portrait of a former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, retired Gen. Mark Milley be removed from the Pentagon walls.  In his first days in office, Trump demonstrated just how much he and his team had learned from four often-chaotic years in the White House and four more in political exile. A president’s most valuable resource is time and Trump set out in his first hours to make his mark on the nation with executive orders, policy memoranda and government staffing shake-ups. It reflected a level of sophistication that eluded him in his first term and surpassed his Democratic predecessors in its scale and scope for their opening days in the Oval Office. Feeling burned by the holdover of Obama administration appointees during his first go-around, Trumpswiftly exiledBiden holdovers and moved to test new hires for their fealty to his agenda. In a matter of days heuprooted four yearsof diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the federal government, sent federal troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and erased Biden’s guardrails on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency development. In his first term, Trump’s early executive orders were more showpieces than substance and frequently were blocked by federal courts. This time, Trump is still confronting the limits of his constitutional authorities, but is also far more adept at controlling what is within them. An hour after concluding a relatively sedate inaugural address in the Capitol Rotunda, Trump decided to let loose. Speaking to an overflow crowd of governors, political supports and dignitaries in the Capitol Visitor Center’s Emancipation Hall, Trump ripped in to Biden, the Justice Department and other perceived rivals. He followed it up with an even longer speech to supporters at a downtown arena and in more than 50 minutes of remarks and questions and answers with reporters in the Oval Office. For all of Trump’s experience and organization, he is still very much the same Donald Trump, and just as intent as before on dominating the center of the national conversation. If not more. He has acted to try to end civil service protections for many federal workers andoverturn more than a century of lawon birthright citizenship. Such moves have been a magnet for legal challenges. In the case of the birthright citizenship order, it met swift criticism from U.S. District Judge John Coughenour, who put a temporary stay on Trump’s plans. “I’ve been on the bench for over four decades. I can’t remember another case where the question presented was as clear as this one is,” Coughenour, who was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan, told a Justice Department attorney. “This is a blatantly unconstitutional order.” How those court cases play out will determine not only the fate of some of Trump’s most controversial actions, but just how far any president can go in pushing an agenda. The president likes to call it “liquid gold.” His main economic assumption is that more oil production by the United States, the Saudis and the rest of OPEC would bring down prices. That would reduce overall inflation and cut down on the oil revenues that Russia is using to fund its war in Ukraine. For Trump, oil is the answer. He’s betting that fossil fuels are the future, despite the climate change risks. “The United States has the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth, and we’re going to use it,” Trump said in a Thursday speech. “Not only will this reduce the cost of virtually all goods and services, it’ll make the United States a manufacturing superpower and the world capital of artificial intelligence and crypto” Trump had theworld’s wealthiest menbehind him on the dais when he took the oath of office on Monday. Tesla’s Elon Musk, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and LVMH’s Bernard Arnault were all there. SoftBank billionaire Masayoshi Son was in the audience. Later in the week, Oracle’s Larry Ellison and OpenAI’s Sam Altman appeared with Son at the White House to announce an artificial intelligence investment of up to $500 billion. Musk, the Trump backer who is leading the president’s Department of Government Efficiency effort, posted on X that SoftBank didn’t have the money. Altman, a rival to to Musk on AI, responded over X that the funding was there. By surrounding himself with the wealthiest people in tech, Trump is also stuck in their drama. “The people in the deal are very, very smart people,” Trump said Thursday. “But Elon, one of the people, he happens to hate. But I have certain hatreds of people, too.” America’s 25th president has a big fan in Trump. Trump likes the tariffs that were imposed during Republican William McKinley’s presidency and helped to fund the government. Trump has claimed the country was its wealthiest in the 1890s when McKinley was in office. But McKinley might not be a great economic role model for the 21st century. For starters, the Tax Foundation found that federal receipts were equal to just 3% of the overall economy in 1900, McKinley’s reelection year. Tax revenues are now equal to about 17% of the U.S. economy and that’s still not enough to fund the government without running massive deficits. So it would be hard to go full McKinley without some chaos. As Dartmouth College economist Douglas Irwin noted on X, the economic era defined by McKinley was not that great for many people. “There was a little something called the Panic of 1893 and the unemployment rate was in double digits from 1894-98!!” Irwin wrote. “Not a great decade!”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Brittany Peterson)             LOS ANGELES (AP) — After weeks of windy and dry weather, rain has fallen in parched Southern California and is expected to aid firefighters who are mopping up multiple wildfires. But potentially heavy downpours on charred hillsides could bring new troubles such astoxic ash runoff. Los Angeles County crews spent much of the past week removing vegetation, shoring up slopes and reinforcing roads in devastated areas of thePalisades and Eaton fires, which reduced entire neighborhoods to rubble and ash after breaking out during powerful winds Jan. 7. Most of the region was forecast to get around an inch (about 2.5 centimeters) of precipitation over several days, but “the threat is high enough to prepare for the worst-case scenario” of localized cloudbursts causing mud and debris to flow down hills, the National Weather Service said on social media. “So the problem would be if one of those showers happens to park itself over a burn area,” weather service meteorologist Carol Smith said. “That could be enough to create debris flows.” Rainfall that began late Saturday was expected to increase Sunday and possibly last into early Tuesday, forecasters said. Flood watches were issued for some burn areas, while snow was likely in the mountains. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bassissued an executive order last weekto expedite cleanup efforts and mitigate the environmental impacts of fire-related pollutants. LA County supervisors also approved an emergency motion to install flood-control infrastructure and expedite and remove sediment in fire-impacted areas.  Fire crews filled sandbags for communities, while county workers installed barriers and cleared drainage pipes and basins. Officials cautioned that ash in recent burn zones wasa toxic mixof incinerated cars, electronics, batteries, building materials, paints, furniture and other household items. It contains pesticides, asbestos, plastics and lead. Residents were urged to wear protective gear while cleaning up. Concerns about post-fire debris flows have been especially high since 2018, when the town of Montecito, up the coast from LA, wasravaged by mudslidesafter a downpour hit mountain slopes burned bare by a huge blaze. Hundreds of homes were damaged and 23 people died. While the impending wet weather ended weeks of dangerous gusts and reduced humidity, several wildfires were still burning Saturday across Southern California. Those included the Palisades and Eaton fires, whichkilled at least 28 peopleand destroyed more than 14,000 structures. Containment of the Palisades Fire reached 81% on Saturday and the Eaton Fire was 95% contained. Smoke plumes rise from a hill Thursday, Jan. 23, 2025 in Camarillo, Calif., where the Laguna Fire fire broke out.

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)  In northern Los Angeles County, firefighters made significant progress against the Hughes Fire, which prompted evacuations for tens of thousands of people when it erupted on Wednesday in mountains near Lake Castaic. In San Diego County, there was still little containment of the Border 2 Fire as it burned through a remote area of the Otay Mountain Wilderness near the U.S.-Mexico border. The rain was expected to snap a near-record streak of dry weather for Southern California. Much of the region has received less than 5% of the average rainfall for this point in the water year, which began Oct. 1, the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday. Most of Southern California is currently in “extreme drought” or “severe drought,” according to theU.S. Drought Monitor.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Rain was falling across Southern California on Sunday, bringing some relief to thousands of firefighters battling multiplemajor blazesfor nearly a month in the Los Angeles area, but also prompting new threats of floods and mudslides across burn-scarred lands. A flood watch issued by the National Weather Service is to go into effect at 10 a.m. local time on Sunday for fire-ravaged areas of Los Angeles County, which has been ground zero for the historic firestorms that have leveled thousands of homes and killed at least 28 people since first igniting on Jan. 7. The flood watch will remain in effect until Monday afternoon in burn-scarred areas left by the Eaton, Palisades, Franklin, Bridge and Hughes fires. The rain is forecast to be widespread but is expected to be light enough to avoid major flooding. But if a downpour spends enough time over one of the recent burn scars, a debris flow could become an issue. Rain totals from the storm will mostly range from a half-inch to an inch, allowing for a decent soaking for the first time in months. Since June 1, Los Angeles has only picked up 0.03 inches of rainfall, which has allowed an extreme drought to develop across the area for the first time in two years. In addition to rain, higher elevations of Southern California, including the San Gabriel Mountains straddling northern Los Angeles and western San Bernardino counties, are expecting snow, with areas above 4,000 feet getting up to 14 inches of powder. The rain and snow forecast comes as firefighters continued to battle five active fires on Sunday from Ventura County north of Los Angeles to the Mexican border south of San Diego. The Palisades Fire, which ignited on Jan. 7 in Los Angeles County's Pacific Palisades, was 84% contained as of Sunday after burning more than 23,000 acres, destroying nearly 7,000 structures and killing 11 people, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). The Eaton Fire, which also broke out on Jan. 7 in Pasadena and Altadena, was 95% contained on Sunday after burning more than 14,000 acres, destroying more than 9,400 structures and killing 17 people. Other fires still active on Sunday, according to Cal Fire, include the Hughes Fire near Castaic Lake, about 45 miles north of downtown Los Angeles, which was 90% contained after starting on Wednesday and burning more than 10,000 acres of brush land; the Border 2 Fire that broke out Thursday near the San Diego-Mexico border and is 10% contained after burning more than 6,600 acres of wilderness land; and the Laguna Fire, which also started Thursday in Camarillo in Ventura County, which was 98% contained on Sunday after charring 83 acres and prompting a brief evacuation of the California State University Channel Islands. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Palestinian families have been displaced from the northern Gaza Strip since October 2023 when the Israel-Hamas war erupted. According to the ceasefire deal, the Israeli military had been expected to allow hundreds of thousands of Palestinian to return to northern Gaza through a road that bisects the territory starting Sunday. Israel has yet to allow Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza on foot through the so-called Netzarim corridor bisecting the territory, which extends from the Wadi Gaza river valley to Gaza City. It put the move on hold until Hamas freed a hostage who Israel said was supposed to have been released that day. (Production by Wafaa Shurafa) Israel has said that it needs to stay longer because the Lebanese army has not deployed to all areas of southern Lebanon to ensure that Hezbollah does not reestablish a military presence in the area. (AP Video shot by Bassam Al Masri)                                     DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel kept thousands of Palestinians from returning to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday as it accused Hamas of violatinga fragile ceasefireby changing the order of hostages it has released. Local health officials said Israeli forces fired on the crowd, killing two people and wounding nine. Israeli forcesalso opened fire in Lebanonon protesters demanding their withdrawal by Sunday’s deadline under a separate ceasefire with the Hezbollah militant group. Health officials in Lebanon said at least 22 people were killed and over 120 wounded. Israel says it hasn’t withdrawn because Lebanese forces are not deploying quickly enough, while Lebanon says its forces cannot move into areas until Israeli troops leave. U.S. President Donald Trump meanwhile suggested that most of Gaza’s populationbe at least temporarily resettled elsewhere, including in Egypt and Jordan, to “just clean out” the war-ravaged enclave. Jordan and the Palestinians swiftly rejected that, and Egypt has previously rejected the scenario, fearing Israelmight never allow refugees to return. Senior Hamas official Bassem Naim said Palestinians would never accept such a proposal, “even if seemingly well-intentioned under the guise of reconstruction.” He said the Palestinians can rebuild Gaza “even better than before”if Israel lifts its blockade. Under the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, Israel on Saturday was to begin allowing Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza throughthe Netzarim corridorbisecting the territory. Israel put that on hold until Hamas frees a civilian hostage who Israel said should have been released Saturday. Hamas accused Israel of violating the agreement.  Crowds of people carrying their belongings filled a main road leading to a closed Israeli checkpoint. “We have been in agony for a year and a half,” said Nadia Qasem. Fadi al-Sinwar, also displaced from Gaza City, said “the fate of more than a million people is linked to one person,” referring to the Israeli hostage, Arbel Yehoud. “See how valuable we are? We are worthless,” he said. Israeli forces fired on the crowds on three occasions overnight and into Sunday, killing two people and wounding nine, including a child, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. Israel’s military in a statement said it fired warning shots at “several gatherings of dozens of suspects who were advancing toward the troops and posed a threat to them.” Israel has pulled back from several areas of Gaza under the ceasefire, which came into effect last Sunday. The military has warned people to stay away from its forces, which still operate in a buffer zone inside Gaza along the border and in the Netzarim corridor. Hamasfreed four female Israeli soldierson Saturday, and Israel released some 200 Palestinian prisoners, most of whom were serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks. But Israel said Yehoud should have been released ahead of the soldiers. The release of four Israeli hostages Saturday comes nearly a week into a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and is part of a long and uncertain process aimed at eventually ending the war. The AP’s Sam Mednick explains. Israel also accused Hamas of failing to provide details on the conditions of hostages set to be freed in the remaining five weeks of the ceasefire’s first phase. In a statement, Hamas said it had told mediators — the United States, Egypt and Qatar — that Yehoud was alive and provided guarantees that she would be released. A spokesman for Gaza’s second-largest militant group, Islamic Jihad, later said the dispute over Yehoud had been settled. Mohamed al-Hajj Mousa said the group told mediators she will be released before Saturday. But an Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the behind-the-scenes talks, said there was still no deal. The ceasefire is aimed at ending the 15-month war triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack and freeing hostages still held in Gaza in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Around 90 hostages are still in Gaza, and Israeli authorities believe at least a third, and up to half, have died. Itzik Horn, the father of hostages Iair and Eitan Horn, called any resumption of fighting “a death sentence for the hostages” and criticized government ministers who want the war to go on. The ceasefire’s first phase runs until early March and includes the release of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The second — and far more difficult — phase, has yet to be negotiated. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining hostages without an end to the war, while Israel has threatened to resume its offensive until Hamas is destroyed. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 attack, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. More than 100 were freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the remains of dozens more, at least three of them mistakenly killed by Israeli forces. Seven have been freed in the latest ceasefire. Israel’s military campaign has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not say how many of the dead were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. Israeli bombardment and ground operationshave flattened wide swaths of Gazaand displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. Many who have returned home since the ceasefire began have found only mounds of rubble. Magdy reported from Cairo and Krauss from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)           DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — From activists on the far right toElon Musk, allies of PresidentDonald Trumphave been quick to threaten primary challengers for Republican senators who don’t back hisCabinet picksand legislative priorities. In the case of Iowa’s Joni Ernst, conservatives threatened to run against her if she didn’t backTrump’s pick for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth— before she announced she would. Louisiana’s Bill Cassidy, a doctor before entering politics, is being closely watched for how he will questionRobert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s nominee for health secretary South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham, a Trump confidant, has long been targeted by the far right in his state and was booed at a home-state rally during the 2024 presidential campaign. The Associated Press talked to people connected to five senators who have been targeted online or by rivals in their states. Here’s a look at each of their potential races and what they face: Ernst prompted criticism from the right after she initially stopped short of endorsing Hegseth, who wasconfirmed by the Senateon Friday. Ernst voted “yes.” A retired Iowa National Guard lieutenant colonel and Iraq War veteran, Ernst is also a sexual assault survivor. After Trump announced Hegseth’s nomination, she said she hoped to discuss with him comments that he had made opposing women serving in combat roles, and about an allegation, which he denied and was not charged for, that he sexually assaulted a woman he met at a 2017 conference.  Hegseth, at Ernst’s suggestion, affirmed that that “every man and woman has opportunity to serve their country in uniform and to do so at any level as long as they are meeting the standards that are set forward.” Hegseth also said that if confirmed, he would appoint a senior-level official dedicated to sexual assault prevention and response. Potential challengers to Ernst: Conservative media figure Steve Deace, who posted on Facebook in December that “I don’t want to be a Senator, but I am willing to primary her for the good of the cause.” Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird wrote in a December opinion piece in Breitbart that some unnamed “D.C. politicians” thought “they can ignore the voices of their constituents and entertain smears” from news media outlets. That prompted speculation that Bird, who endorsed Trump before the 2024 Iowa caucuses, might challenge Ernst, who stayed neutral beforehand. Charlie Kirk of the conservative group Turning Point also called for Ernst to face a primary. An effort to boost Hegseth’s nomination led to Ernst’s office receiving thousands of calls. Cause for concern: Neither Deace nor Bird has taken any public steps toward running. Some prominent social conservatives are bothered by Ernst’s joining with a dozen Republicans and the Senate’s Democratic majority in 2022 to support repealing the Defense of Marriage Act to recognize the validity of same-sex marriages. But she remains popular with Iowa’s power players. “Anyone who says with a straight face that they are going to beat Joni Ernst in a primary today is kidding themselves,” said Luke Martz, an Iowa Republican consultant. “It would be a fool’s errand.” Tillis angered some on the right for not immediately supporting Trump’s first pick for attorney general, former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz. Though Gaetz withdrew from consideration, Tillis remains a frustration to some among North Carolina’s right wing, in part for voting to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act. Potential challengers: Andy Nilsson, a onetime candidate for lieutenant governor, has filed paperwork to challenge Tillis. The retired businessman has called for a return to the Reagan-Bush Republican ethos, hardly an attack from the right. Tillis faced three Republican challengers in 2020, all posing as more conservative than him. Cause for concern: Tillis has reason to expect a right-wing challenge. That faction helped lift former Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson to the 2024 nomination for governor last year. But North Carolina is expected to be among the most competitive states for Senate Republicans to hold in 2026. Roy Cooper, a Democrat who just finished two terms as governor, has not ruled out running for the seat. National Republicans are aware of the risks of nominating someone too far to the right. Cooper’s Democratic successor, Gov. Josh Stein, beat Robinson by nearly 15 percentage points in a state that Trump won by 3 points. To that end, Trump’s team and Tillis have been working together behind the scenes, said former Gov. Pat McCrory, a fellow Republican. “I anticipate there will be threats of challenging him from the right. But I also think he’ll deal with it as he has, with hard work and a record of accomplishment,” McCrory said. “I think the incoming administration sees that.” “They also see he’s the best chance of keeping North Carolina red,” he added. Cassidy remains vulnerable in large part due to his vote to convict Trump after his second impeachment over the siege of the U.S. Capitol. “Our Constitution and our country is more important than any one person. I voted to convict President Trump because he is guilty,” Cassidy said in a statement after the February 2021 vote. Cassidy, in his second term, has not yet announced whether he will seek a third. A gastroenterologist before he entered politics, Cassidy will be closely watched for how he votes on Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic who has questioned medical consensus on several issues. Potential challengers: Cassidy has already drawn a Republican challenger, state Treasurer John Fleming. Fleming, a former U.S. House member from northern Louisiana, has said Cassidy’s impeachment vote “failed” Louisiana. Former U.S. Rep. Garrett Graves of Baton Rouge is also a potential challenger, as is Blake Miguez, a state senator from New Iberia. Louisiana last year did away with its 50-year tradition of “jungle primaries,” where candidates from all parties ran in the same contest in November. Cassidy would now run in a closed Republican primary that might be more difficult if he faces one strong Trump-aligned challenger. Cause for concern: Cassidy’s vote to convict Trump remains a sticking point for Republicans in a state the president won with 60% last year. But Cassidy is viewed as having strong constituent relations and visibility in the state, political observers say. “Aside from that vote, I think he’s considered a good senator, and good at constituent work,” said Ellen Carmichael, a Louisiana Republican consultant and president of Washington-based Lafayette Company. “The base is unhappy with the vote he cast. But I wouldn’t count him out.” Cornyn in the past has been criticized within his own party for being too willing to work with Democrats and has drawn boos at GOP conventions in Texas. Commentator Tucker Carlson and others have urged a primary challenge against him. Last year, Cornyn told the Dallas Morning News that, “God willing,” he would seek reelection in 2026. According to federal filings, Cornyn had more than $3.5 million on hand in toward the end of 2024. Potential challengers: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is one of the state’s most powerful Republicans and also suggested Cornyn should be primaried. Paxton was acquitted in a 2023 impeachment effort and fraud charges against him were dropped last year. Cornyn and Paxton have sniped at each other on X, with Paxton calling Cornyn “anti-Trump” and “anti-gun” and the senator firing back, “Hard to run from prison, Ken.” Cause for concern: Brendan Steinhauser, a Republican strategist who has worked on Cornyn’s previous campaigns, noted that the senator remains undefeated in elections. “He’s never taken a race for granted. I would expect him to work extremely hard and crisscross the state of Texas to earn every vote possible in this upcoming election, assuming he has a primary challenger,” Steinhauser said. “I think it’s important for him to show the ways that he has worked with President Trump to enact the conservative America First agenda, and I would expect that would be a big part of his campaign message in a potential upcoming primary.” Seeking his fifth term, Graham will likely face primary challenges — he always has. County-level Republican parties have censured him a number of times for his willingness to work on bipartisan deals. One such measure derided Graham’s “condescending attitude” to the party’s grassroots organizers. He has even drawn boos at some events of the party faithful in his home state. That includes aJuly 2023 Trump rallyin Pickens — in the county where Graham grew up — where objections from the crowd drowned out more than five minutes of his remarks. When he took the stage, Trump also elicited boos when he mentioned Graham’s name. Graham has named a campaign leadership team, which says he has more than $15 million on hand, including nearly $1 million raised in the final quarter of 2024. Potential challengers: Rep. Ralph Norman represents South Carolina’s 5th Congressional District south of Charlotte, North Carolina, and is a member of the House Freedom Caucus. Another possible opponent could be Adam Morgan, a former South Carolina legislator who lost a primary bid last year against another congressman, Rep. William Timmons. Cause for concern: While he was highly critical of Trump in 2016 when they competed for the Republican nomination, Graham has backed Trump ever since his first administration, frequently serving as his golf partner and Capitol Hill surrogate. Trump has backed him in turn. When the crowd in Pickens booed Graham’s name, Trump said he was “going to have to work on these people” and added that Graham is “there when you need him.” Kinnard reported from Washington.

        "content": "The FBI said a 21-year-old woman was arrested for fatally shooting the agent. An arrest has been made in thefatal shooting of a U.S. Border Patrol agentduring a traffic stop in Vermont, according to the FBI, as bizarre details of the suspects' movements beforehand have been revealed in the arrest affidavit. Teresa Youngblut, 21, of Washington state, was arrested on Friday and charged with assault on a federal law enforcement officer, according to a statement from the FBI. The affidavit unsealed by investigators reveals some new details about the movements of the two individuals who were involved in the fatal shooting of Border Patrol agent David Maland. Since Jan. 14, investigators had been conducting \"periodic surveillance\" on Youngblut and Felix Baukholt, a German national who was killed during the shooting, after they were reported as suspicious by someone who was staying at the same hotel as the pair, according to court records. \"An employee of a hotel in Lyndonville, Vermont contacted law enforcement after a male and a female had checked into the hotel to report concerns about them, including that they appeared to be dressed in all-black tactical style clothing with protective equipment, with the woman, later identified as Youngblut, carrying an apparent firearm in an exposed-carry holster,\" according to charges unsealed in Vermont federal court on Friday. Agents from the Vermont State Police and Homeland Security Investigations attempted to approach the pair for a voluntary interview, but they rebuffed law enforcement, \"claiming that they were in the vicinity to look at purchasing property,\" according to the court records. Five days later, the pair were spotted in downtown Newport, Vermont, in \"similar tactical dress\" and carrying a handgun, which is permitted in Vermont, the affidavit said. On Monday, the day of the fatal shooting, the two were being observed by law enforcement in the parking lot of a Walmart nearby, prosecutors said. Investigators observed Baukholt come out of the store with rolls of aluminum foil that he then used to wrap cellphones, they said. The stop was initiated by Border Patrol agents under the pretext of an immigration violation, according to the court records. Between 3 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. agents reported gunshots from the scene, according to the affidavit. Agents described to their supervisor \"that both Baukholt and Youngblut possessed firearms and that Youngblut drew and fired a handgun toward at least one of the uniformed Border Patrol agents without warning when outside the driver's side of the Prius. Baukholt then attempted to draw a firearm. At least one Border Patrol agent fired at Youngblut and Baukholt with his service weapon,\" according to the affidavit. Upon searching the vehicle, agents found a cache of weapons and tactical gear, as well as the cellphones wrapped in foil. The agents have not been interviewed according to the complaint, officials said. \"Agent Maland bravely served his country as a member of the U.S. Air Force,\" said Special Agent in Charge Craig Tremaroli of the FBI Albany Field Office in a statement. \"He continued that service when he answered the call to protect and serve as a law enforcement officer, making him a shining example of service over self. This arrest proves the FBI, together with our partners, will work diligently to ensure any individual who uses a firearm to assault such a public servant will be brought to justice.\" ABC News' Alex Faul contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)                       MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) —Alexander Zverevdescribed himself as “quite down” and “quite emotional” after once again coming within one win of earning his first Grand Slam title. And unlike his first two defeats in major finals — both of which he led, and both of which went five sets — Zverev did not come close to reaching the finish line Sunday in the Australian Open final, which ended with defending championJannik Sinner holding the trophy after his 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 victory. “I’m doing everything I can. I’m working as hard as I ever did. I think I’m doing all the right things off-court. I think I’m practicing the right things. But I lost in straight sets today. I mean, those are facts. That is a fact. I lost to Jannik in straight sets today,” said Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany who is ranked No. 2 but did not seem anywhere near No. 1 Sinner on this occasion. “I mean, I don’t want to end my career as the best player of all time to never win a Grand Slam, that’s for sure,” said Zverev, whosepost-match speech was interruptedby someone in Rod Laver Arena calling out the names of two women who haveaccused him of physical abusein the past. “I’ll keep doing everything I can,” Zverev said, “to lift one of those trophies.” He is the seventh man in the Open era, which dates to 1968, to start a career with an 0-3 record in title matches at one of the sport’s four most important events.  Five of the other six went on to win at least one major championship. The only member of the group who hasn’t is Casper Ruud, who is also the only one still active. Sinner offered support to Zverev during the trophy ceremony Sunday. That came in the form of an arm around the shoulder — and with his words. “Keep believing in yourself,” Sinner told Zverev. “Keep working hard, because we all believe that you can lift one of these very, very soon.” Simone Vagnozzi, one of Sinner’s coaches, said about Zverev: “I really hope, sooner or later, he wins a Slam, because he deserves it.” Zverev’s previous trips to the brink of achieving what he very badly wants came at the2020 U.S. Open, where he built a two-set lead and even held a match point against Dominic Thiem before faltering, and at the2024 French Open, where he led Carlos Alcaraz two sets to one before letting that slip away. This one never got to that sort of stage, and Zverev frequently showed his frustration by cracking rackets The nearest Zverev came to really making it close was when he was two points from taking the second set. But Sinner took the next four points and that, basically, was that. “That was a massive point. I think whoever wins that set, kind of can get a little bit of momentum. Being down two sets to love, especially, then his confidence goes up, mine goes down. It’s a long way back then against someone like Jannik,” Zverev said. “If it’s one set all, maybe I have a chance. But ... I didn’t stop fighting. I didn’t stop believing. Then, in the third set, I thought he outplayed me more than in the other sets.” More AP tennis:https://apnews.com/hub/tennis   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

We're going to try to be efficient, but with more money we have, the more we can accomplish.\" Immigration and Customs Enforcement doesn’t currently have enough funding from Congress to detain all of the undocumented immigrants that the Trump administration says it hopes to arrest, Homan said, so the scope of its enforcement operations is dependent on the scope of funding from Congress. \"The more money, the better I’m going to do,\" he said. Watch more of Martha Raddatz's interview with Tom Homan Sunday on ABC's 'This Week' Homan said success comes down to this: \"Take as many public safety threats off the street as possible.\" That includes deporting \"every illegal alien gang member in this country, including Tren de Agua,\" the Venezuelan cartel, he added. \"When we see the crime rate from illegal aliens go down, that's success,\" he said. \"Every public safety threat removed [from] this country is success. Every national security [threat] we find and remove from the country is a success.\" In the interview airing Sunday, Homan said the U.S. government for the first time ever used military aircraft to transport migrants back to their home country, and it will now be a daily occurrence. According to U.S. officials, the U.S. military on Thursday flew more than 150 migrants to Guatemala on two separate flights. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

A teenager who opened fire with a 9 mm pistolin his Nashville high school cafeteriafired a total of 10 shots within 17 seconds of entering the room, according to police. Solomon Henderson, 17, had gone into a bathroom and posted photos to social media just before he went to the cafeteria and opened fire, police said. Henderson shot and killed 16-year-old Josselin Corea Escalante and shot and wounded a 17-year-old boy at Antioch High School around 11 a.m. Wednesday, according to police. Henderson died in the cafeteria from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, police said. The injured boy suffered a graze wound and was treated and released, police said. Authorities are still investigating how Henderson obtained the pistol, Nashville police said Thursday. The gun was purchased in Arizona in 2022 and was not reported stolen, police said. No firearms or firearm parts were found during Wednesday's search of Henderson's home, according to authorities. Authorities are now scouring Henderson's writings and social media presence as they investigate his ideological influences. A Pinterest account linked to Henderson features photos of past school shooters, including the shooters from Parkland, Florida, and Uvalde, Texas, a source told ABC News. Henderson's social media presence also shows he may have been in contact with 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow, whocarried out a shooting at the Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin,last month, according to law enforcement sources. Rupnow, who went by Samantha, also died after the shooting, in which two were killed and several wounded. Rupnow's account may have been following Henderson's account at the time of the Wisconsin shooting in December, according to law enforcement sources. It appears Henderson had two documents on \"non-traditional websites, one 51 pages in length, the other 288 pages,\" police said. The 51-page document expressed violent white supremacist beliefs, sources told ABC News. He expressed self-hatred as a Black person, and he wrote of wishing violence on other Black people. He also expressed violent hatred toward Jews and used antisemitic tropes and conspiracy theories to express his views, according to the sources. Henderson appeared to support neo-Nazi accelerationist and violent incel beliefs and expressed a desire to see genocide committed against racial and religious minorities, according to sources. He belonged to online communities that promote violence and extremism, sources said, and some people in those groups publicly identified Henderson as the school shooter long before his identity was confirmed by authorities.

(AP Photo/Brittany Peterson)             LOS ANGELES (AP) — After weeks of windy and dry weather, rain has fallen in parched Southern California and is expected to aid firefighters who are mopping up multiple wildfires. But potentially heavy downpours on charred hillsides could bring new troubles such astoxic ash runoff. Los Angeles County crews spent much of the past week removing vegetation, shoring up slopes and reinforcing roads in devastated areas of thePalisades and Eaton fires, which reduced entire neighborhoods to rubble and ash after breaking out during powerful winds Jan. 7. Most of the region was forecast to get around an inch (about 2.5 centimeters) of precipitation over several days, but “the threat is high enough to prepare for the worst-case scenario” of localized cloudbursts causing mud and debris to flow down hills, the National Weather Service said on social media. “So the problem would be if one of those showers happens to park itself over a burn area,” weather service meteorologist Carol Smith said. “That could be enough to create debris flows.” Rainfall that began late Saturday was expected to increase Sunday and possibly last into early Tuesday, forecasters said. Flood watches were issued for some burn areas, while snow was likely in the mountains. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bassissued an executive order last weekto expedite cleanup efforts and mitigate the environmental impacts of fire-related pollutants. LA County supervisors also approved an emergency motion to install flood-control infrastructure and expedite and remove sediment in fire-impacted areas.  Fire crews filled sandbags for communities, while county workers installed barriers and cleared drainage pipes and basins. Officials cautioned that ash in recent burn zones wasa toxic mixof incinerated cars, electronics, batteries, building materials, paints, furniture and other household items. It contains pesticides, asbestos, plastics and lead. Residents were urged to wear protective gear while cleaning up. Concerns about post-fire debris flows have been especially high since 2018, when the town of Montecito, up the coast from LA, wasravaged by mudslidesafter a downpour hit mountain slopes burned bare by a huge blaze. Hundreds of homes were damaged and 23 people died. While the impending wet weather ended weeks of dangerous gusts and reduced humidity, several wildfires were still burning Saturday across Southern California. Those included the Palisades and Eaton fires, whichkilled at least 28 peopleand destroyed more than 14,000 structures. Containment of the Palisades Fire reached 81% on Saturday and the Eaton Fire was 95% contained.

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)  In northern Los Angeles County, firefighters made significant progress against the Hughes Fire, which prompted evacuations for tens of thousands of people when it erupted on Wednesday in mountains near Lake Castaic. In San Diego County, there was still little containment of the Border 2 Fire as it burned through a remote area of the Otay Mountain Wilderness near the U.S.-Mexico border. The rain was expected to snap a near-record streak of dry weather for Southern California. Much of the region has received less than 5% of the average rainfall for this point in the water year, which began Oct. 1, the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday. Most of Southern California is currently in “extreme drought” or “severe drought,” according to theU.S. Drought Monitor.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

President Donald Trump took a victory lap at a Las Vegas casino on Saturday after a five days of issuing executive orders on immigration, the economy, DEI and more. Trump late Friday night stirred up outrage when he blindsided at least 17 inspectors general at multiple federal agencies by firing them in an email from the White House personnel office. Meanwhile, two more of Trump's picks for his Cabinet -- Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense and Kristi Noem as secretary of Homeland Security -- were sworn in to office on Saturday. In a post on X thus morning, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that Belarus “just unilaterally released an innocent American, ANASTASSIA Nuhfer, who was taken under JOE BIDEN!” Rubio credited Trump and Chris Welby Smith, the State Department’s deputy assistant secretary for Eastern Europe, for the release.   Nuhfer was detained in early December 2024 and visited by a consular officer about three weeks ago, a State Department spokesperson said. -ABC News' Shannon Kingston Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, the top Trump appointee in the Justice Department, is currently in Chicago to “personally observe DHS immigration enforcement operations and support the efforts of FBI, DEA, ATF, USMS, and federal prosecutors who are assisting DHS in this critical mission,” a DOJ spokesperson told ABC News. The department declined to provide any additional details about Bove’s precise location or the planned “enforcement operations” he will be overseeing.   His presence on the ground, however, further highlights how the Trump administration plans to involve the highest level officials at DOJ as part of its broader show of force on immigration enforcement. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement said in a statement Sunday that it, \"along with federal partners, including the FBI, ATF, DEA, CBP and the U.S. Marshals Service, began conducting enhanced targeted operations today in Chicago to enforce U.S. immigration law and preserve public safety and national security by keeping potentially dangerous criminal aliens out of our communities.\" -ABC News' Alexander Mallin The Coast Guard said it's helping transport migrants who are in the country illegally and who are in locations where there aren't Defense Department assets. In a Saturday news release, the Coast Guard said it is conducting flights between Texas and California to get migrants to DOD bases to be removed from the country.   \"Border czar\" Tom Homan said the Trump administration isplanning to use military aircraftevery day to help carry out large-scale deportations. For the first time ever, the U.S. government is using military aircraft to transport migrants out of the U.S., Homan said. -ABC News' Luke Barr Kristi Noem was sworn in as secretary of Homeland Security Saturday afternoon.

        "content": "The FBI said a 21-year-old woman was arrested for fatally shooting the agent. An arrest has been made in thefatal shooting of a U.S. Border Patrol agentduring a traffic stop in Vermont, according to the FBI, as bizarre details of the suspects' movements beforehand have been revealed in the arrest affidavit. Teresa Youngblut, 21, of Washington state, was arrested on Friday and charged with assault on a federal law enforcement officer, according to a statement from the FBI. The affidavit unsealed by investigators reveals some new details about the movements of the two individuals who were involved in the fatal shooting of Border Patrol agent David Maland. Since Jan. 14, investigators had been conducting \"periodic surveillance\" on Youngblut and Felix Baukholt, a German national who was killed during the shooting, after they were reported as suspicious by someone who was staying at the same hotel as the pair, according to court records. \"An employee of a hotel in Lyndonville, Vermont contacted law enforcement after a male and a female had checked into the hotel to report concerns about them, including that they appeared to be dressed in all-black tactical style clothing with protective equipment, with the woman, later identified as Youngblut, carrying an apparent firearm in an exposed-carry holster,\" according to charges unsealed in Vermont federal court on Friday. Agents from the Vermont State Police and Homeland Security Investigations attempted to approach the pair for a voluntary interview, but they rebuffed law enforcement, \"claiming that they were in the vicinity to look at purchasing property,\" according to the court records. Five days later, the pair were spotted in downtown Newport, Vermont, in \"similar tactical dress\" and carrying a handgun, which is permitted in Vermont, the affidavit said. On Monday, the day of the fatal shooting, the two were being observed by law enforcement in the parking lot of a Walmart nearby, prosecutors said. Investigators observed Baukholt come out of the store with rolls of aluminum foil that he then used to wrap cellphones, they said. The stop was initiated by Border Patrol agents under the pretext of an immigration violation, according to the court records. Between 3 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. agents reported gunshots from the scene, according to the affidavit. Agents described to their supervisor \"that both Baukholt and Youngblut possessed firearms and that Youngblut drew and fired a handgun toward at least one of the uniformed Border Patrol agents without warning when outside the driver's side of the Prius. Baukholt then attempted to draw a firearm. At least one Border Patrol agent fired at Youngblut and Baukholt with his service weapon,\" according to the affidavit. Upon searching the vehicle, agents found a cache of weapons and tactical gear, as well as the cellphones wrapped in foil. The agents have not been interviewed according to the complaint, officials said. \"Agent Maland bravely served his country as a member of the U.S. Air Force,\" said Special Agent in Charge Craig Tremaroli of the FBI Albany Field Office in a statement. \"He continued that service when he answered the call to protect and serve as a law enforcement officer, making him a shining example of service over self. This arrest proves the FBI, together with our partners, will work diligently to ensure any individual who uses a firearm to assault such a public servant will be brought to justice.\" ABC News' Alex Faul contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(Neon via AP)         NEW YORK (AP) — Critics lambasted it and audiences didn’t grade it much better. But despite the turbulence,Mel Gibson’s “Flight Risk”managed to open No. 1 at the box office with a modest $12 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. On a quiet weekend, even for the typically frigid movie-going month of January, the top spot went to the Lionsgate thriller starring Mark Wahlberg as a pilot flying an Air Marshal (Michelle Dockery) and fugitive (Topher Grace) across Alaska. But it wasn’t a particularly triumphant result for Gibson’s directorial follow-up to 2016’s“Hacksaw Ridge.”Reviews (21% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores (a “C” CinemaScore) were terrible. President Donald Trumprecentlynamed Gibson a “special ambassador”to Hollywood, along with Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone. Going into the weekend, Hollywood’s attention was more focused on theSundance Film Festivaland on Thursday’sOscar nominations, which were twice postponed by thewildfires in the Los Angeles region. The weekend was also a small test as to whether the once more common Oscar “bump” that can sometimes follow nominations still exists. Most contenders have by now completed the bulk of their theatrical runs and are more likely to see an uptick on VOD or streaming. But the weekend’s most daring gambit was A24 pushingBrady Corbet’s “The Brutalist”a three–and-a-half-hour epic nominated for 10 Academy Awards, into wide release. Though some executives initially greeted “The Brutalist,” which is running with an intermission, as “un-distributable,” Corbet has said, A24 acquired the film out of the Venice Film Festival and it’s managed solid business, collecting $6 million in limited release.  In wide release, it earned $2.9 million — a far from blockbuster sum but the best weekend yet for “The Brutalist.” The audience was downright miniscule for another best-picture nominee: RaMell Ross’“Nickel Boys.”Innovatively shot almost entirely in first-person POV, the Amazon MGM Studios release gathered just $340,171 in 540 locations after expanding by 300 theaters. Coming offone of the lowest Martin Luther King Jr. weekends in years, no new releases made a major impact. Steven Soderbergh’s “Presence,”a well-reviewed horror film shot from the perspective of a ghost inside a suburban home, debuted with $3.4 million in 1,750 locations. The film, released by Neon and acquired out of last year’s Sundance, was made for just $2 million. The top spots otherwise went to holdovers. The Walt Disney Co.’s“Mufasa: The Lion King,”in its sixth weekend of release, scored $8.7 million to hold second place. After starting slow, the Barry Jenkins-directed film has amassed $626.7 million globally. “One of Them Days,”the Keke Palmer and SZA led comedy from Sony Pictures, held well in its second weekend, dropping just 32% with $8 million in ticket sales. In recent years, few comedies have found success on the big screen, but “One of Them Days” has proven an exception. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. “Flight Risk,” $12 million. 2. “Mufasa: The Lion King,” $8.7 million. 3. “One of Them Days,” $8 million. 4. “Sonic the Hedgehog 3,” $5.5 million. 5. “Moana 2,” $4.3 million. 6. “Presence,” $3.4 million. 7. “Wolf Man,” $3.4 million. 8. “A Complete Unknown,” $3.1 million. 9. “Den of Thieves 2: Pantera,” $3 million. 10. “The Brutalist,” $2.9 million.

(AP Photo/Ben Curtis)           WASHINGTON (AP) —President Donald Trump’sfirst week in office isn’t over yet, but already itoffers signalsabout how his next four years in the White House may unfold. Some takeaways from the earliest days of his second term: Within hours of being sworn in, Trumppardoned more than 1,500people who were convicted or charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by his supporters. Those pardonedinclude people who attacked, bloodied and beat police officers that day. The Republican president’s decision was at odds with earlier comments by his incoming vice president, JD Vance, and other senior aides that Trump would only let off those who weren’t violent. The pardons were the first of many moves he made in his first week to reward allies and punish critics, in both significant and subtle ways. It signaled that without the need to worry about reelection — the Constitution bars a third term — or legal consequences after the Supreme Court granted presidents expansive immunity, the new president, backed by a Republican Congress, has little to restrain him. Trump ended protective security details forDr. Anthony Fauci, his former COVID-19 adviser, along with former national security adviser John Bolton, formerSecretary of State Mike Pompeoand his onetime deputy. The security protections had been regularly extended by the Biden administration over credible threats to the men’s lives. Trump alsorevokedthe security clearances of dozens of former government officials who had criticized him, including Bolton, and directed that the portrait of a former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, retired Gen. Mark Milley be removed from the Pentagon walls.  In his first days in office, Trump demonstrated just how much he and his team had learned from four often-chaotic years in the White House and four more in political exile. A president’s most valuable resource is time and Trump set out in his first hours to make his mark on the nation with executive orders, policy memoranda and government staffing shake-ups. It reflected a level of sophistication that eluded him in his first term and surpassed his Democratic predecessors in its scale and scope for their opening days in the Oval Office. Feeling burned by the holdover of Obama administration appointees during his first go-around, Trumpswiftly exiledBiden holdovers and moved to test new hires for their fealty to his agenda. In a matter of days heuprooted four yearsof diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the federal government, sent federal troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and erased Biden’s guardrails on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency development. In his first term, Trump’s early executive orders were more showpieces than substance and frequently were blocked by federal courts. This time, Trump is still confronting the limits of his constitutional authorities, but is also far more adept at controlling what is within them. An hour after concluding a relatively sedate inaugural address in the Capitol Rotunda, Trump decided to let loose. Speaking to an overflow crowd of governors, political supports and dignitaries in the Capitol Visitor Center’s Emancipation Hall, Trump ripped in to Biden, the Justice Department and other perceived rivals. He followed it up with an even longer speech to supporters at a downtown arena and in more than 50 minutes of remarks and questions and answers with reporters in the Oval Office. For all of Trump’s experience and organization, he is still very much the same Donald Trump, and just as intent as before on dominating the center of the national conversation. If not more. He has acted to try to end civil service protections for many federal workers andoverturn more than a century of lawon birthright citizenship. Such moves have been a magnet for legal challenges. In the case of the birthright citizenship order, it met swift criticism from U.S. District Judge John Coughenour, who put a temporary stay on Trump’s plans. “I’ve been on the bench for over four decades. I can’t remember another case where the question presented was as clear as this one is,” Coughenour, who was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan, told a Justice Department attorney. “This is a blatantly unconstitutional order.” How those court cases play out will determine not only the fate of some of Trump’s most controversial actions, but just how far any president can go in pushing an agenda. The president likes to call it “liquid gold.” His main economic assumption is that more oil production by the United States, the Saudis and the rest of OPEC would bring down prices. That would reduce overall inflation and cut down on the oil revenues that Russia is using to fund its war in Ukraine. For Trump, oil is the answer. He’s betting that fossil fuels are the future, despite the climate change risks. “The United States has the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth, and we’re going to use it,” Trump said in a Thursday speech. “Not only will this reduce the cost of virtually all goods and services, it’ll make the United States a manufacturing superpower and the world capital of artificial intelligence and crypto” Trump had theworld’s wealthiest menbehind him on the dais when he took the oath of office on Monday. Tesla’s Elon Musk, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and LVMH’s Bernard Arnault were all there. SoftBank billionaire Masayoshi Son was in the audience. Later in the week, Oracle’s Larry Ellison and OpenAI’s Sam Altman appeared with Son at the White House to announce an artificial intelligence investment of up to $500 billion. Musk, the Trump backer who is leading the president’s Department of Government Efficiency effort, posted on X that SoftBank didn’t have the money. Altman, a rival to to Musk on AI, responded over X that the funding was there. By surrounding himself with the wealthiest people in tech, Trump is also stuck in their drama. “The people in the deal are very, very smart people,” Trump said Thursday. “But Elon, one of the people, he happens to hate. But I have certain hatreds of people, too.” America’s 25th president has a big fan in Trump. Trump likes the tariffs that were imposed during Republican William McKinley’s presidency and helped to fund the government. Trump has claimed the country was its wealthiest in the 1890s when McKinley was in office. But McKinley might not be a great economic role model for the 21st century. For starters, the Tax Foundation found that federal receipts were equal to just 3% of the overall economy in 1900, McKinley’s reelection year. Tax revenues are now equal to about 17% of the U.S. economy and that’s still not enough to fund the government without running massive deficits. So it would be hard to go full McKinley without some chaos. As Dartmouth College economist Douglas Irwin noted on X, the economic era defined by McKinley was not that great for many people. “There was a little something called the Panic of 1893 and the unemployment rate was in double digits from 1894-98!!” Irwin wrote. “Not a great decade!”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

        "content": "Palestinians face challenges of rebuilding lives torn apart by Gaza war. Gaza has become a wasteland of ruins and rubble due to Israel's conflict with Hamas following the terror organization's surprise attack on Oct. 7, 2023. However, now that a ceasefire is in place, families are returning to their neighborhoods, hoping to rebuild the places they once called home. One of the families excited to be back is the Ghaly family. After leaving the tents they had lived in for months, they are taking the few possessions they still have. As they returned to see the rubble, evidence of the destructive force where no building was left untouched, they also saw their family home. \"This is our four-story home,\" Eyad Abu Ghaly said. \"It has been completely flattened, and there was no reason for that. We don’t understand why the house was bombed.\" Eyad further explains, “The resistance does not exist here — just civilians.” Many homes that are still standing are wrecked inside, and as people wonder how they will ever rebuild, there’s also fear that war will soon return. \"I look at young people and wonder, 'Where will they go?'\" Ghaly said. \"There’s no future for them — no education, no health care. There is no life, no life at all.\" The agreement between Hamas and Israel, which ended the fighting and resulted in three Israeli hostages being freed on Sunday and reuniting with their families, was initially based on a six-week ceasefire. On Inauguration Day, President Donald Trump stated he was not confident that a second phase of the deal could be reached to prolong the truce and free all remaining hostages, both living and deceased. Tal Haimi was killed in the Oct. 7 massacre, but his body was taken into Gaza by Hamas. His cousin, Udi Goren, said that if Israel prioritizes the release of all hostages, it will further weaken Hamas. \"It is in our interest,\" Goren said. \"Bring back the hostages because that's more valuable to Hamas than anything else. And once we have the hostages back home, then we need to keep doing what we're actually doing right now, collaborating with the mediators in creating a different future for Gaza, where Hamas is not a part of it.\" But as soon as the ceasefire kicked in in Gaza, Hamas gunmen were parading through the streets. Then, the hostage handover was used to show they were back in charge. With no sign that Hamas is willing to capitulate, a former Israeli general close to the Israeli government states that it is unlikely the six-week ceasefire will be prolonged. Retired Israel Defense Forces Brigadier General Amir Avivi told ABC News that Israel is discussing a second deal. Yet this deal involves not just the release of hostages, but also requires Hamas to surrender, relinquish its control over Gaza, and vacate the area. \"And we will have to pressure and continue degrading Hamas capabilities to an extent where they will understand that it's game over,\" Avivi said. While teams in Gaza search the rubble for more bodies, there is no clear sense of who or what could govern Gaza if Hamas were to be removed. According to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, the war has already claimed 47,000 lives. Some 1,200 were killed in southern Israel during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, according to Israeli officials. In examining Gaza before the war and observing the devastation now, aid agencies warn that thousands more dead have not yet been counted or found. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)                                                       MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — There’s all sorts of ways beyond merely the score to measure just how dominantJannik Sinnerwas while outplaying and frustratingAlexander Zverevduring the 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 victory Sunday that earned the 23-year-old Italian a second consecutiveAustralian Openchampionship.  The zero break points Sinner faced. Or the 10 he accumulated. The 27-13 advantage in points that lasted at least nine strokes. Or the way Sinner accumulated more winners, 32 to 25, and fewer unforced errors, 27 to 45. The way Sinner won 10 of the 13 points that ended with him at the net. Or the way he only let Zverev go 14 of 27 in that category, frequently zipping passing shots out of reach.  Well, here’s is one more bit of evidence: what Zverev said about Sinner.  “I’m serving better than him, but that’s it. He does everything else better than me. He moves better than me. He hits his forehand better than me. He hits his backhand better than me. He returns better than me. He volleys better than me,” Zverev said. “At the end of the day, tennis has five or six massive shots — like, massive factors — and he does four or five of them better than me. That’s the reason why he won.”  High praise from a guy who is, after all, ranked No. 2. Sinner has held the No. 1 spot since last June andis not showing any signs of relinquishing it. This was the first Australian Open final between the men at No. 1 and No. 2 since 2019, whenNo. 1 Novak Djokovic defeated No. 2 Rafael Nadal— also in straight sets.  “It’s amazing,” Sinner said, “to achieve these things.”   The “things” include being the youngest man to leave Melbourne Park with the trophy two years in a row since Jim Courier in 1992-93, and the first man sinceNadalat the French Open in 2005 and 2006 to follow up his firstGrand Slamtitle by repeating as the champion at the same tournament a year later.

(AP Photo/Manish Swarup)   Sinner was asked later whether he felt more relief or excitement when he raised his arms after the last point was his.  “This one was joy. We managed to do something incredible this time, because the situation I was in was completely different from a year ago here,” he said. “I had more pressure.”  Probably true, but’s hard to tell.  Go to the start of 2024, and take stock. In that span, Sinner has won three of the five major tournaments, including the U.S. Open in September, meaning he now has claimed three straight hard-court Slams. His record is 80-6 with nine titles. His current unbeaten run covers 21 matches.  “There’s always something that can get better,” said one of his two coaches, Simone Vagnozzi. “He is playing really well right now and everything comes easily. But there will be tough moments ahead.”  The only thing that’s clouded the past 12 months for Sinner, it seems,is the doping casein which his exoneration was appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency. He tested positive for a trace amount of an anabolic steroid twice last March but blamed it on an accidental exposure involving two members of his team who have since been fired. Sinner initially was cleared in August; ahearing in the WADA appealis scheduled for April.  “I keep playing like this because I have a clear mind on what happened,” Sinner said Sunday. “I know if I would be guilty, I would not play like this.”  While he became the eighth man in the Open era (which began in 1968) to start his career 3-0 in Grand Slam finals,Zverev is the seventh to be 0-3, adding this loss to those at the 2020 U.S. Open and last year’s French Open.  Those earlier setbacks both came in five sets. This contest was not that close. Not at all.  “I’ll keep doing everything I can,” Zverev said, “to lift one of those trophies.”  Just beforeZverev began speakinginto a microphone during the trophy ceremony, a voice cried out from the stands, making reference to two of the player’s ex-girlfriends whoaccused him of physical abuse.  During the match, there truly was only one moment that contained a hint of tension. It came when Zverev was two points from owning the second set at 5-4, love-30. But a break point — and a set point — never arrived.  A year ago, Sinner went through a lot more trouble to earn his first major, needing to get past Novak Djokovic —who quit one set into his semifinalagainst Zverev on Friday because of a torn hamstring — beforeerasing a two-set deficit in the finalagainst 2021 U.S. Open champion Daniil Medvedev.  This time, Sinner applied pressure with an all-around style that does not really appear to have holes.  He proved superior in every meaningful way other than aces, leaving Zverev shaking his head or trudging to the sideline with shoulders sagging or cracking his racket against the court or against another racket.  Perfectly understandable, given what Sinner can do to an opponent, especially on a hard court.  “The facts speak for themselves,” Zverev said. “He’s in a different universe right now.”   Howard Fendrich has been the AP’s tennis writer since 2002.

Huh) LOS ANGELES (AP) — The latest evidence that homeownership is becoming increasingly less accessible to many Americans: Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last year to a nearly 30-year low for the second time in as many years. Elevated mortgage rates, a yearslong shortage of homes on the market andrecord-high home pricescontinued to stymie prospective home shoppers, especially first-time buyers. That led existing home sales to fall 0.7% last year to 4.06 million — the weakest showing for home sales since 1995 and edging out the terrible year for sales in 2023, the National Association of Realtors said Friday. Even in the midst of a sales slump, a dearth of homes on the market and rising mortgage rates gave sellers an edge over buyers, helping drive up the national median home price for all of last year to an all-time high $407,500, an increase of 4.7% from a year earlier. “How is it possible that home sales can be this low, considering that the U.S. population has increased by more than 70 million over this time period from 1995 to today?” asked Lawrence Yun, the NAR’s chief economist. “One can partly answer that question because of the affordability issue. Record-high home prices, mortgage rates having risen, but also lack of inventory.” The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump dating back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage surged to a 23-year high of nearly 8% in October 2023 and briefly fell to a 2-year low last September, but has beenmostly hovering around 7%,according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac.  The buying power of Americans now facing higher costs to borrow money for homes that have soared in value has been significantly stunted. With so few homes up for sale, millions of would-be homebuyers have found themselves on the sidelines. At the end of December, there were just 1.15 million homes on the market, NAR said. While that was up 16.2% from a year earlier, the inventory remained well below the annual historical average of about 1.98 million, according to data going back to 1999. The available inventory at the end of last month amounts to a 3.3-month supply, going by the current sales pace. In a more balanced market between buyers and sellers, there is a 4- to 6-month supply. “This means that the problems in the U.S. housing market continue to worsen in terms of availability of homes for sale and the upward pressure on home prices,” Eugenio Aleman, chief economist at Raymond James, wrote in a research note. Many factors have contributed to the housing shortage, including more than a decade of below-average new home construction and homeowners hanging on to their properties longer. And while President Donald Trump made increasing the housing supply one of his election campaign platforms, there are no quick fixes. “Over the past decade, the U.S. has averaged about 5.2 million home sales annually,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS. “It is going to take years before we are back at that level, maybe not even until the 2030s. The lack of inventory is the key constraint.” A sharp drop in the mortgage rate boosted the purchasing power of Americans in 2020 and 2021. While many economists predict that the average rate on a 30-year mortgage will ease this year, they generally don’t expect it to fall below 6%, about twice what it was five years ago. When mortgage rates ease, they can encourage home shoppers. A pullback in rates last fall helped home sales increase on a monthly basis in the last three months of the year. Home sales in December rose 2.2% from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis to a 4.24 million annual pace, NAR said. That topped the 4.2 million pace forecast by analysts polled by FactSet. Sales rose 9.3% in December versus the same month last year. The median home sales price rose for the 18th consecutive month in December to $404,000, up 6% from a year earlier. Limited inventory, especially in the more affordable price range of a given market, helps drive prices higher. That’s one reason many first-time homebuyers, who don’t have any home equity to put toward their down payment, continue to struggle. They accounted for 31% of all homes sold last month, up from 30% in November and 29% in December 2023. However, the annual share of first-time buyers was 24%. It’s been 40% historically.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)         WASHINGTON (AP) — Two months ago, in his first network television interview after the election,Donald Trumpsaid he owed his victory to Americans’ anger over immigration and inflation, specifically the rising cost of groceries. “When you buy apples, when you buy bacon, when you buy eggs, they would double and triple the price over a short period of time,” he told NBC’s “Meet the Press. “And I won an election based on that. We’re going to bring those prices way down.” But in Trump’s first week back in the White House, there was little in his initial blitz ofexecutive ordersthat directly tackled those prices, besides directing federal agencies to start“pursuing appropriate actions.”He is taking steps to lower energy costs, something that Trump hopes will have ripple effects throughout the economy. Otherwise, his focus has been clamping down on immigration, which he described as his “No. 1 issue” shortly after taking the oath of office. “They all said inflation was the No. 1 issue. I said, ‘I disagree,’” Trump said. “I talked about inflation too, but how many times can you say that an apple has doubled in cost?” Trump is banking on voters giving him a pass andcontinuing to blame former President Joe Bidenfor high prices. The Republican’s comments reflect the reality that presidents have almost no levers to reduce inflation quickly without causing collateral damage to other parts of the economy.  There is more that Trump can do on energy. He is pushing to reduce regulations andincrease the amount of landavailable for drilling. He is trying to persuade domestic and foreign oil producers to potentially sacrifice their own profitsby pumping more. During a rally Saturday in Las Vegas, Trump went after his Democratic predecessor for allowing prices to rise under his watch, and promised to take care of the problem quickly. “When I think of Biden, I think of incompetence and inflation,” Trump said. Inflation peaked at a 9.1% annual rate in June 2022 during worldwide supply chain problems after the economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. Overall consumer prices have fallen since then, but have ticked up in recent months, from 2.4% in September to 2.9% in December, the latest figures available. Economists have warned that Trump’s plans for tariffs and tax cuts could create new inflationary pressures and keep interest rates elevated. Vice President JD Vance, in an interview with CBS’ “Face the Nation” airing Sunday, defended the White House’s work so far. “Prices are going to come down, but it’s going to take a little bit of time, right?” he said. He added, “Rome wasn’t built in a day.” Trump’s relative shift away from addressing costs could create an opening for Democrats to say he is not helping working-class voters, hoping that argument could offer the party a path back to power in Washington. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said Trump preferred to distract people from inflation with talk of adding Greenland to the United States or seizing the Panama Canal. “It’s catnip and it causes everybody to stop paying attention to their actual economic agenda, which has nothing to do with lowering costs and everything to do with rigging the economy to help the Mar-a-Lago crowd,” he said. During an interview on Fox News this past week, host Sean Hannity struggled to get Trump to focus on the economy. “Let me get to the economy,” Hannity said at one point. “I’m running out of time.” “The economy is going to do great,” Trump insisted. When Trump did talk about inflation in the interview, he noted how low it was during his first term and insisted prices would not have jumped up if he had president after the 2020 election, even though higher inflation was a global trend coming out of the pandemic. It is not clear how Trump would persuade oil companies and foreign countries to quickly increase production, possibly costing them profits. The Energy Information Administration reported that domestic oil production has grown at an annual rate of roughly 8.4% over the past two years to an average of nearly 13.5 million barrels a day in October. Some Trump aides suggest that could increase by an additional 3 million barrels a day. It would be difficult to achieve that much additional production in a single year without serious changes to the global market. The International Energy Agency estimates that the oil supplied to the entire world will increase by 1.8 million barrels per day to 104.7 million barrels a day. He also has expressed opposition to climate-friendlier wind and solar energy, putting more pressure on the U.S. economy to rely on fossil fuels. EJ Antoni, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, said the potential increase in energy production under Trump would ultimately flow through the economy in the form of lower prices. “If you’re going to bring down the cost of energy, you’re going to bring down the cost of all kinds of goods and services,” he said. But there is a risk that some of Trump’s plans taken as a whole could raise — not reduce — prices. Deporting migrants who are in the United States illegally could deprive companies of lower wage workers. The cost of tariffs, which are taxes placed on foreign imports, could be passed on to consumers. Trump said that his strategy also might ultimately involvepublicly pressuring the Federal Reserveto cut interest rates, saying in Davos that he would “demand” lower rates from central banks. The Fed sees its political independence as key for making tough choices to stabilize prices. Biden saw the independence as worth protecting, whereas Trump sees it as problematic. The Fed raised its benchmark rates starting in 2022 to make it more expensive to borrow and succeeded enough in reducing inflationary pressures that it could trim rates late last year. Trump believes that greater oil production will put him in a position to tell the Fed what to do. Asked in the Oval Office if he expects the Fed to listen to him, Trump simply said, “Yeah.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Palestinian families have been displaced from the northern Gaza Strip since October 2023 when the Israel-Hamas war erupted. According to the ceasefire deal, the Israeli military had been expected to allow hundreds of thousands of Palestinian to return to northern Gaza through a road that bisects the territory starting Sunday. Israel has yet to allow Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza on foot through the so-called Netzarim corridor bisecting the territory, which extends from the Wadi Gaza river valley to Gaza City. It put the move on hold until Hamas freed a hostage who Israel said was supposed to have been released that day. (Production by Wafaa Shurafa) Israel has said that it needs to stay longer because the Lebanese army has not deployed to all areas of southern Lebanon to ensure that Hezbollah does not reestablish a military presence in the area. (AP Video shot by Bassam Al Masri)                                     DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel kept thousands of Palestinians from returning to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday as it accused Hamas of violatinga fragile ceasefireby changing the order of hostages it has released. Local health officials said Israeli forces fired on the crowd, killing two people and wounding nine. Israeli forcesalso opened fire in Lebanonon protesters demanding their withdrawal by Sunday’s deadline under a separate ceasefire with the Hezbollah militant group. Health officials in Lebanon said at least 22 people were killed and over 120 wounded. Israel says it hasn’t withdrawn because Lebanese forces are not deploying quickly enough, while Lebanon says its forces cannot move into areas until Israeli troops leave. U.S. President Donald Trump meanwhile suggested that most of Gaza’s populationbe at least temporarily resettled elsewhere, including in Egypt and Jordan, to “just clean out” the war-ravaged enclave. Jordan and the Palestinians swiftly rejected that, and Egypt has previously rejected the scenario, fearing Israelmight never allow refugees to return. Senior Hamas official Bassem Naim said Palestinians would never accept such a proposal, “even if seemingly well-intentioned under the guise of reconstruction.” He said the Palestinians can rebuild Gaza “even better than before”if Israel lifts its blockade. Under the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, Israel on Saturday was to begin allowing Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza throughthe Netzarim corridorbisecting the territory. Israel put that on hold until Hamas frees a civilian hostage who Israel said should have been released Saturday. Hamas accused Israel of violating the agreement.  Crowds of people carrying their belongings filled a main road leading to a closed Israeli checkpoint. “We have been in agony for a year and a half,” said Nadia Qasem. Fadi al-Sinwar, also displaced from Gaza City, said “the fate of more than a million people is linked to one person,” referring to the Israeli hostage, Arbel Yehoud. “See how valuable we are? We are worthless,” he said. Israeli forces fired on the crowds on three occasions overnight and into Sunday, killing two people and wounding nine, including a child, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. Israel’s military in a statement said it fired warning shots at “several gatherings of dozens of suspects who were advancing toward the troops and posed a threat to them.” Israel has pulled back from several areas of Gaza under the ceasefire, which came into effect last Sunday. The military has warned people to stay away from its forces, which still operate in a buffer zone inside Gaza along the border and in the Netzarim corridor. Hamasfreed four female Israeli soldierson Saturday, and Israel released some 200 Palestinian prisoners, most of whom were serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks. But Israel said Yehoud should have been released ahead of the soldiers. The release of four Israeli hostages Saturday comes nearly a week into a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and is part of a long and uncertain process aimed at eventually ending the war. The AP’s Sam Mednick explains. Israel also accused Hamas of failing to provide details on the conditions of hostages set to be freed in the remaining five weeks of the ceasefire’s first phase. In a statement, Hamas said it had told mediators — the United States, Egypt and Qatar — that Yehoud was alive and provided guarantees that she would be released. A spokesman for Gaza’s second-largest militant group, Islamic Jihad, later said the dispute over Yehoud had been settled. Mohamed al-Hajj Mousa said the group told mediators she will be released before Saturday. But an Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the behind-the-scenes talks, said there was still no deal. The ceasefire is aimed at ending the 15-month war triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack and freeing hostages still held in Gaza in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Around 90 hostages are still in Gaza, and Israeli authorities believe at least a third, and up to half, have died. Itzik Horn, the father of hostages Iair and Eitan Horn, called any resumption of fighting “a death sentence for the hostages” and criticized government ministers who want the war to go on. The ceasefire’s first phase runs until early March and includes the release of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The second — and far more difficult — phase, has yet to be negotiated. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining hostages without an end to the war, while Israel has threatened to resume its offensive until Hamas is destroyed. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 attack, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. More than 100 were freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the remains of dozens more, at least three of them mistakenly killed by Israeli forces. Seven have been freed in the latest ceasefire. Israel’s military campaign has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not say how many of the dead were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. Israeli bombardment and ground operationshave flattened wide swaths of Gazaand displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. Many who have returned home since the ceasefire began have found only mounds of rubble. Magdy reported from Cairo and Krauss from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

        "content": "The Democratic senator also said Tulsi Gabbard isn't qualified to serve as DNI. Michigan Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin explained why she voted against confirming Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense on ABC News' \"This Week\" on Sunday, saying she had not been confident Hegseth would be more loyal to the Constitution than he would be to President Donald Trump.. Hegseth, a former Fox News host, was sworn into the role on Saturday following a razor-thin vote in the Senate. Slotkin, who joined the Senate in January and previously worked for multiple national security agencies, including the Department of Defense, told \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz that it was important in confirmation hearings that nominees knew they were \"raising your right hand and pledging an oath to the Constitution -- not Donald Trump -- and that if Donald Trump asks you to do something that contravenes the Constitution, you would push back.\" \"He couldn't unambiguously say that he will push back if the president asked him to do something that wasn't constitutional, and that, to me, is why I couldn't confirm him,\" Slotkin said. \"There's a lot of other things in his background I don't like, but I look at what is the strategic and irreversible threats to our democracy, and that's using the uniform military in ways that violate the Constitution.\" The vote to confirm Hegseth was initially 50-50 until Vice President JD Vance, in his role as president of the Senate, cast the tie-breaking vote. Every Democrat voted against Hegseth's confirmation, as did Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. His nomination process was marred by accusations ofsexual misconduct, excessive drinking and financial mismanagement of two different veterans organizations. He hasdeniedall the allegations. During Hegseth's confirmation hearing, Slotkin questioned him on whether he supports active-duty military members supporting immigrant detention centers if ordered to do so by Trump. With 1,500 soldiers and Marines now at or deploying to the border, Slotkin stressed on \"This Week\" that the military should not take on a law enforcement role in this new mission. \"According to our Constitution, you can go in supporting roles -- logistics, driving, setting up facilities, setting up, you know, border locations, whatever -- it's very different when you cross the line into law enforcement,\" she said. \"Our military are not trained as law enforcement officers -- they'll be the first one to tell you that. That's not why they got into service, and it's also in violation of our Constitution, so I think it's very important that we keep that line.\" Slotkin said it was important to know \"you're not going to use the uniform military in ways that violates the Constitution and makes American citizens scared of their own military.\" \"We were scared of the British when they occupied us,\" she said. \"We don't want to repeat that, so I'm watching that very, very closely.\" Slotkin also spoke about Tulsi Gabbard's upcoming confirmation hearing for the role of director of national intelligence. Slotkin was one of the first employees in the director's office, working there between 2005 and 2006 in between stints at the CIA as an analyst. \"I served with Tulsi Gabbard. We were on the Armed Services Committee together. She didn't spend a lot of time showing up to hearings, so I didn't get to see her in action all that much,\" Slotkin said. \"But from what I understand from people who have been meeting directly with her -- and she hasn't asked to meet with me -- is that she doesn't show the competence, the understanding, the depth. She wasn't prepared for her meetings, not to mention the deeply questionable decisions she's made of cozying up to [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, flying and cozying up with Assad in Syria.\" Slotkin said she does \"not believe [Gabbard] is qualified for this role.\" \"You know, having someone in charge of our intelligence organization that shows a preference for our adversaries, to me, is just right off the bat, a deep question,\" Slotkin said. \"And so again, I hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who now have control of the Senate, control of the House, that they think about, again, their commitment to the country, not to any one party.\" Gabbard's confirmation hearing is scheduled for Thursday before the Senate Intelligence Committee. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "Homan says administration has a “clear” message for undocumented immigrants. For the first time in U.S. history, military aircraft were used this past week to deport scores of undocumented migrants from the United States. Middle schools, Trump administration officials say, are now seen as places to target for immigration enforcement operations. And, according to President Trump's \"border czar,\" every undocumented immigrant should worry they could be arrested at any time, even if they have no criminal record. The \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, says it's all part of the Trump administration's effort to send a \"clear\" message: \"There's consequences [for] entering the country illegally,\" he told ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz on Sunday. \"If we don't show there's consequences, you're never going to fix the border problem,\" he said. More than 11 million undocumented immigrants are currently estimated to be living in the U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to take unprecedented action to remove as many of them as possible and stem the flow of more migrants coming to the southern border. In his first several days in office, Trump declared a national emergency at the border, announced an end to the so-called practice of \"catch and release\" -- when migrants claiming asylum are given court dates and then released pending those proceedings -- and sought to overturn the long-held Constitutional right of birthright citizenship, a move that immediately faced legal challenges and was at least temporarily blocked by a federal judge. As for the millions of undocumented immigrants already in the country, Homan said the administration will deport \"as many as we can,\" starting with threats to public safety threats and national security, Homan said. According to estimates released by House Republicans last year, based on government data, hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants in the country are convicted criminals or have charges pending against them. Government statistics indicate that in the past four years, hundreds of migrants were caught along the southern border with names matching known or suspected terrorists on a government watchlist. And Homan has said more than 2 million people were detected along the border but never captured, so authorities don't know who they are or what threat some of them could pose. According to statistics released by the Department of Homeland Security last year, a tiny fraction of those who reached U.S. borders in the prior three years had any kind of criminal record, and the vast majority of them involved nonviolent crimes, such as driving under the influence or previously entering the country illegally. Homan told ABC News that the Trump administration is only \"in the beginning stages\" of carrying out its mass deportation plan, making public safety threats and national security threats a \"priority,\" but \"as that aperture opens, there'll be more arrests nationwide.\" And he warned that there will be \"collateral arrests,\" especially in the so-called \"sanctuary cities\" that he says are resistant to helpingImmigrationand Customs Enforcement officials locate and arrest undocumented immigrants already in local custody for other crimes. \"Sanctuary cities lock us out of the jails,\" said Homan, who led ICE as acting director in Trump's first administration. According to Homan, that creates significant safety concerns: When an undocumented immigrant arrested for a serious crime is released by local authorities, instead of being deported, it \"endangers the community.\" Nevertheless, Homan said that's a time when ICE officers would likely make \"collateral arrests.\" \"When we find him, he's going to be with others … [and] if they're in the country illegally, they're coming too,\" he said. He emphasized that anyone in the country unlawfully is \"on the table.\" \"It's not OK to violate the laws of this country,\" he said. \"We have millions of people standing in line, taking the test, doing their background investigation, paying the fees that want to come in the right way.\" \"So if you're in the country illegally, you got a problem,\" he said. On Monday, during Trump's first day in office, acting Homeland Security Secretary Benjamine Huffman issued a directive telling immigration authorities they could conduct operations in so-called \"sensitive\" areas that he said were off-limits during the Biden administration. \"Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America's schools and churches to avoid arrest,\" he said in a statement. Others, however, said the administration was simply creating fear within the immigrant community, with the chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on Migration saying that \"turning places of care, healing and solace into places of fear and uncertainty … will note make our communities safer. He said that as they prioritize national security threats and public safety threats, ICE officers might have to even go into schools because \"many\" members of gangs tied to South and Central America, such as MS-13, are between 14 and 17 years old. In his interview with ABC News, Homan said that no other law enforcement agency is restricted from entering certain locations to promote public safety in the same way ICE has been. \"Name another agency, another law enforcement agency, that has those type of requirements, that they can't walk into a school or doctor's office or a medical campus,\" he said. \"No other agency is held to those standards.\" \"These are well-trained [ICE] officers with a lot of discretion, and when it comes to a sensitive location, there's still going to be supervisory review,\" he said. \"But ICE officers should have discretion to decide if a national security threat or a public safety threat [is] in one of these facilities.\" Homan said anyone already in the country unlawfully \"should leave,\" and those looking to claim asylum should \"do it the legal way.\" \"Go to the embassy, go to the point of entry,\" he said. \"You shouldn't come to this country and ask to get asylum and the first thing you do is break our laws by entering illegally.\" In the meantime, Homan said the Trump administration is using not just the military but the \"whole\" government, including the Justice Department, to support its mass deportation plan, which allows ICE officers to concentrate on conducting enforcement operations. But Homan acknowledged that the federal government won't be able to remove every undocumented immigrant in the U.S., and that his \"success is going to be based on what Congress gives us.\" ICE doesn't currently have enough funding from Congress to detain all of the undocumented immigrants that the Trump administration says it hopes to arrest. \"I'm being realistic,\" he said. \"We can do what we can with the money we have. We're going to try to be efficient. But with more money we have, the more we can accomplish.\" \"What price [do] you put on national security?\" he added. \"When you … don't secure that border, that's when national security threats enter the country. That's when sex trafficking goes up. That's when, you know, that's when the fentanyl comes in.\" As for what success practically looks like at the end of the Trump administration, Homan said: \"Our success every day is taking a public safety threat off the streets or getting a national security threat out of here.\" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "content": "Since June 1, 2024, Los Angeles has only picked up 0.03 inches of rainfall. Rain was falling across Southern California on Sunday, bringing some relief to thousands of firefighters battling multiplemajor blazesfor nearly a month in the Los Angeles area, but also prompting new threats of floods and mudslides across burn-scarred lands. A flood watch issued by the National Weather Service is to go into effect at 10 a.m. local time on Sunday for fire-ravaged areas of Los Angeles County, which has been ground zero for the historic firestorms that have leveled thousands of homes and killed at least 28 people since first igniting on Jan. 7. The flood watch will remain in effect until Monday afternoon in burn-scarred areas left by the Eaton, Palisades, Franklin, Bridge and Hughes fires. The rain is forecast to be widespread but is expected to be light enough to avoid major flooding. But if a downpour spends enough time over one of the recent burn scars, a debris flow could become an issue. Rain totals from the storm will mostly range from a half-inch to an inch, allowing for a decent soaking for the first time in months. Since June 1, Los Angeles has only picked up 0.03 inches of rainfall, which has allowed an extreme drought to develop across the area for the first time in two years. In addition to rain, higher elevations of Southern California, including the San Gabriel Mountains straddling northern Los Angeles and western San Bernardino counties, are expecting snow, with areas above 4,000 feet getting up to 14 inches of powder. The rain and snow forecast comes as firefighters continued to battle five active fires on Sunday from Ventura County north of Los Angeles to the Mexican border south of San Diego. The Palisades Fire, which ignited on Jan. 7 in Los Angeles County's Pacific Palisades, was 84% contained as of Sunday after burning more than 23,000 acres, destroying nearly 7,000 structures and killing 11 people, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). The Eaton Fire, which also broke out on Jan. 7 in Pasadena and Altadena, was 95% contained on Sunday after burning more than 14,000 acres, destroying more than 9,400 structures and killing 17 people. Other fires still active on Sunday, according to Cal Fire, include the Hughes Fire near Castaic Lake, about 45 miles north of downtown Los Angeles, which was 90% contained after starting on Wednesday and burning more than 10,000 acres of brush land; the Border 2 Fire that broke out Thursday near the San Diego-Mexico border and is 10% contained after burning more than 6,600 acres of wilderness land; and the Laguna Fire, which also started Thursday in Camarillo in Ventura County, which was 98% contained on Sunday after charring 83 acres and prompting a brief evacuation of the California State University Channel Islands. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Bove said he was in Chicago on Sunday morning and observed Department of Homeland Security agents, along with assisting federal agencies — including the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives. He didn’t say where the operations took place in the city or detail any arrests. “We will support everyone at the federal, state, and local levels who joins this critical mission to take back our communities,” Bove said in a statement. “We will use all available tools to address obstruction and other unlawful impediments to our efforts to protect the homeland. Most importantly, we will not rest until the work is done.” U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Jeff Carter said the agency “began conducting enhanced targeted operations” Sunday in Chicago but declined other details, citing an ongoing operation. Spokesmen for the FBI, ATF and the Drug Enforcement Administration confirmed their involvement but didn’t give other information. Chicago residents, especially in immigrant circles,have already been on edgefor months in anticipation of large-scale arrests touted by the Trump administration. The atmosphere has been especially tense the past week as top Trump officialsvowedto start immigration enforcement operations in Chicago the day after Trump’sinaugurationbefore walking back those statements.  Immigrant rights groups havetried to preparewith campaigns for immigrants to know their rights in case of an arrest. City officials have done the same, publishing similar information at public bus and train stations. On Friday, Chicago Public Schools officialsmistakenly believedICE agents had come to a city elementary school and put out statements to that effect before learning the agents were from the Secret Service. Word of immigration agents at a school — which have long been off limits to immigration agents untilTrump ended the policylast week — drew swift criticism from community groups and Gov. JB Pritzker. The Democratic governor, a frequent Trump critic, questioned the aggressive approach of the operations and the chilling effect for others, particularly for law-abiding immigrants who have been in the country for years. “We need to get rid of the violent criminals. But we also need to protect people, at least the residents of Illinois and all across the nation, who are just doing what we hope that immigrants will do,” Pritzker said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Chicago has been one of Trump’s favorite targets. The city has some of the strongest sanctuary protections, which bar cooperation between city police and immigration agents. On Saturday, several Chicago-based immigrant rights groups filed a lawsuit against ICE, seeking an injunction prohibiting certain types of immigration raids in Chicago. “Immigrant communities who have called Chicago their home for decades are scared,” said Antonio Gutierrez from Organized Communities Against Deportation, one of the plaintiffs. “We refuse to live in fear and will fight any attempts to roll back the work we’ve done to keep families together.” Durkin Richer reported from Washington.

Bridgestone said the closure will help the company “optimize its business footprint” and “strengthen its competitiveness.” In addition, Bridgestone announced capacity and workforce reductions at its Des Moines, Iowa, agriculture tire plant and additional workforce reductions in U.S. corporate, sales and operations. In Latin America, it plans reductions in workforce and production capacity in Argentina and Brazil. “Reductions in force are impacting our corporate, sales and operations in the Americas where a realignment of staffing levels is needed in response to the challenging economic environment,” company spokesperson Emily Weaver said in an email. “Of our nearly 44,000 teammates across North America and Latin America, just under 4% of our teammates are leaving the company as part of the voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions.” The LaVergne plant was the first tire-producing facility in North America for the Bridgestone Corporation. The company stopped making tires for cars and light trucks at the plant in 2009, laying off roughly half of the workers at the time. LaVergne's United Steelworkers master union workers have preferential hiring rights at the company's plants in Des Moines; Akron, Ohio; and Russellville, Arkansas, Weaver said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

All Rights Reserved. “Nosferatu” writer-director Robert Eggers and stars Lily-Rose Depp, Nicholas Hoult and Willem Dafoe sat down with Associated Press entertainment journalist Krysta Fauria to talk about what makes their adaptation of the classic vampire film unique — and how Eggers builds sprawling cinematic worlds.  Adria Arjona’s big year included roles in Richard Linklater’s “Hit Man” opposite Glen Powell, “The Absence of Eden” alongside Zoe Saldaña — and Zoë Kravitz’s directorial debut “Blink Twice.” She’s now celebrating the release of “Los Frikis,” which she also executive produced, and returns next year to the acclaimed Star Wars series “Andor.” After being named one of AP’s Breakthrough Entertainers of 2024, the 32-year-old star sat down with AP entertainment journalist Leslie Ambriz to talk about her journey into film and TV, her mother’s on-set support, and boosting Latin American stories in Hollywood.  How many roads must a man walk down to play Bob Dylan? Quite a few, at least, if you’re Timothée Chalamet. Off and on for some six years, the 28-year-old star has been obsessively working toward his performance in “A Complete Unknown.” Chalamet spoke with AP film writer Jake Coyle about his favorite Dylan songs, traveling to Hibbing, Minn. as part of his research, and what artists like Frank Ocean share in common with the iconic folk rocker.  Aaron Pierre is closing out his big year on a literal high note. After playing Malcolm X in the “Genius: MLK/X” series and starring in the Netflix action hit “Rebel Ridge,” he showcases his vocal talents in “Mufasa: The Lion King.” The the 30-year-old English actor, named an AP Breakthrough Entertainer of 2024, sat down with AP entertainment editor Ryan Pearson to talk about his upbringing in South London, FaceTiming with his mom and “throwing the baseball” with Lin-Manuel Miranda.  “Queer” star Daniel Craig says the secret to filming intimate scenes with co-star Drew Starkey was to keep things light. In an interview with AP entertainment journalist Krysta Fauria, the pair discussed working with an intimacy coordinator, Luca Guadagnino’s directing style — and the legacy of Beat Generation writer and “Queer” author William S. Burroughs.  Country music comes naturally to Ringo Starr. The former Beatle has dabbled in the music ever since singing the country hit “Act Naturally” with the Beatles in 1965, and he’s now about to release a whole country album. Starr says in an interview with The Associated Press’ Andrew Dalton that he’s put a bit of country in most everything he’s done, so the album wasn’t too big a stretch. Starr says the project began when he bumped into his friend, classic country aficionado T-Bone Burnett, and asked him to write a song. Burnett came back with nine. The resulting album, “Look Up,” comes out in January.  Erykah Badu has been a music disruptor, culture shifter and style maven ever since she stepping into the limelight with her 1997 debut album, “Baduizm.” The four-time Grammy winner, who was recently honored with the CFDA (Council of Fashion Designers of America) Icon award, sat down with AP entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton to talk about her fashion influence, working on new music, her appearance in “The Piano Lesson” —and finally learning to stop and smell the flowers.  Paul Mescal plays the titular gladiator Lucius and Denzel Washington is aspiring emperor Macrinus in Ridley Scott’s Roman epic “Gladiator II.” The two stars sat down with AP entertainment journalist Sian Watson in London to talk about robes, bulking up, their 86-year-old director — and working with friends and family.  Thirty years after the Oscar-winning “Forrest Gump,” Tom Hanks and Robin Wright have joined once again with director Robert Zemeckis for the family drama “Here.” It’s Hanks’ fifth film with Zemeckis and Wright’s fourth. They sat down with AP entertainment editor Ryan Pearson to discuss their previous collaborations: “Gump” (both, 1994), “Cast Away” (Hanks, 2000), “The Polar Express” (Hanks, 2004), “Beowulf” (Wright, 2007), “A Christmas Carol” (Wright, 2009) and “Pinocchio” (Hanks, 2022).  Tim Heidecker is working through his existential dread, in the form of song. Best known for his absurdist comedy, he’s leaned more into songwriting in recent years. He sat down with AP entertainment journalist Krysta Fauria to talk about his latest album “Slipping Away,” which moves between semi-fictional apocalyptic storytelling and poignant, vulnerable reflections on fatherhood, aging and success.  Mikey Madison stars in “Anora” as a Brooklyn exotic dancer who spontaneously marries the son of a Russian oligarch. She sat down with AP entertainment journalist Krysta Fauria to talk about how she landed the role with writer-director Sean Baker, preparing her little brother for a screening, improv — and the challenge of pole dancing.  Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh star in John Crowley’s “We Live In Time,” which tells the story of a relationship over the course of a decade. The two actors sat down with AP film writer Jake Coyle to talk about on-screen chemistry, processing the heavier moments of the film — and that infamous carousel horse meme.  N.T. Rama Rao Jr. is following up the international success of “RRR” with the action-drama “Devara: Part 1,” in which he plays both a mythical hero and a son struggling with his dad’s legacy. Rama Rao says Los Angeles has become his “lucky charm” after last year’s trip to the Oscars — where “Naatu Naatu” won best song — and a subsequent invitation to join the U.S. film academy. The 41-year-old, whose father and grandfather were both prominent actors and political leaders, sat down with AP entertainment editor Ryan Pearson to talk about his own perspective on fatherhood, filming crowd-pleasing underwater scenes, staying “innocent” as an actor — and his love for the Will Smith film “The Pursuit of Happiness.”  RZA’s hoarding habit led to his newest adventure in music: a ballet and surprisingly traditional classical music album he calls “A Ballet Through Mud.” He sat down with AP entertainment editor Ryan Pearson to talk about the nostalgic genesis of the project, the growing bridge between the worlds of classical and hip-hop, and his hopes for what happens next with his composition and ballet.  After releasing 18 albums over more than two decades, Xiu Xiu is still making music for outsiders. With the release of “13'’ Frank Beltrame Italian Stiletto with Bison Horn Grips,” band leader Jamie Stewart spoke with AP entertainment journalist Krysta Fauria about balancing harmony and dissonance, moving to Berlin — and why the band “wouldn’t exist” without David Lynch’s “Twin Peaks” universe.  Usher’s new concert film ‘Usher: Rendezvous in Paris’ is playing in theaters through Sunday.

Brandy stars alongside Kathryn Hunter in A24’s horror film “The Front Room.” The two actors spoke with AP entertainment journalist Leslie Ambriz about decompressing after dark scenes, Brandy’s past forays into the horror genre — and filming in a haunted house.  Kathy Bates had “one foot out the door” and was ready to retire after recovering from cancer and an emotionally draining film project. Then she joined “Matlock.” The 76-year-old star says she’s been rejuvenated by the legal procedural series’ creator and her co-stars. She sat down with AP entertainment journalist Kaitlyn Huamani to talk about learning to trust again in Hollywood, working with Ryan Murphy and Dustin Hoffman — and the value of storytelling.  Six years after “A Star is Born,” Lady Gaga returns to the Venice Film Festival with “Joker: Folie à Deux” alongside Joaquin Phoenix and director Todd Phillips. She sat down with AP film writer Lindsey Bahr to talk about creating a new voice for her Lee/Harley Quinn character, writing a “waltz that falls apart” for the film — and why it’s an “exciting time” in pop music. Phillips shares why he chose her for the role, singing on set — and using the film to pose the question: “What is entertainment?”  Angelina Jolie portrays renowned opera singer Maria Callas in Pablo Larraín’s “Maria,” focusing on her life in Paris in the 70s before her death at age 53. They sat down with AP entertainment editor Louise Dixon at the Venice Film Festival to discuss how Jolie connected with Callas, the difficulty of performing opera — and why the film, to be released on Netflix, is the most personal of Larraín’s biopic trilogy that includes “Spencer” and “Jackie.”  Nearly a decade after his last full-length release, Zedd is releasing “Telos.” The Grammy-winning producer/DJ says he needed to push himself to make an album that would move the needle — one that told a story beyond the success of his debut LP, “Clarity,” or “True Colors.” The German dance-pop maverick says the album — which features collaborators ranging from Muse and John Mayer to Remi Wolf and Bea Miller — is “an album that for many years I doubted I could create.” He spoke with AP entertainment journalist Rick Taber about the long process of creating “Telos,” being inspired by Jeff Buckley and the state of EDM.  “Only Murders in the Building” has become a “safe place” for Selena Gomez as the hit Hulu comedy enters its fourth season. She sat down alongside co-stars and longtime friends Steve Martin and Martin Short to speak with AP entertainment journalist Leslie Ambriz about on-set confidence, finding your ‘number one’ in the industry and more.  “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” stars Jenna Ortega, Catherine O’Hara and Winona Ryder sat down with AP entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton to talk about the significance and pressure of releasing a sequel 36 years after the original 1988 horror comedy hit, their bonds with director Tim Burton — and O’Hara’s thoughts on working again with “Home Alone” co-star Macaulay Culkin.  Tinashe thought she might have hit on her hands with “Nasty” — but never expected it become such a viral success. The R&B and pop star spoke with the AP’s Gary Gerard Hamilton about her new album “Quantum Baby,” how she now defines success, and maintaining career momentum over the years through changes in the the music industry.  MTV’s “The Challenge” is looking back as it celebrates 26 years of big personalities and big drama. The reality competition series’ stars Johnny “Bananas” Devenanzio, Aneea Ferreira and Nurys Mateo — along with host TJ Lavin — sat down with AP entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton to talk about the 40th season, which features 40 returning competitors in a “Battle of the Eras.”  Michael Keaton says it would have been a “huge mistake” for his titular trickster ghost character to get significantly more screen time in “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” than he did in the first film. The 72-year-old star sat down with AP entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton to talk about why he was nervous to return for the sequel featuring Jenna Ortega and Winona Ryder, the impact of Tim Burton’s original 1988 horror comedy — and why he never thought of himself as playing Batman.  Justin Baldoni’s “It Ends With Us” journey began well before Colleen Hoover’s novel became a sensation on TikTok. The 40-year-old actor and filmmaker optioned the book in 2019 while he was shooting “Jane The Virgin” and preparing to release his feature film directorial debut, “Five Feet Apart.” Five years later, he spoke with AP entertainment journalist Alicia Rancilio about directing and co-starring alongside Blake Lively in the drama that revolves around domestic violence.  It is not easy to be an outsider in country music, but Orville Peck has made a career out of it. On his third album, “Stampede,” his nonconformist spirit has led to collaborations with everyone from Willie Nelson and Elton John to Mickey Guyton and Kylie Minogue. The 36-year-old South African musician has been steadily stripping back his mask since his 2019 debut album “Pony.” Peck spoke with AP music journalist Maria Sherman about his growing confidence, his high-profile collaborations and country radio.  Josh Hartnett is looking back at shedding his Hollywood heartthrob image in the 2000s as he stars in M. Night Shyamalan’s thriller “Trap.” Hartnett is now 46 and lives in England with his wife and four children. While he’s been working steadily since breaking out in 1998 with a “Halloween” sequel and “The Faculty,” he intentionally moved away from studio movies and leading man roles after being typecast as his fame grew with movies like “Black Hawk Down” and “Pearl Harbor.” In “Trap,” Hartnett plays a father with a secret who takes his daughter to a pop concert — which is surrounded by police searching for a serial killer.  M. Night Shyamalan has been at least partly self-financing his films since 2015’s “The Visit,” risking his own money on box office success. His latest is “Trap,” starring Josh Hartnett as a father with a secret and Shyamalan’s daughter Saleka as a pop star whose concert is surrounded by police looking to capture a serial killer. Shyamalan spoke with AP entertainment editor Ryan Pearson about his high-risk, high-reward, lower-budget filmmaking approach, guiding his daughters’ artistic pursuits — and his philosophy that “talent is process.”  Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

The government is consulting on whether to let tech firms use copyrighted material to help train artificial intelligence models unless the creators explicitly opt out. McCartney told the BBC that would make it harder for artists to retain control of their work and undermine Britain’s creative industries. “You get young guys, girls, coming up, and they write a beautiful song, and they don’t own it, and they don’t have anything to do with it. And anyone who wants can just rip it off,” the 82-year-oldformer Beatlesaid in an interview to be broadcast Sunday. An extract was released Saturday by the BBC. “The truth is, the money’s going somewhere. When it gets on the streaming platforms, somebody is getting it, and it should be the person who created it. It shouldn’t be some tech giant somewhere.” Britain’s center-leftLabour Party governmentsays it wants to make the U.K. a world leader in AI. In December, it announced a consultation into how copyright law can “enable creators and right holders to exercise control over, and seek remuneration for, the use of their works for AI training” while also ensuring “AI developers have easy access to a broad range of high-quality creative content.” Publishers, artists’ organizations and media companies, including The Associated Press, have banded together as the Creative Rights in AI Coalition to oppose weakening copyright protections. “We’re the people, you’re the government. You’re supposed to protect us. That’s your job,” McCartney said. “So you know, if you’re putting through a bill, make sure you protect the creative thinkers, the creative artists, or you’re not going to have them.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "content": "Officials say they have recaptured the final four monkeys who escaped two months ago from a South Carolina compound that breeds them for medical research YEMASSEE, S.C. --Authorities in South Carolina said Friday the last four of 43 escaped monkeys have been recaptured after two months living in the woods, weathering arare snowstormand being temped back into captivity by peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. The rhesus macaque monkeys, all females, made a break for it after police say an employee did notfully lock their enclosureat Alpha Genesis, a facility that breeds them for medical research — known to locals as “the monkey farm.” The recaptured monkeys appeared to be in good health, Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard said in a statement relayed by Yemassee Police in a social media post, without further details. While they were on the loose, the area saw its first snow in seven years, accumulating up to 3 inches (8 centimeters). The rhesus macaques made a break for it on Nov. 6, and mostly hung around near the facility. They're about the size of a cat, weighing roughly 7 pounds (3 kilograms). It appears a worker unintentionally left the gates unlocked when the monkeys escaped, Westergaard said in November. Workers were supposed to lock and latch one gate before opening another, but all three gates and latches were left unsecure. The monkeys posed no risk to public health, said Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police. Alpha Guard employees kept an eye on the monkeys and set out humane traps. Most were lured back with food and were given peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and \"monkey biscuits\" — a high-protein Purina Monkey Chow specially formulated for the rhesus macaques. The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical facilities and other researchers. Humans have beenusing the monkeys for scientific researchsince the late 1800s. Scientists believe rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25 million years ago and share about 93% of the same DNA. The compound is about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee and about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)           DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — From activists on the far right toElon Musk, allies of PresidentDonald Trumphave been quick to threaten primary challengers for Republican senators who don’t back hisCabinet picksand legislative priorities. In the case of Iowa’s Joni Ernst, conservatives threatened to run against her if she didn’t backTrump’s pick for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth— before she announced she would. Louisiana’s Bill Cassidy, a doctor before entering politics, is being closely watched for how he will questionRobert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s nominee for health secretary South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham, a Trump confidant, has long been targeted by the far right in his state and was booed at a home-state rally during the 2024 presidential campaign. The Associated Press talked to people connected to five senators who have been targeted online or by rivals in their states. Here’s a look at each of their potential races and what they face: Ernst prompted criticism from the right after she initially stopped short of endorsing Hegseth, who wasconfirmed by the Senateon Friday. Ernst voted “yes.” A retired Iowa National Guard lieutenant colonel and Iraq War veteran, Ernst is also a sexual assault survivor. After Trump announced Hegseth’s nomination, she said she hoped to discuss with him comments that he had made opposing women serving in combat roles, and about an allegation, which he denied and was not charged for, that he sexually assaulted a woman he met at a 2017 conference.  Hegseth, at Ernst’s suggestion, affirmed that that “every man and woman has opportunity to serve their country in uniform and to do so at any level as long as they are meeting the standards that are set forward.” Hegseth also said that if confirmed, he would appoint a senior-level official dedicated to sexual assault prevention and response. Potential challengers to Ernst: Conservative media figure Steve Deace, who posted on Facebook in December that “I don’t want to be a Senator, but I am willing to primary her for the good of the cause.” Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird wrote in a December opinion piece in Breitbart that some unnamed “D.C. politicians” thought “they can ignore the voices of their constituents and entertain smears” from news media outlets. That prompted speculation that Bird, who endorsed Trump before the 2024 Iowa caucuses, might challenge Ernst, who stayed neutral beforehand. Charlie Kirk of the conservative group Turning Point also called for Ernst to face a primary. An effort to boost Hegseth’s nomination led to Ernst’s office receiving thousands of calls. Cause for concern: Neither Deace nor Bird has taken any public steps toward running. Some prominent social conservatives are bothered by Ernst’s joining with a dozen Republicans and the Senate’s Democratic majority in 2022 to support repealing the Defense of Marriage Act to recognize the validity of same-sex marriages. But she remains popular with Iowa’s power players. “Anyone who says with a straight face that they are going to beat Joni Ernst in a primary today is kidding themselves,” said Luke Martz, an Iowa Republican consultant. “It would be a fool’s errand.” Tillis angered some on the right for not immediately supporting Trump’s first pick for attorney general, former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz. Though Gaetz withdrew from consideration, Tillis remains a frustration to some among North Carolina’s right wing, in part for voting to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act. Potential challengers: Andy Nilsson, a onetime candidate for lieutenant governor, has filed paperwork to challenge Tillis. The retired businessman has called for a return to the Reagan-Bush Republican ethos, hardly an attack from the right. Tillis faced three Republican challengers in 2020, all posing as more conservative than him. Cause for concern: Tillis has reason to expect a right-wing challenge. That faction helped lift former Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson to the 2024 nomination for governor last year. But North Carolina is expected to be among the most competitive states for Senate Republicans to hold in 2026. Roy Cooper, a Democrat who just finished two terms as governor, has not ruled out running for the seat. National Republicans are aware of the risks of nominating someone too far to the right. Cooper’s Democratic successor, Gov. Josh Stein, beat Robinson by nearly 15 percentage points in a state that Trump won by 3 points. To that end, Trump’s team and Tillis have been working together behind the scenes, said former Gov. Pat McCrory, a fellow Republican. “I anticipate there will be threats of challenging him from the right. But I also think he’ll deal with it as he has, with hard work and a record of accomplishment,” McCrory said. “I think the incoming administration sees that.” “They also see he’s the best chance of keeping North Carolina red,” he added. Cassidy remains vulnerable in large part due to his vote to convict Trump after his second impeachment over the siege of the U.S. Capitol. “Our Constitution and our country is more important than any one person. I voted to convict President Trump because he is guilty,” Cassidy said in a statement after the February 2021 vote. Cassidy, in his second term, has not yet announced whether he will seek a third. A gastroenterologist before he entered politics, Cassidy will be closely watched for how he votes on Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic who has questioned medical consensus on several issues. Potential challengers: Cassidy has already drawn a Republican challenger, state Treasurer John Fleming. Fleming, a former U.S. House member from northern Louisiana, has said Cassidy’s impeachment vote “failed” Louisiana. Former U.S. Rep. Garrett Graves of Baton Rouge is also a potential challenger, as is Blake Miguez, a state senator from New Iberia. Louisiana last year did away with its 50-year tradition of “jungle primaries,” where candidates from all parties ran in the same contest in November. Cassidy would now run in a closed Republican primary that might be more difficult if he faces one strong Trump-aligned challenger. Cause for concern: Cassidy’s vote to convict Trump remains a sticking point for Republicans in a state the president won with 60% last year. But Cassidy is viewed as having strong constituent relations and visibility in the state, political observers say. “Aside from that vote, I think he’s considered a good senator, and good at constituent work,” said Ellen Carmichael, a Louisiana Republican consultant and president of Washington-based Lafayette Company. “The base is unhappy with the vote he cast. But I wouldn’t count him out.” Cornyn in the past has been criticized within his own party for being too willing to work with Democrats and has drawn boos at GOP conventions in Texas. Commentator Tucker Carlson and others have urged a primary challenge against him. Last year, Cornyn told the Dallas Morning News that, “God willing,” he would seek reelection in 2026. According to federal filings, Cornyn had more than $3.5 million on hand in toward the end of 2024. Potential challengers: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is one of the state’s most powerful Republicans and also suggested Cornyn should be primaried. Paxton was acquitted in a 2023 impeachment effort and fraud charges against him were dropped last year. Cornyn and Paxton have sniped at each other on X, with Paxton calling Cornyn “anti-Trump” and “anti-gun” and the senator firing back, “Hard to run from prison, Ken.” Cause for concern: Brendan Steinhauser, a Republican strategist who has worked on Cornyn’s previous campaigns, noted that the senator remains undefeated in elections. “He’s never taken a race for granted. I would expect him to work extremely hard and crisscross the state of Texas to earn every vote possible in this upcoming election, assuming he has a primary challenger,” Steinhauser said. “I think it’s important for him to show the ways that he has worked with President Trump to enact the conservative America First agenda, and I would expect that would be a big part of his campaign message in a potential upcoming primary.” Seeking his fifth term, Graham will likely face primary challenges — he always has. County-level Republican parties have censured him a number of times for his willingness to work on bipartisan deals. One such measure derided Graham’s “condescending attitude” to the party’s grassroots organizers. He has even drawn boos at some events of the party faithful in his home state. That includes aJuly 2023 Trump rallyin Pickens — in the county where Graham grew up — where objections from the crowd drowned out more than five minutes of his remarks. When he took the stage, Trump also elicited boos when he mentioned Graham’s name. Graham has named a campaign leadership team, which says he has more than $15 million on hand, including nearly $1 million raised in the final quarter of 2024. Potential challengers: Rep. Ralph Norman represents South Carolina’s 5th Congressional District south of Charlotte, North Carolina, and is a member of the House Freedom Caucus. Another possible opponent could be Adam Morgan, a former South Carolina legislator who lost a primary bid last year against another congressman, Rep. William Timmons. Cause for concern: While he was highly critical of Trump in 2016 when they competed for the Republican nomination, Graham has backed Trump ever since his first administration, frequently serving as his golf partner and Capitol Hill surrogate. Trump has backed him in turn. When the crowd in Pickens booed Graham’s name, Trump said he was “going to have to work on these people” and added that Graham is “there when you need him.” Kinnard reported from Washington.

        "content": "Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote Friday. Pete Hegseth was sworn in to lead the Department of Defense on Saturday, after a narrow vote in the Senate. The vote on Friday night was initially 50-50, with Vice President JD Vance then casting the tie-breaking vote. Former GOP leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, voted no. He joined Sens. Susan Collins, of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, along with all Democrats in voting against Hegseth's nomination. The former Fox News host was sworn in at the White House on Saturday morning during a ceremony officiated by Vance. \"We look forward to having the backs of our troops and having your back in executing peace through strength, in putting America first. And in rebuilding our military,” Hegseth said in remarks at the ceremony, thanking Vance and President Donald Trump. In an official statement to the department, he said: \"It is the privilege of a lifetime to lead the warriors of the Department of Defense, under the leadership of our Commander in Chief Donald J. Trump. We will put America First, and we will never back down.\" Hegseth, a former\"Fox and Friends\" television anchor, was nominated by Trump in November to lead the Defense Department. In the time since his nomination was announced, Hegseth has beenscrutinized for a number of accusationsmade against him, including those of sexual assault and financial mismanagement of two different veterans organizations. Hegseth has fiercely deniedthe allegations. He appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee for a public hearing earlier this month, where he asserted to the panel that he was a \"changed man.\" \"I am not a perfect person, but redemption is real,\" he told the panel. Speaking to reporters while on a visit to Los Angeles, Trump said he was \"very happy\" with the vote, and said he was not aware of McConnell's vote. In a statement released while the vote was still going on, McConnell said that Hegseth's desire to be a \"change agent\" was not enough to qualify him for the role of secretary of defense. \"Effective management of nearly 3 million military and civilian personnel, an annual budget of nearly $1 trillion, and alliances and partnerships around the world is a daily test with staggering consequences for the security of the American people and our global interests,\" McConnell said in the statement. \"Mr. Hegseth has failed, as yet, to demonstrate that he will pass this test. But as he assumes office, the consequences of failure are as high as they have ever been.\" Hegseth was confirmed by one of the narrowest Senate margins of any defense secretary in modern history. Most defense secretaries have been confirmed with broad bipartisan votes. Lloyd Austin, former President Joe Biden's pick for defense secretary, was confirmed in a93-2 voteand Trump's first pick for defense secretary in his first term, James Mattis, was confirmed in a98-1 vote. Before the vote, Hegseth arrived at the Capitol with his wife and children to watch the proceedings in person, a rare move for a Cabinet nominee. With the Senate's vote Friday, Hegseth becomes the third member of Trump's team to be confirmed by the Senate, following Marco Rubio as secretary of state and John Ratcliffe, as CIA director. During the same hearing, he affirmed his promise to restore the \"warfighting ethos\" of the DOD, touting his experience in the National Guard. It was enough to win over the support of most Republicans in the Senate, including several of those who were initially skeptical. \"He articulated a clear vision of the Pentagon, and it was clear to anyone who listened that he is going to bring energy and fresh ideas to shake up the department's stagnant bureaucracy,\" Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a floor speech endorsing Hegseth on Thursday. \"He will restore a warfighting ethos and relentlessly focused on the military's core mission: to deter conflict and, if necessary, to win a war.\" The Senate Armed Services Committee advanced his nomination on a party-line vote on Monday. Then, in a closely watched moment on Thursday, Hegseth's nomination passed a key test vote that set the table for Friday's vote of final passage. The nomination only required a simple majority in the Senate to advance, and it cleared the threshold narrowly, with only GOP backing. Collins and Murkowski also voted no on that occasion. In a statement, Murkowski explained that she could not support Hegseth due to concerns about this character and lack of experience. \"I believe that character is the defining trait required of the Secretary of Defense and must be prioritized without compromise,\" Murkowski said in the post. \"The leader of the Department of Defense must demonstrate and model the standards of behavior and character we expect of all servicemembers, and Mr. Hegseth's nomination to the role poses significant concerns that I cannot overlook.\" Collins took issue with comments Hegseth made in the past about his belief that women should not serve in combat roles in the military. Though Hegseth has since changed his tune on that, Collins said she was unconvinced. \"I am also concerned about multiple statements, including some in the months just before he was nominated, that Mr. Hegseth has made about women serving in the military,\" Collins said. \"He and I had a candid conversation in December about his past statements and apparently evolving views. I am not convinced that his position on women serving in combat roles has changed.\" Trump expressed confidence in Hegseth ahead of the vote on Friday, though he added, \"You'll never know what's going to happen.\" McConnell, the former GOP leader, and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, ultimately cast votes in favor of advancing Hegseth's nomination in the earlier test vote, although the presidentquestioned whether McConnell will vote noon Hegseth Friday morning. Tillis said he was still considering the most recent slate of allegations against Hegseth, leveled in an affidavit from his former sister-in-law Danielle Hegseth. In that affidavit,which ABC News obtained, Danielle Hegseth attested that Pete Hegseth's ex-wife Samantha told her she \"once hid in her closet from him because she feared for her personal safety\" in the home they shared during their marriage. It also detailed episodes of binge drinking by Pete Hegseth. An attorney for Pete Hegseth denied these allegations, and the claims of abuse were also rejected by his ex-wife. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "title": "Trump fires multiple inspectors general in late-night move",
        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "Conversations about removing these watchdogs began during Trump's transition. In a late-night Friday move, President Donald Trump fired at least 17 independent watchdogs -- known as inspectors general -- at multiple federal agencies, sources familiar with the move told ABC News. The conversations about ousting these government watchdogsbegan during Trump's transitionback to the White House. While inspectors general can be fired by the president — it can only happen after communicating with Congress 30 days in advance and in 2022 Congress strengthened the law requiring administrations to give a detailed reasoning for the firing of an IG. There isn't yet have a complete list of all the IG's impacted, but at least one high-profile watchdog — Justice Department IG Michael Horowitz — did not receive notice that he was fired as of yesterday evening. Horowitz is an Obama appointee and has issued reports that have been critical of both the Trump and Biden administrations. The current law also mandates that any acting IG's must come from within the IG community, though it's unclear whether the Trump White House believes they need to follow that aspect of the law. The inspectors general were blindsided by emails they received Friday night from Sergio Gor, the director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, according to a source with knowledge of the firings. \"I am writing to inform you that due to changing priorities your position ... is terminated, effective immediately,\" read the emails reviewed by ABC News. Many of the IGs had met with Trump transition officials at their agencies and had productive conversations with the incoming administration, the source said. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Saturday that Congress was not given the required 30-day notice. While talking to reporters aboard Air Force One Saturday evening on his way from Las Vegas to Miami, Trump classified the firings as a \"common thing to do.\" \"Well, I did it because it's a very common thing to do – not all of them. Like Horowitz, we're keeping.\" He continued, \"It's a very standard thing to do, very much like the U.S. attorneys.\" \"There may be good reason the IGs were fired. We need to know that if so. I'd like further explanation from President Trump,\" Grassley said in a statement given to ABC News. \"Regardless, the 30 day detailed notice of removal that the law demands was not provided to Congress.\" Grassley told ABC News earlier this week that the president must tell Congress before removal. \"First of all to remind that our Inspector General can't be removed from office until the president, and that's any president, not just Trump. So this is a message to all these presidents you've got to tell Congress a month ahead of time the reasons for removing them,\" Grassley said. He added, \"And the other thing is that inspector generals are expected to be independent of political pressure, independent of the head of the agency, and to make sure that the law is enforced and money spent appropriately, and there shouldn't be any political pressure against any of his work.\" In a letter to the White House Friday, Mike Ware, the Small Business Administration inspector general and chair of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, said the firing of the independent watchdogs over email is not \"legally sufficient to dismiss Presidentially Appointed, Senate confirmed Inspectors General.\" The letter, obtained by ABC News, goes on to explain the removal process codified in the 2022 amendments to the inspectors general law. \"The requirement to provide the substantive rationale, including detailed and case specific reasons, was added to better enable Congress to engage on and respond to a proposed removal of an Inspector General in order to protect the independence of Inspectors General,\" Ware wrote. In floor remarks Saturday morning, Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer ripped into the Trump administration for the move, saying that the dismissals are a possible violation of federal law. \"These firings are Donald Trump's way of telling us he is terrified of accountability and is hostile to facts and to transparency,\" Schumer said. Republican Sen. Joni Ernst launched abipartisan IG caucusjust ten days ago. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the newly-minted group, told ABC News he'll be looking to his Republican colleagues on that panel to take some sort of action. \"We have a group, and it is bipartisan, that is supportive of inspectors general, and I think it is a real test of whether they are willing to let loose an unchecked surge of corruption and waste,\" he said. Reaction among Republican senators was mixed. Texas Sen. John Cornyn deferred to Grassley when asked for comment. \"I think we just take it one step at a time and try to understand what the rationale was,\" he said. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky, said he believes many of the inspectors general do need to be replaced and that Trump ultimately has the power to do so. But he noted there may be a process that needs to be followed. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who helped to pass the legislation in 2022 that strengthened the law requiring administrations to give a detailed reasoning for the firing of an IG, said she was frustrated by Trump's move. \"I don't understand why one would fire individuals whose mission is to root out waste, fraud and abuse,\" Collins said. \"So this leaves a gap in what I know is a priority for President Trump, so I don't understand it.\" Some Republican senators who have been staunch supporters of Trump, however, praised the firings. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said he's \"all for it\" when asked about Trump's move to dismiss the inspectors general. \"We need to clean house. I mean, if they're not for this country to move on down the road,\" he said. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., however, said the firing of the IG's was \"one more example of the lack of respect for the rule of law.\" \"He seems to be trying to throw a monkey wrench into the kind of any independence left in our government,\" Warner said of Trump. \"The whole idea of inspector generals is to have that independent check. Who is going to take those jobs going forward?\" Later Saturday, the ranking Democrats on the House committees sent a letter to Trump strongly condemning the firing of several inspectors general. \"Your actions violate the law, attack our democracy, and undermine the safety of the American people,\" the group wrote. \"Firing inspectors general without due cause is antithetical to good government, undermines the proper stewardship of taxpayer dollars, and degrades the federal government's ability to function effectively and efficiently,\" they added.

        "title": "No charges for Marilyn Manson after assault probe",
        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "Prosecutors say they won’t charge rocker Marilyn Manson after a years-long investigation into sexual assault and domestic violence allegations LOS ANGELES --Prosecutors said Friday that they will not file charges againstMarilyn Mansonafter a years-long investigation of allegations of sexual assault and domestic violence. Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said the allegations are too old under the law and the evidence is not sufficient to charge the 56-year-old shock rocker whose legal name is Brian Warner. “We have determined that allegations of domestic violence fall outside of the statute of limitations, and we cannot prove charges of sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt,” Hochman said. “We recognize and applaud the courage and resilience of the women who came forward to make reports and share their experiences, and we thank them for their cooperation and patience with the investigation.” Nearly four years after the investigation began, then-District Attorney George Gascón said on Oct. 9 that his office was pursuing new leads that added to the “already extensive” file that authorities had amassed. LA County sheriff’s detectives said early in 2021 that they were investigating Manson for incidents between 2009 and 2011 in West Hollywood, where Manson lived at the time. The probe included a search warrant that was served on his West Hollywood home. The case was initially turned over to prosecutors in September 2021, but the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office requested more evidence-gathering andthe investigation resumed. “We are very pleased that, after a thorough and incredibly lengthy review of all of the actual evidence, the District Attorney has concluded what we knew and expressed from the start — Brian Warner is innocent,” his attorney, Howard King, said in a statement. The identities of the women police and prosecutors spoke to were not revealed, but “Game of Thrones” actor Esmé Bianco — who sued Manson in a case that has been settled — said she was part of the criminal investigation. Before the decision not to prosecute, she criticized how long the process was taking at a rally for Hochman, who was elected soon after. “Almost four years ago, I did what victims of rape are supposed to do: I went to the police,” she said on Oct. 10. “I described to them in agonizing detail how the rock musician Brian Warner — better known by his stage name Marilyn Manson — had raped and abused me over the course of our relationship.” Bianco said she gave investigators “hundreds of pieces of evidence, including photos of my body covered in bites, bruises and knife wounds, emails and text messages, threats to my immigration status.” In her lawsuit, Bianco alleged sexual, physical and emotional abuse, and said that Manson violated human trafficking law by bringing her to California from England for non-existent roles in music videos and movies. “Whilst I am deeply disappointed by the decision of the District Attorney to not bring charges in the case against Brian Warner, I am sadly not surprised,” Bianco said in a statement released by her lawyer. “Once again, our justice system has failed survivors. Not the individual prosecutors and detectives who worked for years on this case, but the system that made them do so with one hand tied behind their collective backs.” In 2021 Manson's former fiancée, “Westworld” actor Evan Rachel Wood, named him as her abuser for the first time in an Instagram post. Wood and Manson’s relationship became public in 2007 when he was 38 and she was 19, and they were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up. “He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years,” Wood said. Manson replied on Instagram that these were “horrible distortions of reality.” He sued Wood, saying she and another woman fabricated accusations against him and convinced others to do the same. A judge threw out significant sections of the suit, then in November, Manson agreed to drop it and pay Wood's attorney fees. The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they’ve been sexually abused, unless they come forward publicly as Bianco and Wood have done. Other women sued Manson in the months after Wood came forward. Wood's representative did not immedately return a message Friday. Manson emerged as a musical star in the mid-1990s, known as much for courting public controversy as for hit songs like “The Beautiful People” and hit album’s like 1996’s “Antichrist Superstar” and 1998’s “Mechanical Animals.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)                       MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) —Alexander Zverevdescribed himself as “quite down” and “quite emotional” after once again coming within one win of earning his first Grand Slam title. And unlike his first two defeats in major finals — both of which he led, and both of which went five sets — Zverev did not come close to reaching the finish line Sunday in the Australian Open final, which ended with defending championJannik Sinner holding the trophy after his 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 victory. “I’m doing everything I can. I’m working as hard as I ever did. I think I’m doing all the right things off-court. I think I’m practicing the right things. But I lost in straight sets today. I mean, those are facts. That is a fact. I lost to Jannik in straight sets today,” said Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany who is ranked No. 2 but did not seem anywhere near No. 1 Sinner on this occasion. “I mean, I don’t want to end my career as the best player of all time to never win a Grand Slam, that’s for sure,” said Zverev, whosepost-match speech was interruptedby someone in Rod Laver Arena calling out the names of two women who haveaccused him of physical abusein the past. “I’ll keep doing everything I can,” Zverev said, “to lift one of those trophies.” He is the seventh man in the Open era, which dates to 1968, to start a career with an 0-3 record in title matches at one of the sport’s four most important events.  Five of the other six went on to win at least one major championship. The only member of the group who hasn’t is Casper Ruud, who is also the only one still active. Sinner offered support to Zverev during the trophy ceremony Sunday. That came in the form of an arm around the shoulder — and with his words. “Keep believing in yourself,” Sinner told Zverev. “Keep working hard, because we all believe that you can lift one of these very, very soon.” Simone Vagnozzi, one of Sinner’s coaches, said about Zverev: “I really hope, sooner or later, he wins a Slam, because he deserves it.” Zverev’s previous trips to the brink of achieving what he very badly wants came at the2020 U.S. Open, where he built a two-set lead and even held a match point against Dominic Thiem before faltering, and at the2024 French Open, where he led Carlos Alcaraz two sets to one before letting that slip away. This one never got to that sort of stage, and Zverev frequently showed his frustration by cracking rackets The nearest Zverev came to really making it close was when he was two points from taking the second set. But Sinner took the next four points and that, basically, was that. “That was a massive point. I think whoever wins that set, kind of can get a little bit of momentum. Being down two sets to love, especially, then his confidence goes up, mine goes down. It’s a long way back then against someone like Jannik,” Zverev said. “If it’s one set all, maybe I have a chance. But ... I didn’t stop fighting. I didn’t stop believing. Then, in the third set, I thought he outplayed me more than in the other sets.” More AP tennis:https://apnews.com/hub/tennis   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)               SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean prosecutors on Sunday indictedimpeached President Yoon Suk Yeolon rebellion in connection with his short-lived imposition of martial law, a criminal charge that could incur the death penalty or life imprisonment if convicted. This is thelatest blow to Yoon, who was impeached and arrested over his Dec. 3 martial law decree that plunged the country intopolitical turmoil, shook its financial markets and hurt its international image. Separate from criminal judicial proceedings, the Constitutional Court is now deliberating whether to formally dismiss Yoon as president or reinstate him. Yoon has become South Korea’s first president who has been indicted while in office. He will remain jailed and be escorted from a detention facility to a Seoul court for hearings in the trial, which is expected to last about six months. Prosecutors said in a statement that they indicted Yoon on charges that he directed a rebellion when he imposed martial law. Investigative authorities have earlier alleged that Yoon’s imposition of martial law amounted to rebellion, because he staged riots with the purpose of undermining the constitution. Yoon’s defense team lashed out at the indictment, calling it “the worst decision” by prosecutors who they say are trying to curry favor with political forces who want Yoon’s exit. “Today’s indictment of the president will remain as a shame in the history of South Korean prosecutors that they cannot erase,” Yoon’s defense team said in a statement. “We stress once again that a president’s declaration of martial law can never be rebellion.”  Yoon has presidential immunity from most criminal prosecutions, but the privilege doesn’t extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. By law in South Korea, the leader of a rebellion can face a life sentence or capital punishment. Yoon, a conservative, has steadfastlydenied any wrongdoing, describing his declaration of martial law as a legitimate act of governance meant to raise public awareness of the danger of the liberal-controlled National Assembly, which obstructed his agenda and impeached top officials. During his announcement of martial law, Yoon called the assembly “a den of criminals” and vowed to eliminate “shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces.” After declaring martial law on Dec. 3, Yoon sent troops and police officers to the assembly, but enough lawmakers still managed to enter an assembly chamber to vote down Yoon’s decree unanimously, forcing his Cabinet to lift it. The martial law imposition,the first of its kindin South Korea in more than four decades, lasted only six hours. However, it evoked painful memories of past dictatorial rules in South Korea in the 1960s-80s when military-backed rulers used martial laws and emergency decrees to suppress opponents. South Korea’s constitution gives the president the power to declare martial law to keep order in wartime and other comparable emergency states, but many experts say the country wasn’t under such conditions when Yoon declared martial law. Yoon insists that he hadno intentions of disrupting assembly work, including its floor vote on his decree and that deploying troops and police forces was meant to maintain order. But commanders of military units sent to the assembly have told assembly hearings or investigators that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to prevent them from overturning his decree. Investigations on Yoon have intensified the country’s already serious internal division,with rival protestersregularly staging rallies in downtown Seoul. After a local court on Jan. 19 approved a formal arrest warrant to extend Yoon’s detention, dozens of his supporters stormed the court building, destroying windows, doors and other property. They also attacked police officers with bricks, steel pipes and other objects. The violence left 17 police officers injured, and police said that they detained 46 protesters. Yoon earlier resisted efforts by investigative authorities to question or detain him.He then was apprehended on Jan. 15in a huge law enforcement operation at his presidential compound. Leading Yoon’s investigation was the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, but Yoon has refused to attend CIO questioning sessions since being detained, saying it has no legal authority to investigate rebellion allegations. The CIO has said that it can investigate Yoon’s rebellion allegation because it’s related to his purported abuse of power and other allegations. The CIO handed over Yoon’s case to the Seoul prosecutors’ office on Friday and asked it to indict him on charges of rebellion, abuse of power and obstruction of the National Assembly. Prosecutors said they indicted Yoon only on rebellion, considering that Yoon had presidential immunity from other charges. Yoon’s defense minister, police chief and several other military commanders have already been arrested on alleged rebellion, abuse of power and other charges related to the martial law decree. If the Constitutional Court rules to drive Yoon out of office, a national election to choose his successor must be held within two months. Recent public surveys show that governing and opposition party candidates are running neck-and-neck in a possible presidential by-election race.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi)       Ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon appeared at risk on Sunday as disputes continued over key deadlines, and local health officials said that Israeli forces opened fire on both fronts. In Gaza,Israel accused Hamasof violating the ceasefire there by changing the order of hostages it has released. Citing that, Israel has stopped thousands of Palestinians from returning to the northern part ofthe Gaza Stripas expected by Sunday. Local health officials said that Israeli forces fired on the crowd, killing two. Israel said civilian hostage Arbel Yehoud should have been releasedbefore the four soldiers freed on Saturday. Mediators the United States, Qatar and Egypt were working on the issue. In Lebanon, health officials said thatIsraeli forces opened fireon protesters in the south who demanded that Israel withdraw in line with the ceasefire agreement, killing at least 22. Separately, officials with Hamas and Jordan rejected U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion that most of Gaza’s populationshould be at least temporarily resettled elsewhere, including in Egypt and Jordan. The war in Gaza broke out after Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people in southern Israel in an attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and abducted around 250. Israel’s retaliatory military operation has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of thevictims childrenand women, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians. Here is the latest: RAMALLAH, West Bank — The office of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has sharply condemned U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion to “clean out” the Gaza Strip and request that Egypt and Jordan take in more Palestinians. In a statement, the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited control over parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, says the prospect of mass displacement from the Gaza Strip “constitutes a violation of the red lines that we have repeatedly warned against.” “Our people will not leave,” the statement said. “We warn of the repercussions of such a dangerous Israeli policy that contributes to severing the ties of the Gaza Strip, and displacing its people, which will lead to destabilization and security.” Trump’s remarks suggesting that Palestinians be encouraged to leave Gaza gets at the core of Palestinian fears that they will be driven from their remaining homeland. The Palestinian presidency said it was “ready to assume its full duties in the Gaza Strip” in hopes of eventually establishing an independent Palestinian state. The Palestinian Authority, based in the West Bank city of Ramallah, briefly controlled Gaza after Israeli troops withdrew in 2005, only to be driven out by its rival Hamas two years later. PARIS — France will consider allowing Israeli companies to participate in the Paris Air Show in June, thanks to ceasefire agreements in Gaza and Lebanon, the French president’s office said Sunday. That was among the results of a conversation Sunday between French President Emmanuel Macron and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Macron said France hopes to help speed up the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza, two of whom are French citizens. Macron also urged Israel to allow for a ″massive″ facilitation of aid to Gaza’s population, and to fulfill its promises to withdraw troops from Lebanon under a truce brokered by the U.S. and France. Netanyahu asked about Israeli participation in the upcoming Paris Air Show at Le Bourget, a major industry event. The French president said Israeli participation ″could be favorably considered, as a consequence of the cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon,″ according to Macron’s office. Tensions surrounded Israel’s participation in twoarms shows in Francelast year, Eurosatory and Euronaval. The French government did not want Israel displaying any weapons used in its wars in Gaza and Lebanon. RAMALLAH, West Bank — A spokesman for the Islamic Jihad, Gaza’s second-largest militant group, says the dispute over an Israeli hostage that has kept Palestinians from returning home to northern Gaza has been settled. Mohamed al-Hajj Mousa added in a statement that the group told mediators that the hostage, Arbel Yehoud, will be released before Saturday, when the next exchange of hostages from Gaza for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody is set to take place. There is no immediate comment from Israel, which has accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire by changing the order of hostages it has released. It expected Yehoud to be freed this weekend, and it has put the movement of Palestinians into northern Gaza on hold. RAMALLAH, West Bank — The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees says that if Israel carries out its threat to close its east Jerusalem headquarters on Thursday, the outsize effects will be felt acutely and immediately by tens of thousands of Palestinians. The agency, known as UNRWA, runs 12 facilities that provide critical public services across east Jerusalem, including schools enrolling at least 1,200 children and free clinics serving over 70,000 people. “That’s the thing, it has an impact on people’s lives,” Juliette Touma, a spokeswoman for UNRWA, said of the potential closure. In the Shuafat refugee camp, an impoverished neighborhood, “people today can walk just a few meters and they’re in an excellent clinic,” Touma said. But if it’s shuttered, she said, tens of thousands of Palestinians would have to cross a difficult checkpoint, pay for transport and, even if they’re eligible for Israeli primary health care, also pay for medicine in order to see a doctor or get a blood test. “We’re talking about the poorest of the poor,” Touma said. “Right now, they have no alternative.” The closure of UNRWA schools would raise all sorts of problems given that there are already too few classrooms in the overcrowded Palestinian areas of east Jerusalem, she said. Touma said much remains unclear about the Israeli order, including whether the closure would apply to operations in east Jerusalem only or to the entirety of the Palestinian territories. Israel says the agency has allowed itself to be infiltrated by Hamas, allegations denied by the U.N. TEL AVIV, Israel — Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and former National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, both want Israel to establish Jewish settlements in Gaza, supported Trump’s remarks, calling it “voluntary emigration.” Palestinians and many of their supporters view it as code for ethnic cleansing. In a post on X Sunday, Smotrich called the idea of “helping (Palestinians) find other places to start new, good lives” great and said he would work with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to that end. Ben-Gvir, who quit Netanyahu’s government over the current ceasefire in Gaza, said Trump’s remarks gave Israel the green light to move ahead on “voluntary emigration.” “When the president of the world’s largest superpower brings it up himself, the government of Israel should implement it,” he said in a statement. Netanyahu has said building Jewish settlements in Gaza is not realistic. Israel withdrew troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but maintains a blockade with Egypt on the territory. JERUSALEM — The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees says its staff was directed to vacate the premises by Thursday. Israelpassed legislation last yearcutting all ties with the agency and barring it from operating in its territory. It says the agency, which is the main provider of aid in the Gaza Strip, has allowed itself to be infiltrated by Hamas, allegations denied by the U.N. In a statement Sunday, the agency, known as UNRWA, said the order to vacate “is in contradiction to international law obligations of U.N. member states,” including Israel. “United Nations premises are inviolable and enjoy privileges and immunities under the United Nations Charter.” UNRWA closed its east Jerusalem headquarters last May after Israeli protesters set fire to its perimeter. DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Bassem Naim said that “even if seemingly well-intentioned under the guise of reconstruction,” the Palestinian people will never agree to such a proposal. He also said the Palestinians can rebuild Gaza “even better than before”if Israel lifts its blockade. DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli forces fired on the crowds on three occasions overnight and into Sunday. Those killed included a child, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel has pulled back from several areas of Gaza as part of the ceasefire, which came into force last Sunday, but the military has warned people to stay away from its forces, which are still operating in a buffer zone inside Gaza along the border and in the Netzarim corridor.

(Photo by CJ Rivera/Invision/AP)                     NEW YORK (AP) — To celebrate an upcoming milestone, Alyssa Math could think of nothing more fitting than front-row tickets to “Onyx Storm” author Rebecca Yarros’ appearance at The Town Hall in Manhattan. “I’m getting married next weekend, so this is my bachelorette party,” said Math, an accountant who traveled with friends from her home near Annapolis, Maryland. She has been one of millions of admirers of Yarros’ work and a year ago drove two hours to Reston, Virginia, to see the author. “It’s a huge cult following,” said Math, wearing a white veil in homage to one of Yarros’ characters. “The drama (of her books) keeps you on the edge of your seat.” Friday night at The Town Hall had the feel of a costume party, rock concert and family reunion as a capacity crowd of around 1,500 clapped, laughed and shouted, “Yes, Queen!” The “Empyrean” series has made Yarros one of the country’s most popular and obsessed-about leaders of romantasy, a newly branded genre combinging romance and fantasy. “Onyx Storm” is the much-awaited third installment of a planned five centered on the lovers Violet and Xaden, and the first since the million-selling “Iron Flame” came out in 2023. In its first week of publication, “Onyx Storm” has already topped the bestseller lists of Amazon and sold more than 300,000 copies just through Barnes & Noble, according to a spokesperson for the superstore chain. Yarros, interviewed for some 75 minutes by Olympic gymnast and avowed fan Laurie Hernandez, shared a few insights about her writings (she already knows how the series will end), spoke lovingly of her husband (“He’s 6'4\" and hot as hell with a baby strapped to his chest”), swore casually and joked that hers was the “only profession where you can have imaginary fiends” and not be considered insane.  She expressed relief and pleasure over completing “Onyx Storm,” noting she had to block out her own popularity to get the writing done. “As much as I love you guys, I kind of pretend you don’t exist,” she said. “I kind of ignore you, but I love you at the same time.” “Onyx Storm” isn’t quite a Harry Potter-level phenomenon — the final Potter book byJ.K. Rowling, “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” sold more than 8 million copies in the U.S. in its first 24 hours — but it carries a similar feeling of obsession, identification and spontaneity. Like the Potter books, the release of “Onyx Storm” was welcomed with midnight store parties around the country, gatherings for which fans showed up in costume. Some fans at The Town Hall finished the 526-page “Onyx Storm” within hours of receiving it, others are in no hurry. “This is a book I personally want to take my time with,” said Scarlett Fuentes, who arrived with her friend Zy Bao-angan, both of them in black leather. “I want to savor this moment,” Bao-angan said. Like Potter, enthusiasm for the Yarros books extends well beyond any organized publicity campaigns. The Potter books helped inspire some of the first Internet fan sites for books. Yarros and such fellow romantasy authors asSarah J. Maashave been favorites of the young readers on BookTok, a TikTok community that has emerged as publishing’s most effective driver of sales. Countless fans on BookTok and other social media — some crying, some cursing in amazement — have been posting their responses to “Onyx Storm.” On Friday, Hernandez and the audience posed questions about her books as if gossiping about friends. If Violet and Xaden were at a bar, what would they order? Violet would go for a lavender lemon drop, Xaden is fine with a beer. And which music genres define them? Xenon is heavy metal, Violet harder to label. Asked what was the most important lessons she has learned from writing the books, Yarros reminded her fans that she wasn’t only a writer or public figure. “I can say plotting and I can say everything, but probably the most important thing I’ve learned is that real life is what happens in my house, and what happens around my kitchenette and what happens in my living room chairs and what happens when my kids are all together and my husband’s together,” she said. “Real life is not what happens on the internet.” “I love you guys,” she added. “But peace out.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

NASA’s four Magnetospheric Multiscale, or MMS, satellites at the Astrotech Space Operations facility in Titusville, Florida, March 2015. (NASA via AP) NEW YORK (AP) — Scientists have detected cosmic waves thatsound like birds chirpingin an unexpected place. These bursts of plasma, called chorus waves, ripple at the same frequency ashuman hearing. When converted to audio signals, their sharp notes mimichigh-pitched bird calls. Researchers have captured such sounds in space before, but now they have sensed the chirping waves from much farther away: over 62,000 miles (100,000 kilometers) from Earth, where they’ve never been measured before. “That opens up a lot of new questions about the physics that could be possible in this area,” said Allison Jaynes, a space physicist at the University of Iowa who was not involved with the work. AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on scientists sensing a chirping chorus in an unexpected place. Scientists still aren’t sure how the perturbations happen, but they thinkEarth’s magnetic fieldmay have something to do with it. The chorus has been picked up on radio antennas for decades, including receivers at an Antarctica research station in the 1960s. And twin spacecraft — NASA’s Van Allen Probes — heard the chirps from Earth’s radiation belts at a closer distance than the newest detection. The latest notes were picked up by NASA’s Magnetospheric Multiscale satellites, launched in 2015 to explore the Earth and sun’s magnetic fields. The new researchwas published Wednesdayin the journal Nature. Chorus waves have also been spotted near other planets including Jupiter and Saturn. They can even produce high-energy electrons capable of scrambling satellite communications.   “They are one of the strongest and most significant waves in space,” said study author Chengming Liu from Beihang University in an email. The newfound chorus waves were detected in a region where Earth’s magnetic field is stretched out, which scientists didn’t expect. That raises fresh questions about how these chirping waves form. “It’s very captivating, very compelling,” Jaynes said. “We definitely need to find more of these events.” The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Israeli forces also remain active inside the Syrian border region as victorious rebels there build a transitional government. Tensions remain high between Israel and Iran after tit-for-tat long-range strikes in recent months and threats of further military action from both sides. The IDF and the Yemeni Houthis also continue to exchange attacks. The death toll from an attack Sunday by the Israel Defense Forces in southern Lebanon has climbed to 22, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. At least 124 people have been injured in the attack, including nine children, the health ministry said. Sunday was supposed to be the last day of a ceasefire deal that saw the IDF completely withdraw from Lebanon, but the IDF remains in several areas in the south. -ABC News' Victoria Beaule Jordanian officials have rejected President Trump's comments about Egypt and Jordan \"taking\" in more displaced Palestinians. Jordan's position \"rejecting the displacement of Palestinians is fixed and unchangeable and is necessary to achieve the stability and peace that we all want,\" Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Ayman Safadi said during a Foreign Ministry press conference on Sunday.   \"We renew our position of rejecting the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza. Our position is that the two-state solution is the way to achieve peace, and our rejection of displacement is fixed and unchangeable,\" Safadi said, stressing that \"the solution to the Palestinian issue is a Palestinian solution, and Jordan is for Jordanians and Palestine is for Palestinians.\" Safadi added, \"Our approach is clear, to establish the Palestinians in their land and implement the two-state solution.\" Safadi said a priority now is to consolidate the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and bring aid to the residents of the area. ”We are working to bring aid into Gaza without interruption in preparation for the start of reconstruction operations,\" Safadi said.

The 44-year-old single mom of three works 80-hour weeks to provide for her children, ages 8, 14, and 18. During the day, she is a driver for Pizza Hut, where she earns $9.50 an hour before tips.

Yeldell is among the millions of fast food workers across the U.S. scraping to get by. Abouttwo-thirdsof them are women, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and many are supporting their families on minimum wages set at the federal government’s floor of $7.25 an hour. Fast food workers are disproportionately Hispanic, making up 24.6% of the industry’s workforce compared with 18.8% of the overall workforce. And more than half of all U.S. fast food workers are 20 or older, “contrary to the myth of it being a teenage job that they just do for pocket money,” said Tsedeye Gebreselassie, an attorney for nonprofit advocacy organization National Employment Law Project.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)  President Donald Trump, whomanned the fry station at a McDonald’sin Pennsylvania while on the campaign trail last year, has acknowledged that the federal minimum wage is “very low” and that he would consider raising it, but that doing so would be “complicated.” Meanwhile, a growing number of states have pushed to increase their minimum wage in the face of record-high inflation in recent years. Voters in Alaska approved a ballot initiative in November that will raise the state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour from $11.73 an hour by 2027. Missouri voters likewise approved a minimum wage hike to $15 from $12.30 an hour by 2026. And California — which has one of the highest costs of living in the country — in Aprilraised wagesfor fast food workers specifically, to $20 an hour from $16 an hour.  By the end of this year, 23 states and 65 cities and counties will raise their minimum wage floors, according to a December 2024 National Employment Law Projectreportthat combed through legislation across the country.  But not Texas, where Yeldell and her family live. It isone of 20 statesat the $7.25 federal minimum wage floor and that rate hasn’t budged since 2009. Democratic lawmakers in Texas have repeatedly proposed legislation to raise the minimum wage in the state to no avail.Preemption laws, which exist in Texas and many other states, block cities and counties from adopting their own minimum wage laws, presenting another barrier. Today, a living wage for one adult raising three children in the Houston metro area is $57.65 an hour, according to MIT’s Living Wage Calculator. For Yeldell, it’s not possible to get by on her fast food job alone, which is why she must work a second job. Still wearing her visor and gray “No One Out Pizzas The Hut” shirt, she slumps sideways after a recent work shift, resting an elbow on the folding table surrounded by four folding chairs where the family eats. The living room furniture is sparse but the home is tidy. A yellow mop bucket sits near the entryway, and a small vacuum rests against the closet door. She only takes a moment to rest before changing into Looney Tunes sweatpants and a yellow T-shirt, scooping fajitas onto plates for the kids’ dinner, and packing up the leftovers. Then the teens disappear into their bedrooms, and her Minecraft pajama-clad youngest curls up next to her on the couch, playing a game on a bright red console.

But I have to, because the jobs don’t pay enough,” Yeldell said. “I would not be able to provide a roof over my kids’ head … They come first, I come second.” The Associated Press reached out to Pizza Hut, as well as its parent company, Yum Brands, for comment on wages for fast food workers but did not hear back. Wages are just one of many issues fast food workers face. Unpredictable hours, limited access to paid sick leave, and challenging customer interactions all shape their experiences, said Daniel Schneider, co-director and co-founder of the Shift Project, a joint Harvard and University of California, San Francisco project researching the conditions of service sector work. Wage theft and other law violations are also common in the industry, added labor scholar David Madland, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. “The fast food industry is notorious for low pay and poor working conditions,” Madland said. “It’s seen as the almost the sort of typical throwaway job that policy has cared very little about.” Yeldell’s Pizza Hut deliveries sometimes go until 11 p.m. She carries a knife in her pocket, as well as a flashlight, to keep her safe.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)  TiAnna Yeldell works in the kitchen at Pizza Hut, Thursday, Nov. 14, 2024, in Missouri City, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)  Despite the challenges, Yeldell maintains a positive outlook about her job, which she started about a year and a half ago as a delivery driver and has since learned to do “pretty much everything” at her Fresno, Texas store, including making pizzas, prepping ingredients, and running the register. “Pizza Hut is a really easy job and the job is only hard if you make it hard,” she said. “And I’m a fast learner, so it doesn’t bother me. The only time that it’s worrisome is when we’re slow and they say, ‘Oh, we got to cut your hours.’” Contrast Texas to California, which now has the highest fast food minimum wage of any state since lawmakers passed a minimum $20 hourly wage for those workers. Angelica Hernandez, 51, who has worked at various McDonald’s restaurants for 20 years and now works for a Monterey Park location in Los Angeles County, said the raise helped her pay rent and bills on time, avoid late fees, and buy “a bit more” at the grocery store. It’s also allowed her family the chance to go out to eat on the weekends, “which I was never able to do before, so it’s a big accomplishment what fast food workers were able to win,” she said. But Hernandez says much of the increase was swallowed by a recent $200 rent hike. “We need a little more to be able to save money and buy clothes without being tight every two weeks or have to use credit,” she said. Now, Hernandez is a member of California Fast Food Workers Union, and councilmember on the state’s Fast Food Council established bythe new California lawand aimed at improving working conditions.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)  Critics ofthe lawsay continuing to increase minimum wage is not the answer, arguing that it has raised prices and reduced job opportunities for young people, pinching franchisees in an industry with already-slim margins. “When you see a spike in operating costs pretty dramatically in a short period of time, it creates challenges,” said Jot Condie, president and CEO of the California Restaurant Association, which opposed the law. He added that franchisees, who are essentially small business owners, are most harmed. But a September report from University of California, Berkeley’s Institute for Research on Labor and Employment called the effects of the new law “benign,” and found that the policy did not affect employment adversely and increased prices about 3.7%, or about 15 cents on a $4 hamburger. For Yeldell, increasing the minimum wage in Texas “would be more fair.” ”If other states could change, y’all can change too,” she said. Her exhaustion shines through: her movements are slow, and her eyelids droop. Between her two jobs, she has no days off so her activities with the kids have to happen on the days she works at one job, not both. But she makes it happen. On a chilly Friday morning at 7 a.m., she walks her youngest to the bus stop, then drives her daughter across town to have her senior pictures done before her Pizza Hut shift starts.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)  At the photography studio, Yeldell and her daughter pose for a selfie against a backdrop that reads “Class of ’25.” Yeldell wears a sleek, royal blue dress that reads “Faith” in white cursive text, her daughter in a black cap and gown. Both women’s hair is arranged in long, elegant braids with the ends curled. “Being a mother, I do what I’m supposed to do for my kids,” she said. But for all her hard work, Yeldell says the family has little to no savings. On good months, she says she has about $100 left over. Often, she has nothing, which leaves no room for vacations, or outings with kids. “At the end of the day, I’ve worked all these hours and I really have nothing to show for it, but just paying some bills,” she said.

(Andrew Esola via AP)             ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — North America’s tallest peak is a focal point of Jeff King’s life. The four-time winner of the 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometer) Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race operates his kennel and mushing tourism business just 8 miles (12.87 kilometers) fromDenali National Park and Preserve’s entrance, and the 20,310-foot (6,190-meter) mountain looms large as he trains his dogs on nearby trails. King and many others who live in the mountain’s shadow say most Alaskans will never stop calling the peak Denali,its Alaska Native name, despitePresident Donald Trump’s executive orderthat the namerevert to Mount McKinley-- an identifier inspired byPresident William McKinley, who was from Ohio and never set foot in Alaska. For many who live near Denali, Trump’s suggestion was peculiar. “I don’t know a single person that likes the idea, and we’re pretty vocal about it,” King said. “Denali respects the Indigenous people that have been here and around Denali for tens of thousands of years.” The mountain was named after McKinleywhen a prospector walked out of the Alaska wildernessin 1896, and the first news he heard was that the Republican had been nominated for president. The name was quickly challenged, but maps had already been circulated with the mountain’s name in place. At the time, there was no recognition of the name Denali, or “the high one,” bestowed on the mountain in interior Alaska by Athabascan tribal members, who have lived in the region for centuries.  The McKinley name stuck until 2015, whenPresident Barack Obama’s administrationchanged it to Denali as a symbolic gesture to Alaska Natives on the eve of his Alaska visit tohighlight climate change. Trump said he issued the order to “restore the name of a great president, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs. President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent.” The area lies solely in the United States, and Trump, as president, has the authority to change federal geographical names within the country. In Ohio, Trump’s move drew praise. “I was really excited to see President Trump do that executive order,” former U.S. Rep. Bob Gibbs, R-Ohio, told The Associated Press by telephone Thursday. McKinley “was a great president,” Gibbs said. “It was the appropriate thing to do.” That’s not how Alaskans see it. Trump injected “a jarring note” into Alaska affairs, Steve Haycox, professor emeritus of history at the University of Alaska Anchorage, wrote inthe Anchorage Daily News. “Historical analysis confirms that William McKinley is the wrong public figure for Alaskans to commemorate,” he said. McKinley served as president from 1897 until he was assassinated in 1901. He was an imperial colonialist who oversaw the expansion of the American empire with the occupation of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Philippines andHawaii, pushed by business interests and Christian missionaries wanting to convert Indigenous peoples, Haycox said. “Trump’s push to rescind the name Denali for the colonialist and white elitist McKinley is insulting to all Alaskans, especially to Alaska’s Native people, and should be soundly rejected,” Haycox said. John Wayne Howe, who unsuccessfully ran for U.S. House last year representing the Alaskan Independence Party, which holds that Alaskans should be allowed to vote on becoming an independent nation, said he is tired of “people changing the names of stuff, period.” He also is not in favor of naming anything after people because “the persons that we consider absolutely perfect change over time, and it just leads to confusion.” Howe said he prefers Denali because he knows McKinley’s history and it’s the name most preferred by Alaskans. This past week, two resolutions were introduced in the Alaska Legislature to keep the name Denali. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Trump ally who praised another order by the president aimed at spurring resource development in the state, said he had not had a chance to speak with Trump about the issue but hoped to have a conversation next month in Washington about what Denali means to Alaskans, Americans and “our Native folks.” But Sarah Palin, a former Republican governor who is also a Trump supporter, said the McKinley name should never have been removed. Palin’s Secret Service code name was Denali in 2008 when she was GOP presidential nominee John McCain’s running mate the year they lost to Obama and Joe Biden. But in an interview with Al Arabiya News this past week, Palin said she didn’t see why the mountain’s name needed to be changed to begin with. “It’s always been Mount McKinley,” said Palin, who didn’t respond to a message from The Associated Press. “Nobody was begging for a change in name in that peak. Just put it back the way it was, more common sense.” Alaska’s U.S. senators, Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, have supported the name Denali. U.S. Rep. Nick Begich, a first-term Republican, sidestepped the debate. “I’m focused on job creation, opportunities in Alaska,” Begich told Politico. “And what we call a mountain in Alaska is of little concern to me.” The Alaska Native Heritage Center, the statewide Indigenous cultural center in Anchorage, supports preserving Indigenous place names. “Restoring and honoring them acknowledges the deep, millennia-old connection Indigenous peoples maintain with these lands and is a step toward respect and reconciliation,” the center’s president, Emily Edenshaw, said in a statement. The quirky Alaska community of Talkeetna, about 140 miles (225.3 kilometers) south of the park and wherea cat was once mayor, is the jumping off point for climbers before making the ascent of the peak. The historic community long rumored to be the inspiration for the 1990s television series “Northern Exposure” is also a popular tourist stop. Joe McAneney of Talkeetna worked as a summer raft-guide for two years before moving to Alaska full time in 2012. He’s now a pilot for an air taxi company, ferrying climbers and tourists to the mountain in a small airplane outfitted with skis to land atbase camp, located on Kahiltna Glacierat 7,200 feet (2,194.6 meters) above sea level. He knows once tourist season comes around, he will have to answer their questions of what he thinks about Trump changing the name. He knows what his answer will be. “It’s always been Denali, and it always will be,” he said. The executive order can instigate the name change, but compliance is another issue. “The only people that are going to adhere to that are probably the people that would have been still calling it McKinley anyway,” McAneney said There is a long-standing Alaska trait of ignoring what the rest of the world thinks, and it’s usually expressed like this: “We don’t care how they do it Outside.” Outside, which is always capitalized, refers to every place that is not Alaska. “I think unofficially and officially in Alaska, it’ll always be Denali,” McAneney said. “I don’t think the president can change that.” For King, the decorated Iditarod musher and fan favorite, Trump’s decision had a whiff of arrogance. “I’m surprised he doesn’t want to name it Trump Mountain,” he said.

        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "Researchers say they are puzzled over the discovery. Astronomers have detected fast-repeating radio bursts from a distant \"dead\" galaxy that should not contain the energy to produce these types of signals, according to new research. The source of the fast radio bursts (FRBs) -- sudden flashes of radio waves that last just milliseconds -- has previously been linked to young, magnetized neutron stars that expend a lot of energy when they are forming. But the dormant galaxy from which these radio bursts are originating should not contain this type of young star, according to a paper published Wednesday inThe Astrophysical Journal Letters. Researchers expect FRBs to originate inside of a galaxy and, because these FRBs are so energetic, within a region of a galaxy in which new stars are actively forming, Vishwangi Shah, a PhD student in the Department of Physics and the Trottier Space Institute at McGill University, told ABC News. These FRBs, named FRB 20240209A, are located outside of the massive ancient elliptical galaxy it is associated with that only contains old and dead stars, Shah said. \"This discovery was really surprising and exciting,\" she said. Shah and her team used the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment -- also known as the CHIME telescope -- to detect the multiple bursts from the same location, Shah said. But because the CHIME telescope could not pinpoint the exact location of the radio waves, they combined it with a smaller CHIME-like telescope to pinpoint the location of the FRB. They then used the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii to image the region around the location of the FRBs. The Gemini image confirmed that there is no other galaxy present near the FRB and the FRB is indeed associated with the dead galaxy. \"There's no other galaxy there,\" Shah said. The ancient elliptical galaxy where astronomers discovered the radio waves is about 2 billion light-years from Earth and is about 11.3 billion years old, according to the paper. Thousands of radio bursts have been recorded since 2007, when they were first discovered by astronomers, Shah said, adding that they only know the precise locations of about 100 of them -- all near actively forming stars. \"This particular FRB is really an outlier, and it challenges our theories about what is producing FRBs,\" Shah said. Astronomers hypothesize that the FRBs could be originating from two supernova remnants, called neutron stars, that are merging or collapsing onto themselves, Shah said. Continuing to study these FRBs will allow researchers to further understand the space between its origination and the Milky Way as well as what is happening in distant regions of space, Shah said. \"That is why it is a really useful probe of our universe,\" she said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)                 PARK CITY, Utah (AP) —Rose Byrneplays a mother in the midst of a breakdown in the experiential psychological thriller “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You.” Anticipation was high for the A24 film, which will be released sometime this year. Its premiere Friday at theSundance Film Festivalwas easily the hottest ticket in town, with even ticketholders unable to get in. Those who did make it into the Library theater were treated to an intense, visceral, inventive story from filmmaker Mary Bronstein that has quickly become one of the festival’s must-sees. Byrne plays Linda, who is barely hanging on while managing her daughter’s mysterious illness. She’s faced with crisis after crisis, big and small — from the massive, gaping hole in their apartment ceiling that forces them to move to a dingy motel, to an escalating showdown with a parking attendant at a care center. The cracks in her psychological, emotional and physical wellbeing are become too much to bear. “I’d never seen a movie before where a mother is going through a crisis with a child but our energy is not with the child’s struggle, it’s with the mother’s,” Bronstein said at the premiere. “If you’re a caretaker, you shouldn’t be bothering with yourself at all. It should all be about the person you’re taking care of, right? And that is a particular kind of emotional burnout state that I was really interested in exploring.” Byrne and Bronstein went deep in the preparation phase, having long discussions about Linda with the goal of making her as real as possible before the quick, 27-day shoot. Byrne said she was obsessed with figuring out who Linda was before the crisis. The film was in part inspired by Bronstein’s experience with her own daughter, but she didn’t want to elaborate on the specifics.  “That’s her story to tell,” Bronstein said. Part of Linda’s story involves her therapist, played byConan O’Brien, who joked that he didn’t realize he was in a movie. “I’m not looking out for movie scripts or anything. But when I got a call from A24 that they wanted me to read something, I’m not stupid,” O’Brien said. “I showed it to my wife, who is one of the smartest people I know, and she read through it and she said, ‘I didn’t know they made movies like this anymore.’” He was particularly in awe of his director and co-star, saying he felt like a fraud standing beside them. “It was an amazing experience, one of the best experiences of my life, just to be with them and watch them work,” O’Brien said. “I don’t know how (Byrne) did that and not check into a hospital afterwards, because I haven’t seen any actor, man or woman, sustain that level for an entire movie.” “I feel like I have to go to a hospital now, because this was the first time I watched it,” he added. “I’m a mess.” A$AP Rockyalso co-stars, as a man Linda meets at the motel, but was not in Park City for the premiere. He is currentlyon trial, charged with firing a gun at a former friend. The film is full of ambiguity, metaphor and just plain artistic expression that Bronstein hesitated to explain, from the name itself to the hole in the ceiling, which takes on a somewhat supernatural quality. “When we have nothing left to give, we have an emptiness inside of us,” Bronstein said. “And that emptiness is actually not empty: It’s filled with all the darkness and self-hate and doubt and fear and dread and regret and everything. … That to me is what the hole is.” Some of it, she said, she doesn’t even fully understand. The point is the experience, and critics and Sundance audiences are already fully on board. Bronstein, a bit of a cult figure in the film world, made her directorial debut in 2008 at the SXSW festival with “Yeast,” which featured a pre-fame Greta Gerwig and was hailed by by New Yorker critic Richard Brody as a “mumblecore classic.” “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” is only her second feature. “This is the first time that anybody else has paid for me to make art,” Bronstein said. “I’m proud to say that this is the film that came directly from my head to the screen.” For more coverage of the 2025 Sundance Film Festival, visit:https://apnews.com/hub/sundance-film-festival   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)              LAS VEGAS (AP) — PresidentDonald Trumpcame to Las Vegas on Saturday to crow about his campaign promise to eliminate taxes on tips, signaling to allies in Congress the importance of the policy but stopping well short of offering details for making the slogan a reality. Instead, Trump spent most of his 40 minutes speaking to roughly 1,000 supporters in a casino ballroom lauding his November election victory, mocking former President Joe Biden’s administration and touting his torrent of executive actions since taking office Monday. “But I have to be honest with you, I’m really here for a different reason, I’m here to say thank you,” Trump told the crowd at Circa Resort & Casino. The victory lap, Trump’s first swing-state rally since taking office, came after he won Nevada’s six electoral votes in November, becoming the first Republican since George W. Bush in 2004 to carry the state. It was part of Trump’s sweep of all seven of the most competitive states that gave him a healthy electoral majority and a second, non-consecutive term. AP correspondent Julie Walker reports President Trump leans into his pledge to eliminate taxes on tips. Aides said Trump’s stop in Nevada was to deliver an “economic-focused message” built around his familiar promise to hospitality industry workers to remove the tax on gratuity income. “We’re going to get it for you — ‘no tax on tips,’” Trump said, standing behind a podium emblazoned with the same slogan he used throughout the 2024 campaign.  After the rally, Trump strode through the Circa casino floor past its purple-hewed velvet tables, to cheers from visitors of “USA, USA.” At a roulette table, a player yelled, “Give me $47 on 47,” for Trump, now the 47th president. “Ohh,” Trump lamented at the losing throw but he signed autographs as supporters hooted. If light on detail, Trump’s comments on tips were a signal to Republicans in Congress that the proposal is a priority for the massive tax package they intend to pass this year. Trump is set to meet House Republicans on Monday as they gather in Florida to chart the strategy ahead. Speaker Mike Johnson, who is laboring to get the package moving forward, invited Trump to address a joint session of Congress on March 4, a tradition for new presidents, who don’t deliver a State of the Union address until their second year in office. Johnson said lawmakers working with Trump hope to make the next four years “some of the most consequential in our nation’s history.” Nevada is a familiar backdrop to talk tips and taxation. As a candidate, Trump first announced the idea of ending gratuity taxes during a rally in June in Las Vegas — aproposal later copiedby his Democratic opponent,Kamala Harris. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates there are 2.24 million restaurant servers across the country, with tips making up a large percentage of their income. In Las Vegas, the 24-hour economy is fueled by everyone from wait staff and valet parkers to hotel maids and casino dealers, all of whom collect tips. Nevada has the nation’s highest concentration of tipped workers, with about 25.8 waiters and waitresses alone per 1,000 jobs, followed by Hawaii and Florida. Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer for the Culinary Union, which represents about 60,000 hospitality workers across Nevada, said Trump’s plans “must not end” with scrapping taxation on tips. “Eliminating taxes on tips and ending the $2.13 sub-minimum wage — that is the reality in too many states across the country — will uplift millions of hospitality workers,” Pappageorge said. He said many employers set hourly pay well below the federal minimum wage and expect gratuities to make up the difference. Despite the stated focus on taxes, the Nevada rally served mostly as a capstone of sorts to Trump’s first week in office, as he recounted for the crowd the executive orders he’d signed and what they’ll do. “We’ve accomplished more in one week than most administrations have experienced in four years and we’re just getting started,” Trump said, adding that his executive orders “reverse the horrible failures and betrayals that we inherited from a group of people that didn’t know what the hell they were doing.” Trump cited a sweeping freeze on new money for all U.S. foreign assistance, his notice of a U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and his order ceasing diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the federal government, among other things. “We feel a light over our country,” Trump said. ”Everyone does.” Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

In an interview with ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz, Homan said that only days after Trump took office, the U.S. government for the first time ever used military aircraft to transport migrants back to their home country, and it will now be a daily occurrence. According to U.S. officials, the U.S. military on Thursday flew more than 150 migrants to Guatemala on two separate flights. But Homan made clear that the military flights are just one part of a much broader plan. He claimed that – unlike under the Biden administration –Immigrationand Customs Enforcement officers are now free to arrest any of the estimated more than 11 million immigrants in the country without legal status, not just those identified as priorities for deportation for being convicted criminals or other public safety threats. Watch more of Martha Raddatz' interview with Tom Homan Sunday on ABC's 'This Week' \"If you're in the country illegally, you're on the table because it's not okay to, you know, violate the laws of this country,\" he said. Homan said that while the Trump administration's enforcement actions are currently prioritizing public safety and national security threats, they're going to \"open up the aperture\" in the weeks and months ahead. \"As that aperture opens, there'll be more arrests nationwide,\" he said. Homan also offered another possible solution for \"those who are in the country illegally\": They \"should leave\" on their own, he said. Early in the Biden administration, then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas issued guidance to immigration enforcement officers discouraging them from \"spending resources to remove those who do not pose a threat\" and noting that many undocumented immigrants inside the country \"have been here for generations and contributed to our country's well-being,\" as he put it in a statement at the time. Homan, however, noted that the nation’s immigration laws were passed by Congress to be enforced, and said immigrants without legal status are violating those laws.

(AP Photo/Marta Lavandier)           Dearica Hamby still smiles at the memory of Kobe Bryant sitting courtside at WNBA games. She had met him years ago. He came to see her old team, the Las Vegas Aces, play all the time. “I think one of the first things he told me was that I could play defense,” Hamby recalled. “And I was kind of like ‘Wha-at?’ ... That’s something I’ll cherish with me forever.” That epitomized the late NBA great’s relationship with the women’s game. After his 20-year playing career ended, Bryant turned his focus to the next generation, mentoring some of women’s basketball’s biggest stars, from WNBA champion and Olympic gold medalist Diana Taurasi to former Oregon star Sabrina Ionescu. He worked out with them, analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of their game and pushed for them to reach the same heights in popularity that he and his NBA peers did. For Hamby, now with the Los Angeles Sparks, Bryant saw an aspect of her game she didn’t even know she had. “If Kobe tells you you can play defense, you can play defense,” she quipped. Five years after Bryant, 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven otherswere killed in a helicopter crashin Calabasas, California, several women’s basketball players reflected on what he meant to their game and how he championed it. Many of them thought Bryant would be pleased with the overall progress of women’s sports, which haveskyrocketed in popularity and reachin recent years. That growth has been most prominent in the women’s basketball arenas that Bryant and Gianna loved so much.  The WNBA last season had its most-watched regular season in 24 years and its best attendance in 22 seasons. Some of the league’s most popular players currently are competing in a new3-on-3 leaguein South Florida called Unrivaled, founded by Olympic gold medalists Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart. “We carry this on for him,” said Satou Sabally, a forward with the WNBA’s Dallas Wings who plays for the Phantom squad in Unrivaled. “He would be so proud of this league. He would be proud of ’Phe and Stewie. I know that he’s looking down and hopefully he’s smiling and is proud of us.” Sabally said she still gets emotional when she thinks of that day on Jan. 26, 2020. It reminds her of her playing days at Oregon, when she, Ionescu and their Ducks teammates connected over Bryant. “I think about ... how we all bonded together over Kobe and how we bonded together for the rest of our lives because he was so impactful,” Sabally added. “He was really a person that saw us women as the talents who we are. He came to the games, he was so outspoken and he really was really supportive.” The shock of the superstar’s death echoed throughout the sports and entertainment worlds, with many taking to social media to post emotional tributes to Bryant while expressing their disbelief. People were glued to their phones and TV screens as news of the crash spread. NBA players were in tears ahead of games that day. “I still remember exactly where I was whenever we heard the news,” said Kate Martin of the Golden State Valkyries, playing for Laces BC at Unrivaled, “and no one really knew if it was fake or real. I think that’s just one of those things where you’re just always going to remember exactly where you were when you heard that.” Martin never met Bryant but said she cherishes his mentality — he had a relentless competitiveness — and the way he elevated women’s sports. Bryant became heavily involved with his daughters’ hoops journeys and coached Gianna’s youth team. He was often at women’s basketball games, especially college ones, with Gianna, who was fascinated with the UConn Huskies. Gianna was in line to further Bryant’s legacy on the court. The plan was for her to attend Connecticut, and surely the WNBA was next. Bryant was passionate about women’s sports despite the belief of some that he should not have been involved with the women’s game at all because of a 2003 charge accusing him of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old employee at a Colorado resort. Bryant had said the two had consensual sex, and the charge was eventually dropped when the woman declined to testify at trial. The woman later filed a civil suit against Bryant that was settled out of court. There’s an image that still circulates in the sports world today: Kobe and Gianna sitting courtside at a 2019 game featuring his Los Angeles Lakers. He wore a bright orange pullover with a white WNBA logo on the front. Gianna sat beaming at his side. “I think a lot of people started to follow behind Kobe because he recognized our gift and our talent and how special it really is,” said former Chicago Sky head coach Teresa Weatherspoon, the current coach of Unrivaled’s Vinyl BC. “And his daughter was right there as well.” That’s who Bryant had become — a face of women’s sports advocacy. “He’s greatly missed,” Martin said. “But now his legacy will live on forever.” AP WNBA:https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "The Democratic senator also said Tulsi Gabbard isn't qualified to serve as DNI. Michigan Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin explained why she voted against confirming Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense on ABC News' \"This Week\" on Sunday, saying she had not been confident Hegseth would be more loyal to the Constitution than he would be to President Donald Trump.. Hegseth, a former Fox News host, was sworn into the role on Saturday following a razor-thin vote in the Senate. Slotkin, who joined the Senate in January and previously worked for multiple national security agencies, including the Department of Defense, told \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz that it was important in confirmation hearings that nominees knew they were \"raising your right hand and pledging an oath to the Constitution -- not Donald Trump -- and that if Donald Trump asks you to do something that contravenes the Constitution, you would push back.\" \"He couldn't unambiguously say that he will push back if the president asked him to do something that wasn't constitutional, and that, to me, is why I couldn't confirm him,\" Slotkin said. \"There's a lot of other things in his background I don't like, but I look at what is the strategic and irreversible threats to our democracy, and that's using the uniform military in ways that violate the Constitution.\" The vote to confirm Hegseth was initially 50-50 until Vice President JD Vance, in his role as president of the Senate, cast the tie-breaking vote. Every Democrat voted against Hegseth's confirmation, as did Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. His nomination process was marred by accusations ofsexual misconduct, excessive drinking and financial mismanagement of two different veterans organizations. He hasdeniedall the allegations. During Hegseth's confirmation hearing, Slotkin questioned him on whether he supports active-duty military members supporting immigrant detention centers if ordered to do so by Trump. With 1,500 soldiers and Marines now at or deploying to the border, Slotkin stressed on \"This Week\" that the military should not take on a law enforcement role in this new mission. \"According to our Constitution, you can go in supporting roles -- logistics, driving, setting up facilities, setting up, you know, border locations, whatever -- it's very different when you cross the line into law enforcement,\" she said. \"Our military are not trained as law enforcement officers -- they'll be the first one to tell you that. That's not why they got into service, and it's also in violation of our Constitution, so I think it's very important that we keep that line.\" Slotkin said it was important to know \"you're not going to use the uniform military in ways that violates the Constitution and makes American citizens scared of their own military.\" \"We were scared of the British when they occupied us,\" she said. \"We don't want to repeat that, so I'm watching that very, very closely.\" Slotkin also spoke about Tulsi Gabbard's upcoming confirmation hearing for the role of director of national intelligence. Slotkin was one of the first employees in the director's office, working there between 2005 and 2006 in between stints at the CIA as an analyst. \"I served with Tulsi Gabbard. We were on the Armed Services Committee together. She didn't spend a lot of time showing up to hearings, so I didn't get to see her in action all that much,\" Slotkin said. \"But from what I understand from people who have been meeting directly with her -- and she hasn't asked to meet with me -- is that she doesn't show the competence, the understanding, the depth. She wasn't prepared for her meetings, not to mention the deeply questionable decisions she's made of cozying up to [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, flying and cozying up with Assad in Syria.\" Slotkin said she does \"not believe [Gabbard] is qualified for this role.\" \"You know, having someone in charge of our intelligence organization that shows a preference for our adversaries, to me, is just right off the bat, a deep question,\" Slotkin said. \"And so again, I hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who now have control of the Senate, control of the House, that they think about, again, their commitment to the country, not to any one party.\" Gabbard's confirmation hearing is scheduled for Thursday before the Senate Intelligence Committee. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "content": "Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote Friday. Pete Hegseth was sworn in to lead the Department of Defense on Saturday, after a narrow vote in the Senate. The vote on Friday night was initially 50-50, with Vice President JD Vance then casting the tie-breaking vote. Former GOP leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, voted no. He joined Sens. Susan Collins, of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, along with all Democrats in voting against Hegseth's nomination. The former Fox News host was sworn in at the White House on Saturday morning during a ceremony officiated by Vance. \"We look forward to having the backs of our troops and having your back in executing peace through strength, in putting America first. And in rebuilding our military,” Hegseth said in remarks at the ceremony, thanking Vance and President Donald Trump. In an official statement to the department, he said: \"It is the privilege of a lifetime to lead the warriors of the Department of Defense, under the leadership of our Commander in Chief Donald J. Trump. We will put America First, and we will never back down.\" Hegseth, a former\"Fox and Friends\" television anchor, was nominated by Trump in November to lead the Defense Department. In the time since his nomination was announced, Hegseth has beenscrutinized for a number of accusationsmade against him, including those of sexual assault and financial mismanagement of two different veterans organizations. Hegseth has fiercely deniedthe allegations. He appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee for a public hearing earlier this month, where he asserted to the panel that he was a \"changed man.\" \"I am not a perfect person, but redemption is real,\" he told the panel. Speaking to reporters while on a visit to Los Angeles, Trump said he was \"very happy\" with the vote, and said he was not aware of McConnell's vote. In a statement released while the vote was still going on, McConnell said that Hegseth's desire to be a \"change agent\" was not enough to qualify him for the role of secretary of defense. \"Effective management of nearly 3 million military and civilian personnel, an annual budget of nearly $1 trillion, and alliances and partnerships around the world is a daily test with staggering consequences for the security of the American people and our global interests,\" McConnell said in the statement. \"Mr. Hegseth has failed, as yet, to demonstrate that he will pass this test. But as he assumes office, the consequences of failure are as high as they have ever been.\" Hegseth was confirmed by one of the narrowest Senate margins of any defense secretary in modern history. Most defense secretaries have been confirmed with broad bipartisan votes. Lloyd Austin, former President Joe Biden's pick for defense secretary, was confirmed in a93-2 voteand Trump's first pick for defense secretary in his first term, James Mattis, was confirmed in a98-1 vote. Before the vote, Hegseth arrived at the Capitol with his wife and children to watch the proceedings in person, a rare move for a Cabinet nominee. With the Senate's vote Friday, Hegseth becomes the third member of Trump's team to be confirmed by the Senate, following Marco Rubio as secretary of state and John Ratcliffe, as CIA director. During the same hearing, he affirmed his promise to restore the \"warfighting ethos\" of the DOD, touting his experience in the National Guard. It was enough to win over the support of most Republicans in the Senate, including several of those who were initially skeptical. \"He articulated a clear vision of the Pentagon, and it was clear to anyone who listened that he is going to bring energy and fresh ideas to shake up the department's stagnant bureaucracy,\" Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a floor speech endorsing Hegseth on Thursday. \"He will restore a warfighting ethos and relentlessly focused on the military's core mission: to deter conflict and, if necessary, to win a war.\" The Senate Armed Services Committee advanced his nomination on a party-line vote on Monday. Then, in a closely watched moment on Thursday, Hegseth's nomination passed a key test vote that set the table for Friday's vote of final passage. The nomination only required a simple majority in the Senate to advance, and it cleared the threshold narrowly, with only GOP backing. Collins and Murkowski also voted no on that occasion. In a statement, Murkowski explained that she could not support Hegseth due to concerns about this character and lack of experience. \"I believe that character is the defining trait required of the Secretary of Defense and must be prioritized without compromise,\" Murkowski said in the post. \"The leader of the Department of Defense must demonstrate and model the standards of behavior and character we expect of all servicemembers, and Mr. Hegseth's nomination to the role poses significant concerns that I cannot overlook.\" Collins took issue with comments Hegseth made in the past about his belief that women should not serve in combat roles in the military. Though Hegseth has since changed his tune on that, Collins said she was unconvinced. \"I am also concerned about multiple statements, including some in the months just before he was nominated, that Mr. Hegseth has made about women serving in the military,\" Collins said. \"He and I had a candid conversation in December about his past statements and apparently evolving views. I am not convinced that his position on women serving in combat roles has changed.\" Trump expressed confidence in Hegseth ahead of the vote on Friday, though he added, \"You'll never know what's going to happen.\" McConnell, the former GOP leader, and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, ultimately cast votes in favor of advancing Hegseth's nomination in the earlier test vote, although the presidentquestioned whether McConnell will vote noon Hegseth Friday morning. Tillis said he was still considering the most recent slate of allegations against Hegseth, leveled in an affidavit from his former sister-in-law Danielle Hegseth. In that affidavit,which ABC News obtained, Danielle Hegseth attested that Pete Hegseth's ex-wife Samantha told her she \"once hid in her closet from him because she feared for her personal safety\" in the home they shared during their marriage. It also detailed episodes of binge drinking by Pete Hegseth. An attorney for Pete Hegseth denied these allegations, and the claims of abuse were also rejected by his ex-wife. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(AP Photo/Ben Curtis)           WASHINGTON (AP) —President Donald Trump’sfirst week in office isn’t over yet, but already itoffers signalsabout how his next four years in the White House may unfold. Some takeaways from the earliest days of his second term: Within hours of being sworn in, Trumppardoned more than 1,500people who were convicted or charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by his supporters. Those pardonedinclude people who attacked, bloodied and beat police officers that day. The Republican president’s decision was at odds with earlier comments by his incoming vice president, JD Vance, and other senior aides that Trump would only let off those who weren’t violent. The pardons were the first of many moves he made in his first week to reward allies and punish critics, in both significant and subtle ways. It signaled that without the need to worry about reelection — the Constitution bars a third term — or legal consequences after the Supreme Court granted presidents expansive immunity, the new president, backed by a Republican Congress, has little to restrain him. Trump ended protective security details forDr. Anthony Fauci, his former COVID-19 adviser, along with former national security adviser John Bolton, formerSecretary of State Mike Pompeoand his onetime deputy. The security protections had been regularly extended by the Biden administration over credible threats to the men’s lives. Trump alsorevokedthe security clearances of dozens of former government officials who had criticized him, including Bolton, and directed that the portrait of a former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, retired Gen. Mark Milley be removed from the Pentagon walls.  In his first days in office, Trump demonstrated just how much he and his team had learned from four often-chaotic years in the White House and four more in political exile. A president’s most valuable resource is time and Trump set out in his first hours to make his mark on the nation with executive orders, policy memoranda and government staffing shake-ups. It reflected a level of sophistication that eluded him in his first term and surpassed his Democratic predecessors in its scale and scope for their opening days in the Oval Office. Feeling burned by the holdover of Obama administration appointees during his first go-around, Trumpswiftly exiledBiden holdovers and moved to test new hires for their fealty to his agenda. In a matter of days heuprooted four yearsof diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the federal government, sent federal troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and erased Biden’s guardrails on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency development. In his first term, Trump’s early executive orders were more showpieces than substance and frequently were blocked by federal courts. This time, Trump is still confronting the limits of his constitutional authorities, but is also far more adept at controlling what is within them. An hour after concluding a relatively sedate inaugural address in the Capitol Rotunda, Trump decided to let loose. Speaking to an overflow crowd of governors, political supports and dignitaries in the Capitol Visitor Center’s Emancipation Hall, Trump ripped in to Biden, the Justice Department and other perceived rivals. He followed it up with an even longer speech to supporters at a downtown arena and in more than 50 minutes of remarks and questions and answers with reporters in the Oval Office. For all of Trump’s experience and organization, he is still very much the same Donald Trump, and just as intent as before on dominating the center of the national conversation. If not more. He has acted to try to end civil service protections for many federal workers andoverturn more than a century of lawon birthright citizenship. Such moves have been a magnet for legal challenges. In the case of the birthright citizenship order, it met swift criticism from U.S. District Judge John Coughenour, who put a temporary stay on Trump’s plans. “I’ve been on the bench for over four decades. I can’t remember another case where the question presented was as clear as this one is,” Coughenour, who was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan, told a Justice Department attorney. “This is a blatantly unconstitutional order.” How those court cases play out will determine not only the fate of some of Trump’s most controversial actions, but just how far any president can go in pushing an agenda. The president likes to call it “liquid gold.” His main economic assumption is that more oil production by the United States, the Saudis and the rest of OPEC would bring down prices. That would reduce overall inflation and cut down on the oil revenues that Russia is using to fund its war in Ukraine. For Trump, oil is the answer. He’s betting that fossil fuels are the future, despite the climate change risks. “The United States has the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth, and we’re going to use it,” Trump said in a Thursday speech. “Not only will this reduce the cost of virtually all goods and services, it’ll make the United States a manufacturing superpower and the world capital of artificial intelligence and crypto” Trump had theworld’s wealthiest menbehind him on the dais when he took the oath of office on Monday. Tesla’s Elon Musk, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and LVMH’s Bernard Arnault were all there. SoftBank billionaire Masayoshi Son was in the audience. Later in the week, Oracle’s Larry Ellison and OpenAI’s Sam Altman appeared with Son at the White House to announce an artificial intelligence investment of up to $500 billion. Musk, the Trump backer who is leading the president’s Department of Government Efficiency effort, posted on X that SoftBank didn’t have the money. Altman, a rival to to Musk on AI, responded over X that the funding was there. By surrounding himself with the wealthiest people in tech, Trump is also stuck in their drama. “The people in the deal are very, very smart people,” Trump said Thursday. “But Elon, one of the people, he happens to hate. But I have certain hatreds of people, too.” America’s 25th president has a big fan in Trump. Trump likes the tariffs that were imposed during Republican William McKinley’s presidency and helped to fund the government. Trump has claimed the country was its wealthiest in the 1890s when McKinley was in office. But McKinley might not be a great economic role model for the 21st century. For starters, the Tax Foundation found that federal receipts were equal to just 3% of the overall economy in 1900, McKinley’s reelection year. Tax revenues are now equal to about 17% of the U.S. economy and that’s still not enough to fund the government without running massive deficits. So it would be hard to go full McKinley without some chaos. As Dartmouth College economist Douglas Irwin noted on X, the economic era defined by McKinley was not that great for many people. “There was a little something called the Panic of 1893 and the unemployment rate was in double digits from 1894-98!!” Irwin wrote. “Not a great decade!”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

        "content": "The 17-year-old allegedly shot two classmates at his Nashville school this week. A teenager who opened fire with a 9 mm pistolin his Nashville high school cafeteriafired a total of 10 shots within 17 seconds of entering the room, according to police. Solomon Henderson, 17, had gone into a bathroom and posted photos to social media just before he went to the cafeteria and opened fire, police said. Henderson shot and killed 16-year-old Josselin Corea Escalante and shot and wounded a 17-year-old boy at Antioch High School around 11 a.m. Wednesday, according to police. Henderson died in the cafeteria from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, police said. The injured boy suffered a graze wound and was treated and released, police said. Authorities are still investigating how Henderson obtained the pistol, Nashville police said Thursday. The gun was purchased in Arizona in 2022 and was not reported stolen, police said. No firearms or firearm parts were found during Wednesday's search of Henderson's home, according to authorities. Authorities are now scouring Henderson's writings and social media presence as they investigate his ideological influences. A Pinterest account linked to Henderson features photos of past school shooters, including the shooters from Parkland, Florida, and Uvalde, Texas, a source told ABC News. Henderson's social media presence also shows he may have been in contact with 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow, whocarried out a shooting at the Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin,last month, according to law enforcement sources. Rupnow, who went by Samantha, also died after the shooting, in which two were killed and several wounded. Rupnow's account may have been following Henderson's account at the time of the Wisconsin shooting in December, according to law enforcement sources. It appears Henderson had two documents on \"non-traditional websites, one 51 pages in length, the other 288 pages,\" police said. The 51-page document expressed violent white supremacist beliefs, sources told ABC News. He expressed self-hatred as a Black person, and he wrote of wishing violence on other Black people. He also expressed violent hatred toward Jews and used antisemitic tropes and conspiracy theories to express his views, according to the sources. Henderson appeared to support neo-Nazi accelerationist and violent incel beliefs and expressed a desire to see genocide committed against racial and religious minorities, according to sources. He belonged to online communities that promote violence and extremism, sources said, and some people in those groups publicly identified Henderson as the school shooter long before his identity was confirmed by authorities.

        "content": "Homan says administration has a “clear” message for undocumented immigrants. For the first time in U.S. history, military aircraft were used this past week to deport scores of undocumented migrants from the United States. Middle schools, Trump administration officials say, are now seen as places to target for immigration enforcement operations. And, according to President Trump's \"border czar,\" every undocumented immigrant should worry they could be arrested at any time, even if they have no criminal record. The \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, says it's all part of the Trump administration's effort to send a \"clear\" message: \"There's consequences [for] entering the country illegally,\" he told ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz on Sunday. \"If we don't show there's consequences, you're never going to fix the border problem,\" he said. More than 11 million undocumented immigrants are currently estimated to be living in the U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to take unprecedented action to remove as many of them as possible and stem the flow of more migrants coming to the southern border. In his first several days in office, Trump declared a national emergency at the border, announced an end to the so-called practice of \"catch and release\" -- when migrants claiming asylum are given court dates and then released pending those proceedings -- and sought to overturn the long-held Constitutional right of birthright citizenship, a move that immediately faced legal challenges and was at least temporarily blocked by a federal judge. As for the millions of undocumented immigrants already in the country, Homan said the administration will deport \"as many as we can,\" starting with threats to public safety threats and national security, Homan said. According to estimates released by House Republicans last year, based on government data, hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants in the country are convicted criminals or have charges pending against them. Government statistics indicate that in the past four years, hundreds of migrants were caught along the southern border with names matching known or suspected terrorists on a government watchlist. And Homan has said more than 2 million people were detected along the border but never captured, so authorities don't know who they are or what threat some of them could pose. According to statistics released by the Department of Homeland Security last year, a tiny fraction of those who reached U.S. borders in the prior three years had any kind of criminal record, and the vast majority of them involved nonviolent crimes, such as driving under the influence or previously entering the country illegally. Homan told ABC News that the Trump administration is only \"in the beginning stages\" of carrying out its mass deportation plan, making public safety threats and national security threats a \"priority,\" but \"as that aperture opens, there'll be more arrests nationwide.\" And he warned that there will be \"collateral arrests,\" especially in the so-called \"sanctuary cities\" that he says are resistant to helpingImmigrationand Customs Enforcement officials locate and arrest undocumented immigrants already in local custody for other crimes. \"Sanctuary cities lock us out of the jails,\" said Homan, who led ICE as acting director in Trump's first administration. According to Homan, that creates significant safety concerns: When an undocumented immigrant arrested for a serious crime is released by local authorities, instead of being deported, it \"endangers the community.\" Nevertheless, Homan said that's a time when ICE officers would likely make \"collateral arrests.\" \"When we find him, he's going to be with others … [and] if they're in the country illegally, they're coming too,\" he said. He emphasized that anyone in the country unlawfully is \"on the table.\" \"It's not OK to violate the laws of this country,\" he said. \"We have millions of people standing in line, taking the test, doing their background investigation, paying the fees that want to come in the right way.\" \"So if you're in the country illegally, you got a problem,\" he said. On Monday, during Trump's first day in office, acting Homeland Security Secretary Benjamine Huffman issued a directive telling immigration authorities they could conduct operations in so-called \"sensitive\" areas that he said were off-limits during the Biden administration. \"Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America's schools and churches to avoid arrest,\" he said in a statement. Others, however, said the administration was simply creating fear within the immigrant community, with the chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on Migration saying that \"turning places of care, healing and solace into places of fear and uncertainty … will note make our communities safer. He said that as they prioritize national security threats and public safety threats, ICE officers might have to even go into schools because \"many\" members of gangs tied to South and Central America, such as MS-13, are between 14 and 17 years old. In his interview with ABC News, Homan said that no other law enforcement agency is restricted from entering certain locations to promote public safety in the same way ICE has been. \"Name another agency, another law enforcement agency, that has those type of requirements, that they can't walk into a school or doctor's office or a medical campus,\" he said. \"No other agency is held to those standards.\" \"These are well-trained [ICE] officers with a lot of discretion, and when it comes to a sensitive location, there's still going to be supervisory review,\" he said. \"But ICE officers should have discretion to decide if a national security threat or a public safety threat [is] in one of these facilities.\" Homan said anyone already in the country unlawfully \"should leave,\" and those looking to claim asylum should \"do it the legal way.\" \"Go to the embassy, go to the point of entry,\" he said. \"You shouldn't come to this country and ask to get asylum and the first thing you do is break our laws by entering illegally.\" In the meantime, Homan said the Trump administration is using not just the military but the \"whole\" government, including the Justice Department, to support its mass deportation plan, which allows ICE officers to concentrate on conducting enforcement operations. But Homan acknowledged that the federal government won't be able to remove every undocumented immigrant in the U.S., and that his \"success is going to be based on what Congress gives us.\" ICE doesn't currently have enough funding from Congress to detain all of the undocumented immigrants that the Trump administration says it hopes to arrest. \"I'm being realistic,\" he said. \"We can do what we can with the money we have. We're going to try to be efficient. But with more money we have, the more we can accomplish.\" \"What price [do] you put on national security?\" he added. \"When you … don't secure that border, that's when national security threats enter the country. That's when sex trafficking goes up. That's when, you know, that's when the fentanyl comes in.\" As for what success practically looks like at the end of the Trump administration, Homan said: \"Our success every day is taking a public safety threat off the streets or getting a national security threat out of here.\" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "title": "2024 US home sales hit lowest level in nearly 30 years with ownership increasingly out of reach",
        "source": "https://apnews.com/",
        "content": "Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. A “For Sale” sign is displayed in front of a home in Morton Grove, Ill., Sunday, Aug. 25, 2024. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) LOS ANGELES (AP) — The latest evidence that homeownership is becoming increasingly less accessible to many Americans: Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last year to a nearly 30-year low for the second time in as many years. Elevated mortgage rates, a yearslong shortage of homes on the market andrecord-high home pricescontinued to stymie prospective home shoppers, especially first-time buyers. That led existing home sales to fall 0.7% last year to 4.06 million — the weakest showing for home sales since 1995 and edging out the terrible year for sales in 2023, the National Association of Realtors said Friday. Even in the midst of a sales slump, a dearth of homes on the market and rising mortgage rates gave sellers an edge over buyers, helping drive up the national median home price for all of last year to an all-time high $407,500, an increase of 4.7% from a year earlier. “How is it possible that home sales can be this low, considering that the U.S. population has increased by more than 70 million over this time period from 1995 to today?” asked Lawrence Yun, the NAR’s chief economist. “One can partly answer that question because of the affordability issue. Record-high home prices, mortgage rates having risen, but also lack of inventory.” The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump dating back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage surged to a 23-year high of nearly 8% in October 2023 and briefly fell to a 2-year low last September, but has beenmostly hovering around 7%,according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac.  The buying power of Americans now facing higher costs to borrow money for homes that have soared in value has been significantly stunted. With so few homes up for sale, millions of would-be homebuyers have found themselves on the sidelines. At the end of December, there were just 1.15 million homes on the market, NAR said. While that was up 16.2% from a year earlier, the inventory remained well below the annual historical average of about 1.98 million, according to data going back to 1999. The available inventory at the end of last month amounts to a 3.3-month supply, going by the current sales pace. In a more balanced market between buyers and sellers, there is a 4- to 6-month supply. “This means that the problems in the U.S. housing market continue to worsen in terms of availability of homes for sale and the upward pressure on home prices,” Eugenio Aleman, chief economist at Raymond James, wrote in a research note. Many factors have contributed to the housing shortage, including more than a decade of below-average new home construction and homeowners hanging on to their properties longer. And while President Donald Trump made increasing the housing supply one of his election campaign platforms, there are no quick fixes. “Over the past decade, the U.S. has averaged about 5.2 million home sales annually,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS. “It is going to take years before we are back at that level, maybe not even until the 2030s. The lack of inventory is the key constraint.” A sharp drop in the mortgage rate boosted the purchasing power of Americans in 2020 and 2021. While many economists predict that the average rate on a 30-year mortgage will ease this year, they generally don’t expect it to fall below 6%, about twice what it was five years ago. When mortgage rates ease, they can encourage home shoppers. A pullback in rates last fall helped home sales increase on a monthly basis in the last three months of the year. Home sales in December rose 2.2% from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis to a 4.24 million annual pace, NAR said. That topped the 4.2 million pace forecast by analysts polled by FactSet. Sales rose 9.3% in December versus the same month last year. The median home sales price rose for the 18th consecutive month in December to $404,000, up 6% from a year earlier. Limited inventory, especially in the more affordable price range of a given market, helps drive prices higher. That’s one reason many first-time homebuyers, who don’t have any home equity to put toward their down payment, continue to struggle. They accounted for 31% of all homes sold last month, up from 30% in November and 29% in December 2023. However, the annual share of first-time buyers was 24%. It’s been 40% historically.

Burroughs.  Country music comes naturally to Ringo Starr. The former Beatle has dabbled in the music ever since singing the country hit “Act Naturally” with the Beatles in 1965, and he’s now about to release a whole country album. Starr says in an interview with The Associated Press’ Andrew Dalton that he’s put a bit of country in most everything he’s done, so the album wasn’t too big a stretch. Starr says the project began when he bumped into his friend, classic country aficionado T-Bone Burnett, and asked him to write a song. Burnett came back with nine. The resulting album, “Look Up,” comes out in January.  Erykah Badu has been a music disruptor, culture shifter and style maven ever since she stepping into the limelight with her 1997 debut album, “Baduizm.” The four-time Grammy winner, who was recently honored with the CFDA (Council of Fashion Designers of America) Icon award, sat down with AP entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton to talk about her fashion influence, working on new music, her appearance in “The Piano Lesson” —and finally learning to stop and smell the flowers.

The reality competition series’ stars Johnny “Bananas” Devenanzio, Aneea Ferreira and Nurys Mateo — along with host TJ Lavin — sat down with AP entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton to talk about the 40th season, which features 40 returning competitors in a “Battle of the Eras.”  Michael Keaton says it would have been a “huge mistake” for his titular trickster ghost character to get significantly more screen time in “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” than he did in the first film. The 72-year-old star sat down with AP entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton to talk about why he was nervous to return for the sequel featuring Jenna Ortega and Winona Ryder, the impact of Tim Burton’s original 1988 horror comedy — and why he never thought of himself as playing Batman.  Justin Baldoni’s “It Ends With Us” journey began well before Colleen Hoover’s novel became a sensation on TikTok. The 40-year-old actor and filmmaker optioned the book in 2019 while he was shooting “Jane The Virgin” and preparing to release his feature film directorial debut, “Five Feet Apart.” Five years later, he spoke with AP entertainment journalist Alicia Rancilio about directing and co-starring alongside Blake Lively in the drama that revolves around domestic violence.

Josh Hartnett is looking back at shedding his Hollywood heartthrob image in the 2000s as he stars in M. Night Shyamalan’s thriller “Trap.” Hartnett is now 46 and lives in England with his wife and four children. While he’s been working steadily since breaking out in 1998 with a “Halloween” sequel and “The Faculty,” he intentionally moved away from studio movies and leading man roles after being typecast as his fame grew with movies like “Black Hawk Down” and “Pearl Harbor.” In “Trap,” Hartnett plays a father with a secret who takes his daughter to a pop concert — which is surrounded by police searching for a serial killer.  M. Night Shyamalan has been at least partly self-financing his films since 2015’s “The Visit,” risking his own money on box office success. His latest is “Trap,” starring Josh Hartnett as a father with a secret and Shyamalan’s daughter Saleka as a pop star whose concert is surrounded by police looking to capture a serial killer. Shyamalan spoke with AP entertainment editor Ryan Pearson about his high-risk, high-reward, lower-budget filmmaking approach, guiding his daughters’ artistic pursuits — and his philosophy that “talent is process.”  Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Bridgestone said the closure will help the company “optimize its business footprint” and “strengthen its competitiveness.” In addition, Bridgestone announced capacity and workforce reductions at its Des Moines, Iowa, agriculture tire plant and additional workforce reductions in U.S. corporate, sales and operations. In Latin America, it plans reductions in workforce and production capacity in Argentina and Brazil. “Reductions in force are impacting our corporate, sales and operations in the Americas where a realignment of staffing levels is needed in response to the challenging economic environment,” company spokesperson Emily Weaver said in an email. “Of our nearly 44,000 teammates across North America and Latin America, just under 4% of our teammates are leaving the company as part of the voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions.” The LaVergne plant was the first tire-producing facility in North America for the Bridgestone Corporation. The company stopped making tires for cars and light trucks at the plant in 2009, laying off roughly half of the workers at the time. LaVergne's United Steelworkers master union workers have preferential hiring rights at the company's plants in Des Moines; Akron, Ohio; and Russellville, Arkansas, Weaver said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)                 PARK CITY, Utah (AP) —Rose Byrneplays a mother in the midst of a breakdown in the experiential psychological thriller “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You.” Anticipation was high for the A24 film, which will be released sometime this year. Its premiere Friday at theSundance Film Festivalwas easily the hottest ticket in town, with even ticketholders unable to get in. Those who did make it into the Library theater were treated to an intense, visceral, inventive story from filmmaker Mary Bronstein that has quickly become one of the festival’s must-sees. Byrne plays Linda, who is barely hanging on while managing her daughter’s mysterious illness. She’s faced with crisis after crisis, big and small — from the massive, gaping hole in their apartment ceiling that forces them to move to a dingy motel, to an escalating showdown with a parking attendant at a care center. The cracks in her psychological, emotional and physical wellbeing are become too much to bear. “I’d never seen a movie before where a mother is going through a crisis with a child but our energy is not with the child’s struggle, it’s with the mother’s,” Bronstein said at the premiere. “If you’re a caretaker, you shouldn’t be bothering with yourself at all. It should all be about the person you’re taking care of, right? And that is a particular kind of emotional burnout state that I was really interested in exploring.” Byrne and Bronstein went deep in the preparation phase, having long discussions about Linda with the goal of making her as real as possible before the quick, 27-day shoot. Byrne said she was obsessed with figuring out who Linda was before the crisis. The film was in part inspired by Bronstein’s experience with her own daughter, but she didn’t want to elaborate on the specifics.  “That’s her story to tell,” Bronstein said. Part of Linda’s story involves her therapist, played byConan O’Brien, who joked that he didn’t realize he was in a movie. “I’m not looking out for movie scripts or anything. But when I got a call from A24 that they wanted me to read something, I’m not stupid,” O’Brien said. “I showed it to my wife, who is one of the smartest people I know, and she read through it and she said, ‘I didn’t know they made movies like this anymore.’” He was particularly in awe of his director and co-star, saying he felt like a fraud standing beside them. “It was an amazing experience, one of the best experiences of my life, just to be with them and watch them work,” O’Brien said. “I don’t know how (Byrne) did that and not check into a hospital afterwards, because I haven’t seen any actor, man or woman, sustain that level for an entire movie.” “I feel like I have to go to a hospital now, because this was the first time I watched it,” he added. “I’m a mess.” A$AP Rockyalso co-stars, as a man Linda meets at the motel, but was not in Park City for the premiere. He is currentlyon trial, charged with firing a gun at a former friend. The film is full of ambiguity, metaphor and just plain artistic expression that Bronstein hesitated to explain, from the name itself to the hole in the ceiling, which takes on a somewhat supernatural quality. “When we have nothing left to give, we have an emptiness inside of us,” Bronstein said. “And that emptiness is actually not empty: It’s filled with all the darkness and self-hate and doubt and fear and dread and regret and everything. … That to me is what the hole is.” Some of it, she said, she doesn’t even fully understand. The point is the experience, and critics and Sundance audiences are already fully on board. Bronstein, a bit of a cult figure in the film world, made her directorial debut in 2008 at the SXSW festival with “Yeast,” which featured a pre-fame Greta Gerwig and was hailed by by New Yorker critic Richard Brody as a “mumblecore classic.” “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” is only her second feature. “This is the first time that anybody else has paid for me to make art,” Bronstein said. “I’m proud to say that this is the film that came directly from my head to the screen.” For more coverage of the 2025 Sundance Film Festival, visit:https://apnews.com/hub/sundance-film-festival   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Marta Lavandier)           Dearica Hamby still smiles at the memory of Kobe Bryant sitting courtside at WNBA games. She had met him years ago. He came to see her old team, the Las Vegas Aces, play all the time. “I think one of the first things he told me was that I could play defense,” Hamby recalled. “And I was kind of like ‘Wha-at?’ ... That’s something I’ll cherish with me forever.” That epitomized the late NBA great’s relationship with the women’s game. After his 20-year playing career ended, Bryant turned his focus to the next generation, mentoring some of women’s basketball’s biggest stars, from WNBA champion and Olympic gold medalist Diana Taurasi to former Oregon star Sabrina Ionescu. He worked out with them, analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of their game and pushed for them to reach the same heights in popularity that he and his NBA peers did. For Hamby, now with the Los Angeles Sparks, Bryant saw an aspect of her game she didn’t even know she had. “If Kobe tells you you can play defense, you can play defense,” she quipped. Five years after Bryant, 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven otherswere killed in a helicopter crashin Calabasas, California, several women’s basketball players reflected on what he meant to their game and how he championed it. Many of them thought Bryant would be pleased with the overall progress of women’s sports, which haveskyrocketed in popularity and reachin recent years. That growth has been most prominent in the women’s basketball arenas that Bryant and Gianna loved so much.  The WNBA last season had its most-watched regular season in 24 years and its best attendance in 22 seasons. Some of the league’s most popular players currently are competing in a new3-on-3 leaguein South Florida called Unrivaled, founded by Olympic gold medalists Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart. “We carry this on for him,” said Satou Sabally, a forward with the WNBA’s Dallas Wings who plays for the Phantom squad in Unrivaled. “He would be so proud of this league. He would be proud of ’Phe and Stewie. I know that he’s looking down and hopefully he’s smiling and is proud of us.” Sabally said she still gets emotional when she thinks of that day on Jan. 26, 2020. It reminds her of her playing days at Oregon, when she, Ionescu and their Ducks teammates connected over Bryant. “I think about ... how we all bonded together over Kobe and how we bonded together for the rest of our lives because he was so impactful,” Sabally added. “He was really a person that saw us women as the talents who we are. He came to the games, he was so outspoken and he really was really supportive.” The shock of the superstar’s death echoed throughout the sports and entertainment worlds, with many taking to social media to post emotional tributes to Bryant while expressing their disbelief. People were glued to their phones and TV screens as news of the crash spread. NBA players were in tears ahead of games that day. “I still remember exactly where I was whenever we heard the news,” said Kate Martin of the Golden State Valkyries, playing for Laces BC at Unrivaled, “and no one really knew if it was fake or real. I think that’s just one of those things where you’re just always going to remember exactly where you were when you heard that.” Martin never met Bryant but said she cherishes his mentality — he had a relentless competitiveness — and the way he elevated women’s sports. Bryant became heavily involved with his daughters’ hoops journeys and coached Gianna’s youth team. He was often at women’s basketball games, especially college ones, with Gianna, who was fascinated with the UConn Huskies. Gianna was in line to further Bryant’s legacy on the court. The plan was for her to attend Connecticut, and surely the WNBA was next. Bryant was passionate about women’s sports despite the belief of some that he should not have been involved with the women’s game at all because of a 2003 charge accusing him of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old employee at a Colorado resort. Bryant had said the two had consensual sex, and the charge was eventually dropped when the woman declined to testify at trial. The woman later filed a civil suit against Bryant that was settled out of court. There’s an image that still circulates in the sports world today: Kobe and Gianna sitting courtside at a 2019 game featuring his Los Angeles Lakers. He wore a bright orange pullover with a white WNBA logo on the front. Gianna sat beaming at his side. “I think a lot of people started to follow behind Kobe because he recognized our gift and our talent and how special it really is,” said former Chicago Sky head coach Teresa Weatherspoon, the current coach of Unrivaled’s Vinyl BC. “And his daughter was right there as well.” That’s who Bryant had become — a face of women’s sports advocacy. “He’s greatly missed,” Martin said. “But now his legacy will live on forever.” AP WNBA:https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Atkins had allegedly posted \"violent rhetoric\" about Trump on his Facebook account, West Palm Beach Police Department Chief Tony Araujo said during a press conference on Saturday.

Police said they became aware of the posts after another man, from Okeechobee, Florida, sent in a tip to the FBI. Atkins was taken into custody without incident Friday night. He was found with cocaine on him, according to police. It was not immediately clear if Atkins has retained an attorney. ABC News has reached out to him for comment. Araujo said the U.S. Secret Service was notified of the arrest and is looking into it to determine if federal charges should be filed. \"In today's climate, you really can't say things like this,\" Araujo said. \"We have incident after incident, example after example, of when these threats become real, and we take these very seriously.\" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "content": "Since June 1, 2024, Los Angeles has only picked up 0.03 inches of rainfall. Rain was falling across Southern California on Sunday, bringing some relief to thousands of firefighters battling multiplemajor blazesfor nearly a month in the Los Angeles area, but also prompting new threats of floods and mudslides across burn-scarred lands. A flood watch issued by the National Weather Service is to go into effect at 10 a.m. local time on Sunday for fire-ravaged areas of Los Angeles County, which has been ground zero for the historic firestorms that have leveled thousands of homes and killed at least 28 people since first igniting on Jan. 7. The flood watch will remain in effect until Monday afternoon in burn-scarred areas left by the Eaton, Palisades, Franklin, Bridge and Hughes fires. The rain is forecast to be widespread but is expected to be light enough to avoid major flooding. But if a downpour spends enough time over one of the recent burn scars, a debris flow could become an issue. Rain totals from the storm will mostly range from a half-inch to an inch, allowing for a decent soaking for the first time in months. Since June 1, Los Angeles has only picked up 0.03 inches of rainfall, which has allowed an extreme drought to develop across the area for the first time in two years. In addition to rain, higher elevations of Southern California, including the San Gabriel Mountains straddling northern Los Angeles and western San Bernardino counties, are expecting snow, with areas above 4,000 feet getting up to 14 inches of powder. The rain and snow forecast comes as firefighters continued to battle five active fires on Sunday from Ventura County north of Los Angeles to the Mexican border south of San Diego. The Palisades Fire, which ignited on Jan. 7 in Los Angeles County's Pacific Palisades, was 84% contained as of Sunday after burning more than 23,000 acres, destroying nearly 7,000 structures and killing 11 people, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). The Eaton Fire, which also broke out on Jan. 7 in Pasadena and Altadena, was 95% contained on Sunday after burning more than 14,000 acres, destroying more than 9,400 structures and killing 17 people. Other fires still active on Sunday, according to Cal Fire, include the Hughes Fire near Castaic Lake, about 45 miles north of downtown Los Angeles, which was 90% contained after starting on Wednesday and burning more than 10,000 acres of brush land; the Border 2 Fire that broke out Thursday near the San Diego-Mexico border and is 10% contained after burning more than 6,600 acres of wilderness land; and the Laguna Fire, which also started Thursday in Camarillo in Ventura County, which was 98% contained on Sunday after charring 83 acres and prompting a brief evacuation of the California State University Channel Islands. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi)       Ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon appeared at risk on Sunday as disputes continued over key deadlines, and local health officials said that Israeli forces opened fire on both fronts. In Gaza,Israel accused Hamasof violating the ceasefire there by changing the order of hostages it has released. Citing that, Israel has stopped thousands of Palestinians from returning to the northern part ofthe Gaza Stripas expected by Sunday. Local health officials said that Israeli forces fired on the crowd, killing two. Israel said civilian hostage Arbel Yehoud should have been releasedbefore the four soldiers freed on Saturday. Mediators the United States, Qatar and Egypt were working on the issue. In Lebanon, health officials said thatIsraeli forces opened fireon protesters in the south who demanded that Israel withdraw in line with the ceasefire agreement, killing at least 22. Separately, officials with Hamas and Jordan rejected U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion that most of Gaza’s populationshould be at least temporarily resettled elsewhere, including in Egypt and Jordan. The war in Gaza broke out after Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people in southern Israel in an attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and abducted around 250. Israel’s retaliatory military operation has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of thevictims childrenand women, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians. Here is the latest: RAMALLAH, West Bank — The office of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has sharply condemned U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion to “clean out” the Gaza Strip and request that Egypt and Jordan take in more Palestinians. In a statement, the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited control over parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, says the prospect of mass displacement from the Gaza Strip “constitutes a violation of the red lines that we have repeatedly warned against.” “Our people will not leave,” the statement said. “We warn of the repercussions of such a dangerous Israeli policy that contributes to severing the ties of the Gaza Strip, and displacing its people, which will lead to destabilization and security.” Trump’s remarks suggesting that Palestinians be encouraged to leave Gaza gets at the core of Palestinian fears that they will be driven from their remaining homeland. The Palestinian presidency said it was “ready to assume its full duties in the Gaza Strip” in hopes of eventually establishing an independent Palestinian state. The Palestinian Authority, based in the West Bank city of Ramallah, briefly controlled Gaza after Israeli troops withdrew in 2005, only to be driven out by its rival Hamas two years later. PARIS — France will consider allowing Israeli companies to participate in the Paris Air Show in June, thanks to ceasefire agreements in Gaza and Lebanon, the French president’s office said Sunday. That was among the results of a conversation Sunday between French President Emmanuel Macron and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Macron said France hopes to help speed up the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza, two of whom are French citizens. Macron also urged Israel to allow for a ″massive″ facilitation of aid to Gaza’s population, and to fulfill its promises to withdraw troops from Lebanon under a truce brokered by the U.S. and France. Netanyahu asked about Israeli participation in the upcoming Paris Air Show at Le Bourget, a major industry event. The French president said Israeli participation ″could be favorably considered, as a consequence of the cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon,″ according to Macron’s office. Tensions surrounded Israel’s participation in twoarms shows in Francelast year, Eurosatory and Euronaval. The French government did not want Israel displaying any weapons used in its wars in Gaza and Lebanon. RAMALLAH, West Bank — A spokesman for the Islamic Jihad, Gaza’s second-largest militant group, says the dispute over an Israeli hostage that has kept Palestinians from returning home to northern Gaza has been settled. Mohamed al-Hajj Mousa added in a statement that the group told mediators that the hostage, Arbel Yehoud, will be released before Saturday, when the next exchange of hostages from Gaza for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody is set to take place. There is no immediate comment from Israel, which has accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire by changing the order of hostages it has released. It expected Yehoud to be freed this weekend, and it has put the movement of Palestinians into northern Gaza on hold. RAMALLAH, West Bank — The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees says that if Israel carries out its threat to close its east Jerusalem headquarters on Thursday, the outsize effects will be felt acutely and immediately by tens of thousands of Palestinians. The agency, known as UNRWA, runs 12 facilities that provide critical public services across east Jerusalem, including schools enrolling at least 1,200 children and free clinics serving over 70,000 people. “That’s the thing, it has an impact on people’s lives,” Juliette Touma, a spokeswoman for UNRWA, said of the potential closure. In the Shuafat refugee camp, an impoverished neighborhood, “people today can walk just a few meters and they’re in an excellent clinic,” Touma said. But if it’s shuttered, she said, tens of thousands of Palestinians would have to cross a difficult checkpoint, pay for transport and, even if they’re eligible for Israeli primary health care, also pay for medicine in order to see a doctor or get a blood test. “We’re talking about the poorest of the poor,” Touma said. “Right now, they have no alternative.” The closure of UNRWA schools would raise all sorts of problems given that there are already too few classrooms in the overcrowded Palestinian areas of east Jerusalem, she said. Touma said much remains unclear about the Israeli order, including whether the closure would apply to operations in east Jerusalem only or to the entirety of the Palestinian territories. Israel says the agency has allowed itself to be infiltrated by Hamas, allegations denied by the U.N. TEL AVIV, Israel — Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and former National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, both want Israel to establish Jewish settlements in Gaza, supported Trump’s remarks, calling it “voluntary emigration.” Palestinians and many of their supporters view it as code for ethnic cleansing. In a post on X Sunday, Smotrich called the idea of “helping (Palestinians) find other places to start new, good lives” great and said he would work with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to that end. Ben-Gvir, who quit Netanyahu’s government over the current ceasefire in Gaza, said Trump’s remarks gave Israel the green light to move ahead on “voluntary emigration.” “When the president of the world’s largest superpower brings it up himself, the government of Israel should implement it,” he said in a statement. Netanyahu has said building Jewish settlements in Gaza is not realistic. Israel withdrew troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but maintains a blockade with Egypt on the territory. JERUSALEM — The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees says its staff was directed to vacate the premises by Thursday. Israelpassed legislation last yearcutting all ties with the agency and barring it from operating in its territory. It says the agency, which is the main provider of aid in the Gaza Strip, has allowed itself to be infiltrated by Hamas, allegations denied by the U.N. In a statement Sunday, the agency, known as UNRWA, said the order to vacate “is in contradiction to international law obligations of U.N. member states,” including Israel. “United Nations premises are inviolable and enjoy privileges and immunities under the United Nations Charter.” UNRWA closed its east Jerusalem headquarters last May after Israeli protesters set fire to its perimeter. DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Bassem Naim said that “even if seemingly well-intentioned under the guise of reconstruction,” the Palestinian people will never agree to such a proposal. He also said the Palestinians can rebuild Gaza “even better than before”if Israel lifts its blockade. DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli forces fired on the crowds on three occasions overnight and into Sunday. Those killed included a child, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel has pulled back from several areas of Gaza as part of the ceasefire, which came into force last Sunday, but the military has warned people to stay away from its forces, which are still operating in a buffer zone inside Gaza along the border and in the Netzarim corridor.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)         WASHINGTON (AP) — Two months ago, in his first network television interview after the election,Donald Trumpsaid he owed his victory to Americans’ anger over immigration and inflation, specifically the rising cost of groceries. “When you buy apples, when you buy bacon, when you buy eggs, they would double and triple the price over a short period of time,” he told NBC’s “Meet the Press. “And I won an election based on that. We’re going to bring those prices way down.” But in Trump’s first week back in the White House, there was little in his initial blitz ofexecutive ordersthat directly tackled those prices, besides directing federal agencies to start“pursuing appropriate actions.”He is taking steps to lower energy costs, something that Trump hopes will have ripple effects throughout the economy. Otherwise, his focus has been clamping down on immigration, which he described as his “No. 1 issue” shortly after taking the oath of office. “They all said inflation was the No. 1 issue. I said, ‘I disagree,’” Trump said. “I talked about inflation too, but how many times can you say that an apple has doubled in cost?” Trump is banking on voters giving him a pass andcontinuing to blame former President Joe Bidenfor high prices. The Republican’s comments reflect the reality that presidents have almost no levers to reduce inflation quickly without causing collateral damage to other parts of the economy.  There is more that Trump can do on energy. He is pushing to reduce regulations andincrease the amount of landavailable for drilling. He is trying to persuade domestic and foreign oil producers to potentially sacrifice their own profitsby pumping more. During a rally Saturday in Las Vegas, Trump went after his Democratic predecessor for allowing prices to rise under his watch, and promised to take care of the problem quickly. “When I think of Biden, I think of incompetence and inflation,” Trump said. Inflation peaked at a 9.1% annual rate in June 2022 during worldwide supply chain problems after the economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. Overall consumer prices have fallen since then, but have ticked up in recent months, from 2.4% in September to 2.9% in December, the latest figures available. Economists have warned that Trump’s plans for tariffs and tax cuts could create new inflationary pressures and keep interest rates elevated. Vice President JD Vance, in an interview with CBS’ “Face the Nation” airing Sunday, defended the White House’s work so far. “Prices are going to come down, but it’s going to take a little bit of time, right?” he said. He added, “Rome wasn’t built in a day.” Trump’s relative shift away from addressing costs could create an opening for Democrats to say he is not helping working-class voters, hoping that argument could offer the party a path back to power in Washington. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said Trump preferred to distract people from inflation with talk of adding Greenland to the United States or seizing the Panama Canal. “It’s catnip and it causes everybody to stop paying attention to their actual economic agenda, which has nothing to do with lowering costs and everything to do with rigging the economy to help the Mar-a-Lago crowd,” he said. During an interview on Fox News this past week, host Sean Hannity struggled to get Trump to focus on the economy. “Let me get to the economy,” Hannity said at one point. “I’m running out of time.” “The economy is going to do great,” Trump insisted. When Trump did talk about inflation in the interview, he noted how low it was during his first term and insisted prices would not have jumped up if he had president after the 2020 election, even though higher inflation was a global trend coming out of the pandemic. It is not clear how Trump would persuade oil companies and foreign countries to quickly increase production, possibly costing them profits. The Energy Information Administration reported that domestic oil production has grown at an annual rate of roughly 8.4% over the past two years to an average of nearly 13.5 million barrels a day in October. Some Trump aides suggest that could increase by an additional 3 million barrels a day. It would be difficult to achieve that much additional production in a single year without serious changes to the global market. The International Energy Agency estimates that the oil supplied to the entire world will increase by 1.8 million barrels per day to 104.7 million barrels a day. He also has expressed opposition to climate-friendlier wind and solar energy, putting more pressure on the U.S. economy to rely on fossil fuels. EJ Antoni, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, said the potential increase in energy production under Trump would ultimately flow through the economy in the form of lower prices. “If you’re going to bring down the cost of energy, you’re going to bring down the cost of all kinds of goods and services,” he said. But there is a risk that some of Trump’s plans taken as a whole could raise — not reduce — prices. Deporting migrants who are in the United States illegally could deprive companies of lower wage workers. The cost of tariffs, which are taxes placed on foreign imports, could be passed on to consumers. Trump said that his strategy also might ultimately involvepublicly pressuring the Federal Reserveto cut interest rates, saying in Davos that he would “demand” lower rates from central banks. The Fed sees its political independence as key for making tough choices to stabilize prices. Biden saw the independence as worth protecting, whereas Trump sees it as problematic. The Fed raised its benchmark rates starting in 2022 to make it more expensive to borrow and succeeded enough in reducing inflationary pressures that it could trim rates late last year. Trump believes that greater oil production will put him in a position to tell the Fed what to do. Asked in the Oval Office if he expects the Fed to listen to him, Trump simply said, “Yeah.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

The government is consulting on whether to let tech firms use copyrighted material to help train artificial intelligence models unless the creators explicitly opt out. McCartney told the BBC that would make it harder for artists to retain control of their work and undermine Britain’s creative industries. “You get young guys, girls, coming up, and they write a beautiful song, and they don’t own it, and they don’t have anything to do with it. And anyone who wants can just rip it off,” the 82-year-oldformer Beatlesaid in an interview to be broadcast Sunday. An extract was released Saturday by the BBC. “The truth is, the money’s going somewhere. When it gets on the streaming platforms, somebody is getting it, and it should be the person who created it. It shouldn’t be some tech giant somewhere.” Britain’s center-leftLabour Party governmentsays it wants to make the U.K. a world leader in AI. In December, it announced a consultation into how copyright law can “enable creators and right holders to exercise control over, and seek remuneration for, the use of their works for AI training” while also ensuring “AI developers have easy access to a broad range of high-quality creative content.” Publishers, artists’ organizations and media companies, including The Associated Press, have banded together as the Creative Rights in AI Coalition to oppose weakening copyright protections. “We’re the people, you’re the government. You’re supposed to protect us. That’s your job,” McCartney said. “So you know, if you’re putting through a bill, make sure you protect the creative thinkers, the creative artists, or you’re not going to have them.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "content": "The FBI said a 21-year-old woman was arrested for fatally shooting the agent. An arrest has been made in thefatal shooting of a U.S. Border Patrol agentduring a traffic stop in Vermont, according to the FBI, as bizarre details of the suspects' movements beforehand have been revealed in the arrest affidavit. Teresa Youngblut, 21, of Washington state, was arrested on Friday and charged with assault on a federal law enforcement officer, according to a statement from the FBI. The affidavit unsealed by investigators reveals some new details about the movements of the two individuals who were involved in the fatal shooting of Border Patrol agent David Maland. Since Jan. 14, investigators had been conducting \"periodic surveillance\" on Youngblut and Felix Baukholt, a German national who was killed during the shooting, after they were reported as suspicious by someone who was staying at the same hotel as the pair, according to court records. \"An employee of a hotel in Lyndonville, Vermont contacted law enforcement after a male and a female had checked into the hotel to report concerns about them, including that they appeared to be dressed in all-black tactical style clothing with protective equipment, with the woman, later identified as Youngblut, carrying an apparent firearm in an exposed-carry holster,\" according to charges unsealed in Vermont federal court on Friday. Agents from the Vermont State Police and Homeland Security Investigations attempted to approach the pair for a voluntary interview, but they rebuffed law enforcement, \"claiming that they were in the vicinity to look at purchasing property,\" according to the court records. Five days later, the pair were spotted in downtown Newport, Vermont, in \"similar tactical dress\" and carrying a handgun, which is permitted in Vermont, the affidavit said. On Monday, the day of the fatal shooting, the two were being observed by law enforcement in the parking lot of a Walmart nearby, prosecutors said. Investigators observed Baukholt come out of the store with rolls of aluminum foil that he then used to wrap cellphones, they said. The stop was initiated by Border Patrol agents under the pretext of an immigration violation, according to the court records. Between 3 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. agents reported gunshots from the scene, according to the affidavit. Agents described to their supervisor \"that both Baukholt and Youngblut possessed firearms and that Youngblut drew and fired a handgun toward at least one of the uniformed Border Patrol agents without warning when outside the driver's side of the Prius. Baukholt then attempted to draw a firearm. At least one Border Patrol agent fired at Youngblut and Baukholt with his service weapon,\" according to the affidavit. Upon searching the vehicle, agents found a cache of weapons and tactical gear, as well as the cellphones wrapped in foil. The agents have not been interviewed according to the complaint, officials said. \"Agent Maland bravely served his country as a member of the U.S. Air Force,\" said Special Agent in Charge Craig Tremaroli of the FBI Albany Field Office in a statement. \"He continued that service when he answered the call to protect and serve as a law enforcement officer, making him a shining example of service over self. This arrest proves the FBI, together with our partners, will work diligently to ensure any individual who uses a firearm to assault such a public servant will be brought to justice.\" ABC News' Alex Faul contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)                              FRESNO, Texas (AP) — The only moment TiAnna Yeldell has to herself is when she’s sleeping, and that doesn’t happen much. The 44-year-old single mom of three works 80-hour weeks to provide for her children, ages 8, 14, and 18. During the day, she is a driver for Pizza Hut, where she earns $9.50 an hour before tips. At night, she cleans trains for Houston’s Metro system, where she earns about $17 an hour. The times that she pulls both shifts, Yeldell sleeps for just two to three hours before getting her kids up and ready for school. Then she does it all over again. Yeldell is among the millions of fast food workers across the U.S. scraping to get by. Abouttwo-thirdsof them are women, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and many are supporting their families on minimum wages set at the federal government’s floor of $7.25 an hour. Fast food workers are disproportionately Hispanic, making up 24.6% of the industry’s workforce compared with 18.8% of the overall workforce. And more than half of all U.S. fast food workers are 20 or older, “contrary to the myth of it being a teenage job that they just do for pocket money,” said Tsedeye Gebreselassie, an attorney for nonprofit advocacy organization National Employment Law Project. TiAnna Yeldell, a 44-year-old single mom of three, prepares to make a delivery for Pizza Hut, Thursday, Nov. 14, 2024, in Missouri City, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)  President Donald Trump, whomanned the fry station at a McDonald’sin Pennsylvania while on the campaign trail last year, has acknowledged that the federal minimum wage is “very low” and that he would consider raising it, but that doing so would be “complicated.” Meanwhile, a growing number of states have pushed to increase their minimum wage in the face of record-high inflation in recent years. Voters in Alaska approved a ballot initiative in November that will raise the state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour from $11.73 an hour by 2027. Missouri voters likewise approved a minimum wage hike to $15 from $12.30 an hour by 2026. And California — which has one of the highest costs of living in the country — in Aprilraised wagesfor fast food workers specifically, to $20 an hour from $16 an hour.  By the end of this year, 23 states and 65 cities and counties will raise their minimum wage floors, according to a December 2024 National Employment Law Projectreportthat combed through legislation across the country.  But not Texas, where Yeldell and her family live. It isone of 20 statesat the $7.25 federal minimum wage floor and that rate hasn’t budged since 2009. Democratic lawmakers in Texas have repeatedly proposed legislation to raise the minimum wage in the state to no avail.Preemption laws, which exist in Texas and many other states, block cities and counties from adopting their own minimum wage laws, presenting another barrier. Today, a living wage for one adult raising three children in the Houston metro area is $57.65 an hour, according to MIT’s Living Wage Calculator. For Yeldell, it’s not possible to get by on her fast food job alone, which is why she must work a second job. Still wearing her visor and gray “No One Out Pizzas The Hut” shirt, she slumps sideways after a recent work shift, resting an elbow on the folding table surrounded by four folding chairs where the family eats. The living room furniture is sparse but the home is tidy. A yellow mop bucket sits near the entryway, and a small vacuum rests against the closet door. She only takes a moment to rest before changing into Looney Tunes sweatpants and a yellow T-shirt, scooping fajitas onto plates for the kids’ dinner, and packing up the leftovers. Then the teens disappear into their bedrooms, and her Minecraft pajama-clad youngest curls up next to her on the couch, playing a game on a bright red console. TiAnna Yeldell, left, spends time with her son Ivan, 8, right, at her home, Thursday, Nov. 14, 2024, in Missouri City, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)  “I don’t want to work two jobs -- I’m really tired. But I have to, because the jobs don’t pay enough,” Yeldell said. “I would not be able to provide a roof over my kids’ head … They come first, I come second.” The Associated Press reached out to Pizza Hut, as well as its parent company, Yum Brands, for comment on wages for fast food workers but did not hear back. Wages are just one of many issues fast food workers face. Unpredictable hours, limited access to paid sick leave, and challenging customer interactions all shape their experiences, said Daniel Schneider, co-director and co-founder of the Shift Project, a joint Harvard and University of California, San Francisco project researching the conditions of service sector work. Wage theft and other law violations are also common in the industry, added labor scholar David Madland, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. “The fast food industry is notorious for low pay and poor working conditions,” Madland said. “It’s seen as the almost the sort of typical throwaway job that policy has cared very little about.” Yeldell’s Pizza Hut deliveries sometimes go until 11 p.m. She carries a knife in her pocket, as well as a flashlight, to keep her safe.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)  TiAnna Yeldell works in the kitchen at Pizza Hut, Thursday, Nov. 14, 2024, in Missouri City, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)  Despite the challenges, Yeldell maintains a positive outlook about her job, which she started about a year and a half ago as a delivery driver and has since learned to do “pretty much everything” at her Fresno, Texas store, including making pizzas, prepping ingredients, and running the register. “Pizza Hut is a really easy job and the job is only hard if you make it hard,” she said. “And I’m a fast learner, so it doesn’t bother me. The only time that it’s worrisome is when we’re slow and they say, ‘Oh, we got to cut your hours.’” Contrast Texas to California, which now has the highest fast food minimum wage of any state since lawmakers passed a minimum $20 hourly wage for those workers. Angelica Hernandez, 51, who has worked at various McDonald’s restaurants for 20 years and now works for a Monterey Park location in Los Angeles County, said the raise helped her pay rent and bills on time, avoid late fees, and buy “a bit more” at the grocery store. It’s also allowed her family the chance to go out to eat on the weekends, “which I was never able to do before, so it’s a big accomplishment what fast food workers were able to win,” she said. But Hernandez says much of the increase was swallowed by a recent $200 rent hike. “We need a little more to be able to save money and buy clothes without being tight every two weeks or have to use credit,” she said. Now, Hernandez is a member of California Fast Food Workers Union, and councilmember on the state’s Fast Food Council established bythe new California lawand aimed at improving working conditions.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)  Critics ofthe lawsay continuing to increase minimum wage is not the answer, arguing that it has raised prices and reduced job opportunities for young people, pinching franchisees in an industry with already-slim margins. “When you see a spike in operating costs pretty dramatically in a short period of time, it creates challenges,” said Jot Condie, president and CEO of the California Restaurant Association, which opposed the law. He added that franchisees, who are essentially small business owners, are most harmed. But a September report from University of California, Berkeley’s Institute for Research on Labor and Employment called the effects of the new law “benign,” and found that the policy did not affect employment adversely and increased prices about 3.7%, or about 15 cents on a $4 hamburger. For Yeldell, increasing the minimum wage in Texas “would be more fair.” ”If other states could change, y’all can change too,” she said. Her exhaustion shines through: her movements are slow, and her eyelids droop. Between her two jobs, she has no days off so her activities with the kids have to happen on the days she works at one job, not both. But she makes it happen. On a chilly Friday morning at 7 a.m., she walks her youngest to the bus stop, then drives her daughter across town to have her senior pictures done before her Pizza Hut shift starts.

Both women’s hair is arranged in long, elegant braids with the ends curled. “Being a mother, I do what I’m supposed to do for my kids,” she said. But for all her hard work, Yeldell says the family has little to no savings. On good months, she says she has about $100 left over. Often, she has nothing, which leaves no room for vacations, or outings with kids. “At the end of the day, I’ve worked all these hours and I really have nothing to show for it, but just paying some bills,” she said.

(Neon via AP)         NEW YORK (AP) — Critics lambasted it and audiences didn’t grade it much better. But despite the turbulence,Mel Gibson’s “Flight Risk”managed to open No. 1 at the box office with a modest $12 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. On a quiet weekend, even for the typically frigid movie-going month of January, the top spot went to the Lionsgate thriller starring Mark Wahlberg as a pilot flying an Air Marshal (Michelle Dockery) and fugitive (Topher Grace) across Alaska. But it wasn’t a particularly triumphant result for Gibson’s directorial follow-up to 2016’s“Hacksaw Ridge.”Reviews (21% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores (a “C” CinemaScore) were terrible. President Donald Trumprecentlynamed Gibson a “special ambassador”to Hollywood, along with Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone. Going into the weekend, Hollywood’s attention was more focused on theSundance Film Festivaland on Thursday’sOscar nominations, which were twice postponed by thewildfires in the Los Angeles region. The weekend was also a small test as to whether the once more common Oscar “bump” that can sometimes follow nominations still exists. Most contenders have by now completed the bulk of their theatrical runs and are more likely to see an uptick on VOD or streaming. But the weekend’s most daring gambit was A24 pushingBrady Corbet’s “The Brutalist”a three–and-a-half-hour epic nominated for 10 Academy Awards, into wide release. Though some executives initially greeted “The Brutalist,” which is running with an intermission, as “un-distributable,” Corbet has said, A24 acquired the film out of the Venice Film Festival and it’s managed solid business, collecting $6 million in limited release.  In wide release, it earned $2.9 million — a far from blockbuster sum but the best weekend yet for “The Brutalist.” The audience was downright miniscule for another best-picture nominee: RaMell Ross’“Nickel Boys.”Innovatively shot almost entirely in first-person POV, the Amazon MGM Studios release gathered just $340,171 in 540 locations after expanding by 300 theaters. Coming offone of the lowest Martin Luther King Jr. weekends in years, no new releases made a major impact. Steven Soderbergh’s “Presence,”a well-reviewed horror film shot from the perspective of a ghost inside a suburban home, debuted with $3.4 million in 1,750 locations. The film, released by Neon and acquired out of last year’s Sundance, was made for just $2 million. The top spots otherwise went to holdovers. The Walt Disney Co.’s“Mufasa: The Lion King,”in its sixth weekend of release, scored $8.7 million to hold second place. After starting slow, the Barry Jenkins-directed film has amassed $626.7 million globally. “One of Them Days,”the Keke Palmer and SZA led comedy from Sony Pictures, held well in its second weekend, dropping just 32% with $8 million in ticket sales. In recent years, few comedies have found success on the big screen, but “One of Them Days” has proven an exception. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. “Flight Risk,” $12 million. 2. “Mufasa: The Lion King,” $8.7 million. 3. “One of Them Days,” $8 million. 4. “Sonic the Hedgehog 3,” $5.5 million. 5. “Moana 2,” $4.3 million. 6. “Presence,” $3.4 million. 7. “Wolf Man,” $3.4 million. 8. “A Complete Unknown,” $3.1 million. 9. “Den of Thieves 2: Pantera,” $3 million. 10. “The Brutalist,” $2.9 million.

In an interview with ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz, Homan said that only days after Trump took office, the U.S. government for the first time ever used military aircraft to transport migrants back to their home country, and it will now be a daily occurrence. According to U.S. officials, the U.S. military on Thursday flew more than 150 migrants to Guatemala on two separate flights. But Homan made clear that the military flights are just one part of a much broader plan. He claimed that – unlike under the Biden administration –Immigrationand Customs Enforcement officers are now free to arrest any of the estimated more than 11 million immigrants in the country without legal status, not just those identified as priorities for deportation for being convicted criminals or other public safety threats. Watch more of Martha Raddatz' interview with Tom Homan Sunday on ABC's 'This Week' \"If you're in the country illegally, you're on the table because it's not okay to, you know, violate the laws of this country,\" he said. Homan said that while the Trump administration's enforcement actions are currently prioritizing public safety and national security threats, they're going to \"open up the aperture\" in the weeks and months ahead. \"As that aperture opens, there'll be more arrests nationwide,\" he said. Homan also offered another possible solution for \"those who are in the country illegally\": They \"should leave\" on their own, he said. Early in the Biden administration, then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas issued guidance to immigration enforcement officers discouraging them from \"spending resources to remove those who do not pose a threat\" and noting that many undocumented immigrants inside the country \"have been here for generations and contributed to our country's well-being,\" as he put it in a statement at the time. Homan, however, noted that the nation’s immigration laws were passed by Congress to be enforced, and said immigrants without legal status are violating those laws.

Aceasefire between Israel and Hamasin Gaza went into effect a week ago.Hostages held in the stripand Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails have started to be released under the multi-phased deal. Meanwhile, the November ceasefire in Lebanon is holding despite ongoing Israeli airstrikes on Hezbollah targets, which Israeli officials say are responses to ceasefire violations by the Iranian-backed militant group. Israeli forces also remain active inside the Syrian border region as victorious rebels there build a transitional government. Tensions remain high between Israel and Iran after tit-for-tat long-range strikes in recent months and threats of further military action from both sides. The IDF and the Yemeni Houthis also continue to exchange attacks. The death toll from an attack Sunday by the Israel Defense Forces in southern Lebanon has climbed to 22, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. At least 124 people have been injured in the attack, including nine children, the health ministry said. Sunday was supposed to be the last day of a ceasefire deal that saw the IDF completely withdraw from Lebanon, but the IDF remains in several areas in the south. -ABC News' Victoria Beaule Jordanian officials have rejected President Trump's comments about Egypt and Jordan \"taking\" in more displaced Palestinians. Jordan's position \"rejecting the displacement of Palestinians is fixed and unchangeable and is necessary to achieve the stability and peace that we all want,\" Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Ayman Safadi said during a Foreign Ministry press conference on Sunday.   \"We renew our position of rejecting the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza. Our position is that the two-state solution is the way to achieve peace, and our rejection of displacement is fixed and unchangeable,\" Safadi said, stressing that \"the solution to the Palestinian issue is a Palestinian solution, and Jordan is for Jordanians and Palestine is for Palestinians.\" Safadi added, \"Our approach is clear, to establish the Palestinians in their land and implement the two-state solution.\" Safadi said a priority now is to consolidate the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and bring aid to the residents of the area. ”We are working to bring aid into Gaza without interruption in preparation for the start of reconstruction operations,\" Safadi said. He said Jordon is looking forward to working with the U.S. administration to achieve peace in the region. -ABC News' Ghazi Balkiz Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted a short video message on social media on Sunday thanking President Donald Trump for his decision to resume shipments to Israel of the 2,000-pound bombs that former President Joe Biden halted. \"Thank you President Trump for keeping your promise to give Israel the tools it needs to defend itself, to confront our common enemies and to secure a future of peace and prosperity,\" Netanyahu said in apost on X. On Saturday, Trump ordered the U.S. to resume shipments of the 2,000-pound bombs to Israel. In May, Biden halted the shipments, claiming at the time that the weapons were being used in areas with high concentrations of civilians, leading to civilian deaths. -ABC News' Nate Luna and Michelle Stoddart In a statement Sunday, the Hamas-run Government Media Office in Gaza said it \"strongly\" condemns statements about what it described as the \"so-called transfer of Gaza citizens to neighboring countries.\" President Trump on Saturday spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One andsaid he spoke with King Abdullah II of Jordanabout taking more Palestinians from Gaza. \"I've gotten along with him over the years very well. He's done a wonderful job. He really houses, you know, millions of Palestinians, and he does it in a very humane way and I complimented him. But he really -- Jordan's done an amazing job of housing largely Palestinians,\" Trump said. He continued, \"I said to him that I'd love you to take on more 'cause I'm looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now and it's a mess, it's a real mess.\" When asked for clarification, Trump indicated he'd like Jordan and Egypt to take more Palestinians from Gaza. \"They can take people. I'd like Egypt to take people. I'm meeting with ... I'm talking with General El-Sisi tomorrow sometime. And I'd like Egypt to take people and I'd like Jordan to take people. I can -- you're talking about a million and a half people and we just clean out that whole thing,\" Trump said Saturday.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)           DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — From activists on the far right toElon Musk, allies of PresidentDonald Trumphave been quick to threaten primary challengers for Republican senators who don’t back hisCabinet picksand legislative priorities. In the case of Iowa’s Joni Ernst, conservatives threatened to run against her if she didn’t backTrump’s pick for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth— before she announced she would. Louisiana’s Bill Cassidy, a doctor before entering politics, is being closely watched for how he will questionRobert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s nominee for health secretary South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham, a Trump confidant, has long been targeted by the far right in his state and was booed at a home-state rally during the 2024 presidential campaign. The Associated Press talked to people connected to five senators who have been targeted online or by rivals in their states. Here’s a look at each of their potential races and what they face: Ernst prompted criticism from the right after she initially stopped short of endorsing Hegseth, who wasconfirmed by the Senateon Friday. Ernst voted “yes.” A retired Iowa National Guard lieutenant colonel and Iraq War veteran, Ernst is also a sexual assault survivor. After Trump announced Hegseth’s nomination, she said she hoped to discuss with him comments that he had made opposing women serving in combat roles, and about an allegation, which he denied and was not charged for, that he sexually assaulted a woman he met at a 2017 conference.  Hegseth, at Ernst’s suggestion, affirmed that that “every man and woman has opportunity to serve their country in uniform and to do so at any level as long as they are meeting the standards that are set forward.” Hegseth also said that if confirmed, he would appoint a senior-level official dedicated to sexual assault prevention and response. Potential challengers to Ernst: Conservative media figure Steve Deace, who posted on Facebook in December that “I don’t want to be a Senator, but I am willing to primary her for the good of the cause.” Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird wrote in a December opinion piece in Breitbart that some unnamed “D.C. politicians” thought “they can ignore the voices of their constituents and entertain smears” from news media outlets. That prompted speculation that Bird, who endorsed Trump before the 2024 Iowa caucuses, might challenge Ernst, who stayed neutral beforehand. Charlie Kirk of the conservative group Turning Point also called for Ernst to face a primary. An effort to boost Hegseth’s nomination led to Ernst’s office receiving thousands of calls. Cause for concern: Neither Deace nor Bird has taken any public steps toward running. Some prominent social conservatives are bothered by Ernst’s joining with a dozen Republicans and the Senate’s Democratic majority in 2022 to support repealing the Defense of Marriage Act to recognize the validity of same-sex marriages. But she remains popular with Iowa’s power players. “Anyone who says with a straight face that they are going to beat Joni Ernst in a primary today is kidding themselves,” said Luke Martz, an Iowa Republican consultant. “It would be a fool’s errand.” Tillis angered some on the right for not immediately supporting Trump’s first pick for attorney general, former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz. Though Gaetz withdrew from consideration, Tillis remains a frustration to some among North Carolina’s right wing, in part for voting to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act. Potential challengers: Andy Nilsson, a onetime candidate for lieutenant governor, has filed paperwork to challenge Tillis. The retired businessman has called for a return to the Reagan-Bush Republican ethos, hardly an attack from the right. Tillis faced three Republican challengers in 2020, all posing as more conservative than him. Cause for concern: Tillis has reason to expect a right-wing challenge. That faction helped lift former Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson to the 2024 nomination for governor last year. But North Carolina is expected to be among the most competitive states for Senate Republicans to hold in 2026. Roy Cooper, a Democrat who just finished two terms as governor, has not ruled out running for the seat. National Republicans are aware of the risks of nominating someone too far to the right. Cooper’s Democratic successor, Gov. Josh Stein, beat Robinson by nearly 15 percentage points in a state that Trump won by 3 points. To that end, Trump’s team and Tillis have been working together behind the scenes, said former Gov. Pat McCrory, a fellow Republican. “I anticipate there will be threats of challenging him from the right. But I also think he’ll deal with it as he has, with hard work and a record of accomplishment,” McCrory said. “I think the incoming administration sees that.” “They also see he’s the best chance of keeping North Carolina red,” he added. Cassidy remains vulnerable in large part due to his vote to convict Trump after his second impeachment over the siege of the U.S. Capitol. “Our Constitution and our country is more important than any one person. I voted to convict President Trump because he is guilty,” Cassidy said in a statement after the February 2021 vote. Cassidy, in his second term, has not yet announced whether he will seek a third. A gastroenterologist before he entered politics, Cassidy will be closely watched for how he votes on Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic who has questioned medical consensus on several issues. Potential challengers: Cassidy has already drawn a Republican challenger, state Treasurer John Fleming. Fleming, a former U.S. House member from northern Louisiana, has said Cassidy’s impeachment vote “failed” Louisiana. Former U.S. Rep. Garrett Graves of Baton Rouge is also a potential challenger, as is Blake Miguez, a state senator from New Iberia. Louisiana last year did away with its 50-year tradition of “jungle primaries,” where candidates from all parties ran in the same contest in November. Cassidy would now run in a closed Republican primary that might be more difficult if he faces one strong Trump-aligned challenger. Cause for concern: Cassidy’s vote to convict Trump remains a sticking point for Republicans in a state the president won with 60% last year. But Cassidy is viewed as having strong constituent relations and visibility in the state, political observers say. “Aside from that vote, I think he’s considered a good senator, and good at constituent work,” said Ellen Carmichael, a Louisiana Republican consultant and president of Washington-based Lafayette Company. “The base is unhappy with the vote he cast. But I wouldn’t count him out.” Cornyn in the past has been criticized within his own party for being too willing to work with Democrats and has drawn boos at GOP conventions in Texas. Commentator Tucker Carlson and others have urged a primary challenge against him. Last year, Cornyn told the Dallas Morning News that, “God willing,” he would seek reelection in 2026. According to federal filings, Cornyn had more than $3.5 million on hand in toward the end of 2024. Potential challengers: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is one of the state’s most powerful Republicans and also suggested Cornyn should be primaried. Paxton was acquitted in a 2023 impeachment effort and fraud charges against him were dropped last year. Cornyn and Paxton have sniped at each other on X, with Paxton calling Cornyn “anti-Trump” and “anti-gun” and the senator firing back, “Hard to run from prison, Ken.” Cause for concern: Brendan Steinhauser, a Republican strategist who has worked on Cornyn’s previous campaigns, noted that the senator remains undefeated in elections. “He’s never taken a race for granted. I would expect him to work extremely hard and crisscross the state of Texas to earn every vote possible in this upcoming election, assuming he has a primary challenger,” Steinhauser said. “I think it’s important for him to show the ways that he has worked with President Trump to enact the conservative America First agenda, and I would expect that would be a big part of his campaign message in a potential upcoming primary.” Seeking his fifth term, Graham will likely face primary challenges — he always has. County-level Republican parties have censured him a number of times for his willingness to work on bipartisan deals. One such measure derided Graham’s “condescending attitude” to the party’s grassroots organizers. He has even drawn boos at some events of the party faithful in his home state. That includes aJuly 2023 Trump rallyin Pickens — in the county where Graham grew up — where objections from the crowd drowned out more than five minutes of his remarks. When he took the stage, Trump also elicited boos when he mentioned Graham’s name. Graham has named a campaign leadership team, which says he has more than $15 million on hand, including nearly $1 million raised in the final quarter of 2024. Potential challengers: Rep. Ralph Norman represents South Carolina’s 5th Congressional District south of Charlotte, North Carolina, and is a member of the House Freedom Caucus. Another possible opponent could be Adam Morgan, a former South Carolina legislator who lost a primary bid last year against another congressman, Rep. William Timmons. Cause for concern: While he was highly critical of Trump in 2016 when they competed for the Republican nomination, Graham has backed Trump ever since his first administration, frequently serving as his golf partner and Capitol Hill surrogate. Trump has backed him in turn. When the crowd in Pickens booed Graham’s name, Trump said he was “going to have to work on these people” and added that Graham is “there when you need him.” Kinnard reported from Washington.

(AP Photo/John Raoux)     DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Roger Penske started his 59th season in motorsports the same way he closed last year — as a champion. Porsche Penske Motorsport on Sunday won the Rolex 24 at Daytona for the second consecutive year, and third time overall, to continue the domination “The Captain” flexed all of last season. Penske opened 2024 by winning the most prestigious sports car race in North America, added a 20th victory in the Indianapolis 500, won a second consecutive NASCAR championship and his pair of Porsches won both the World Endurance Championship title and the IMSA crown. Now back at Daytona International Speedway for the Rolex, the same place and race where Team Penske debuted in 1966, Penske returned to victory lane. And, as he always does, the billionaire who turns 88 next month stayed awake and sat with the team on the timing stand for the entire 24 hours. His two cars dominated the twice-round-the-clock endurance race and finished 1-2. Once attrition hit other entries in the top prototype class, the Porsches ran first and second for large portions of the race. It was the No. 7 full-time IMSA entry that won, making it back-to-back victories for that car despite a different driver lineup. Felipe Nasr won last year with Dane Cameron and Josef Newgarden, but Cameron was let go at the end of 2024 and Newgarden wasn’t part of this year’s Rolex lineup. So it was Nasr again, only this time he was paired with Nick Tandy, who will be his IMSA co-driver all season, and Laurens Vanthoor, Penske’s reigning WEC champion.  It was Nasr’s second overall victory, and he also won a Rolex watch for a class victory in 2022. Tandy also earned a Rolex with a 2014 class victory, but Sunday was his first overall win. It was the first watch for Vanthoor, who had finished in the top five of class in six of the last seven years. Nasr said it is Penske who pushes the team to achieve the excellence he demands. “The feeling is amazing, just to see how much energy he brings into the team. You get out of the car, he’s like: ‘How’s the car? How’s the handling?’ Like, he’s very interested in every detail,” Nasr said. “He doesn’t miss a pit stop when the cars are coming in, and he’s looking at it all and making comments. I just have a lot of admiration for everything he does, and it stands for the team. It’s a very, very unique opportunity to be driving for Porsche Penske Motorsport here.” Even though the No. 7 was so dominant — especially after sunrise on Sunday — the drivers were still challenged until the checkered flag. Penske’s No. 6 car took the lead with just under an hour to go, but Nasr bested Matt Campbell in a drag race through traffic to cycle back to the front with about 22 minutes remaining. BMW M Team RLL had a pair of competitive entries and one of its cars went wheel-to-wheel with Nasr for the lead with about 100 minutes remaining. Getting the win Sunday meant beating 60 other cars in a field of 235 drivers representing 31 countries. The lineups included 14 former Formula 1 drivers, including Nasr. Kevin Magnussen, who concluded his 10-year F1 career in December, has the most recent experience in motorsports’ elite global series and was a contender with BMW for overall victory. Rahal’s two cars led and contended with the Porsches but had issues that prevented them from keeping consistent pace with the Penske entries. Same for Meyer Shank Racing, which had a suspension issue early Saturday that took one car out of contention, then its second car suffered front damage when Felix Rosenqvist was leading. All three Cadillacs in the prototype class had issues — one of Wayne Taylor Racing’s entries was knocked out of the race Saturday night not long after two-time Rolex winner Kamui Kobayashi had driven it to the lead.

        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "Researchers say they are puzzled over the discovery. Astronomers have detected fast-repeating radio bursts from a distant \"dead\" galaxy that should not contain the energy to produce these types of signals, according to new research. The source of the fast radio bursts (FRBs) -- sudden flashes of radio waves that last just milliseconds -- has previously been linked to young, magnetized neutron stars that expend a lot of energy when they are forming. But the dormant galaxy from which these radio bursts are originating should not contain this type of young star, according to a paper published Wednesday inThe Astrophysical Journal Letters. Researchers expect FRBs to originate inside of a galaxy and, because these FRBs are so energetic, within a region of a galaxy in which new stars are actively forming, Vishwangi Shah, a PhD student in the Department of Physics and the Trottier Space Institute at McGill University, told ABC News. These FRBs, named FRB 20240209A, are located outside of the massive ancient elliptical galaxy it is associated with that only contains old and dead stars, Shah said. \"This discovery was really surprising and exciting,\" she said. Shah and her team used the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment -- also known as the CHIME telescope -- to detect the multiple bursts from the same location, Shah said. But because the CHIME telescope could not pinpoint the exact location of the radio waves, they combined it with a smaller CHIME-like telescope to pinpoint the location of the FRB. They then used the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii to image the region around the location of the FRBs. The Gemini image confirmed that there is no other galaxy present near the FRB and the FRB is indeed associated with the dead galaxy. \"There's no other galaxy there,\" Shah said. The ancient elliptical galaxy where astronomers discovered the radio waves is about 2 billion light-years from Earth and is about 11.3 billion years old, according to the paper. Thousands of radio bursts have been recorded since 2007, when they were first discovered by astronomers, Shah said, adding that they only know the precise locations of about 100 of them -- all near actively forming stars. \"This particular FRB is really an outlier, and it challenges our theories about what is producing FRBs,\" Shah said. Astronomers hypothesize that the FRBs could be originating from two supernova remnants, called neutron stars, that are merging or collapsing onto themselves, Shah said. Continuing to study these FRBs will allow researchers to further understand the space between its origination and the Milky Way as well as what is happening in distant regions of space, Shah said. \"That is why it is a really useful probe of our universe,\" she said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(Andrew Esola via AP)             ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — North America’s tallest peak is a focal point of Jeff King’s life. The four-time winner of the 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometer) Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race operates his kennel and mushing tourism business just 8 miles (12.87 kilometers) fromDenali National Park and Preserve’s entrance, and the 20,310-foot (6,190-meter) mountain looms large as he trains his dogs on nearby trails. King and many others who live in the mountain’s shadow say most Alaskans will never stop calling the peak Denali,its Alaska Native name, despitePresident Donald Trump’s executive orderthat the namerevert to Mount McKinley-- an identifier inspired byPresident William McKinley, who was from Ohio and never set foot in Alaska. For many who live near Denali, Trump’s suggestion was peculiar. “I don’t know a single person that likes the idea, and we’re pretty vocal about it,” King said. “Denali respects the Indigenous people that have been here and around Denali for tens of thousands of years.” The mountain was named after McKinleywhen a prospector walked out of the Alaska wildernessin 1896, and the first news he heard was that the Republican had been nominated for president. The name was quickly challenged, but maps had already been circulated with the mountain’s name in place. At the time, there was no recognition of the name Denali, or “the high one,” bestowed on the mountain in interior Alaska by Athabascan tribal members, who have lived in the region for centuries.  The McKinley name stuck until 2015, whenPresident Barack Obama’s administrationchanged it to Denali as a symbolic gesture to Alaska Natives on the eve of his Alaska visit tohighlight climate change. Trump said he issued the order to “restore the name of a great president, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs. President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent.” The area lies solely in the United States, and Trump, as president, has the authority to change federal geographical names within the country. In Ohio, Trump’s move drew praise. “I was really excited to see President Trump do that executive order,” former U.S. Rep. Bob Gibbs, R-Ohio, told The Associated Press by telephone Thursday. McKinley “was a great president,” Gibbs said. “It was the appropriate thing to do.” That’s not how Alaskans see it. Trump injected “a jarring note” into Alaska affairs, Steve Haycox, professor emeritus of history at the University of Alaska Anchorage, wrote inthe Anchorage Daily News. “Historical analysis confirms that William McKinley is the wrong public figure for Alaskans to commemorate,” he said. McKinley served as president from 1897 until he was assassinated in 1901. He was an imperial colonialist who oversaw the expansion of the American empire with the occupation of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Philippines andHawaii, pushed by business interests and Christian missionaries wanting to convert Indigenous peoples, Haycox said. “Trump’s push to rescind the name Denali for the colonialist and white elitist McKinley is insulting to all Alaskans, especially to Alaska’s Native people, and should be soundly rejected,” Haycox said. John Wayne Howe, who unsuccessfully ran for U.S. House last year representing the Alaskan Independence Party, which holds that Alaskans should be allowed to vote on becoming an independent nation, said he is tired of “people changing the names of stuff, period.” He also is not in favor of naming anything after people because “the persons that we consider absolutely perfect change over time, and it just leads to confusion.” Howe said he prefers Denali because he knows McKinley’s history and it’s the name most preferred by Alaskans. This past week, two resolutions were introduced in the Alaska Legislature to keep the name Denali. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Trump ally who praised another order by the president aimed at spurring resource development in the state, said he had not had a chance to speak with Trump about the issue but hoped to have a conversation next month in Washington about what Denali means to Alaskans, Americans and “our Native folks.” But Sarah Palin, a former Republican governor who is also a Trump supporter, said the McKinley name should never have been removed. Palin’s Secret Service code name was Denali in 2008 when she was GOP presidential nominee John McCain’s running mate the year they lost to Obama and Joe Biden. But in an interview with Al Arabiya News this past week, Palin said she didn’t see why the mountain’s name needed to be changed to begin with. “It’s always been Mount McKinley,” said Palin, who didn’t respond to a message from The Associated Press. “Nobody was begging for a change in name in that peak. Just put it back the way it was, more common sense.” Alaska’s U.S. senators, Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, have supported the name Denali. U.S. Rep. Nick Begich, a first-term Republican, sidestepped the debate. “I’m focused on job creation, opportunities in Alaska,” Begich told Politico. “And what we call a mountain in Alaska is of little concern to me.” The Alaska Native Heritage Center, the statewide Indigenous cultural center in Anchorage, supports preserving Indigenous place names. “Restoring and honoring them acknowledges the deep, millennia-old connection Indigenous peoples maintain with these lands and is a step toward respect and reconciliation,” the center’s president, Emily Edenshaw, said in a statement. The quirky Alaska community of Talkeetna, about 140 miles (225.3 kilometers) south of the park and wherea cat was once mayor, is the jumping off point for climbers before making the ascent of the peak. The historic community long rumored to be the inspiration for the 1990s television series “Northern Exposure” is also a popular tourist stop. Joe McAneney of Talkeetna worked as a summer raft-guide for two years before moving to Alaska full time in 2012. He’s now a pilot for an air taxi company, ferrying climbers and tourists to the mountain in a small airplane outfitted with skis to land atbase camp, located on Kahiltna Glacierat 7,200 feet (2,194.6 meters) above sea level. He knows once tourist season comes around, he will have to answer their questions of what he thinks about Trump changing the name. He knows what his answer will be. “It’s always been Denali, and it always will be,” he said. The executive order can instigate the name change, but compliance is another issue. “The only people that are going to adhere to that are probably the people that would have been still calling it McKinley anyway,” McAneney said There is a long-standing Alaska trait of ignoring what the rest of the world thinks, and it’s usually expressed like this: “We don’t care how they do it Outside.” Outside, which is always capitalized, refers to every place that is not Alaska. “I think unofficially and officially in Alaska, it’ll always be Denali,” McAneney said. “I don’t think the president can change that.” For King, the decorated Iditarod musher and fan favorite, Trump’s decision had a whiff of arrogance. “I’m surprised he doesn’t want to name it Trump Mountain,” he said.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)                                                       MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — There’s all sorts of ways beyond merely the score to measure just how dominantJannik Sinnerwas while outplaying and frustratingAlexander Zverevduring the 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 victory Sunday that earned the 23-year-old Italian a second consecutiveAustralian Openchampionship.  The zero break points Sinner faced. Or the 10 he accumulated. The 27-13 advantage in points that lasted at least nine strokes. Or the way Sinner accumulated more winners, 32 to 25, and fewer unforced errors, 27 to 45. The way Sinner won 10 of the 13 points that ended with him at the net. Or the way he only let Zverev go 14 of 27 in that category, frequently zipping passing shots out of reach.  Well, here’s is one more bit of evidence: what Zverev said about Sinner.  “I’m serving better than him, but that’s it. He does everything else better than me. He moves better than me. He hits his forehand better than me. He hits his backhand better than me. He returns better than me. He volleys better than me,” Zverev said. “At the end of the day, tennis has five or six massive shots — like, massive factors — and he does four or five of them better than me. That’s the reason why he won.”  High praise from a guy who is, after all, ranked No. 2. Sinner has held the No. 1 spot since last June andis not showing any signs of relinquishing it. This was the first Australian Open final between the men at No. 1 and No. 2 since 2019, whenNo. 1 Novak Djokovic defeated No. 2 Rafael Nadal— also in straight sets.  “It’s amazing,” Sinner said, “to achieve these things.”   The “things” include being the youngest man to leave Melbourne Park with the trophy two years in a row since Jim Courier in 1992-93, and the first man sinceNadalat the French Open in 2005 and 2006 to follow up his firstGrand Slamtitle by repeating as the champion at the same tournament a year later. Jannik Sinner of Italy, right, and Alexander Zverev of Germany walk past each other during the men’s singles final at the Australian Open tennis championship in Melbourne, Australia, Sunday, Jan. 26, 2025. (AP Photo/Manish Swarup)   Sinner was asked later whether he felt more relief or excitement when he raised his arms after the last point was his.  “This one was joy. We managed to do something incredible this time, because the situation I was in was completely different from a year ago here,” he said. “I had more pressure.”  Probably true, but’s hard to tell.  Go to the start of 2024, and take stock. In that span, Sinner has won three of the five major tournaments, including the U.S. Open in September, meaning he now has claimed three straight hard-court Slams. His record is 80-6 with nine titles. His current unbeaten run covers 21 matches.  “There’s always something that can get better,” said one of his two coaches, Simone Vagnozzi. “He is playing really well right now and everything comes easily. But there will be tough moments ahead.”  The only thing that’s clouded the past 12 months for Sinner, it seems,is the doping casein which his exoneration was appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency. He tested positive for a trace amount of an anabolic steroid twice last March but blamed it on an accidental exposure involving two members of his team who have since been fired. Sinner initially was cleared in August; ahearing in the WADA appealis scheduled for April.  “I keep playing like this because I have a clear mind on what happened,” Sinner said Sunday. “I know if I would be guilty, I would not play like this.”  While he became the eighth man in the Open era (which began in 1968) to start his career 3-0 in Grand Slam finals,Zverev is the seventh to be 0-3, adding this loss to those at the 2020 U.S. Open and last year’s French Open.  Those earlier setbacks both came in five sets. This contest was not that close. Not at all.  “I’ll keep doing everything I can,” Zverev said, “to lift one of those trophies.”  Just beforeZverev began speakinginto a microphone during the trophy ceremony, a voice cried out from the stands, making reference to two of the player’s ex-girlfriends whoaccused him of physical abuse.  During the match, there truly was only one moment that contained a hint of tension. It came when Zverev was two points from owning the second set at 5-4, love-30. But a break point — and a set point — never arrived.  A year ago, Sinner went through a lot more trouble to earn his first major, needing to get past Novak Djokovic —who quit one set into his semifinalagainst Zverev on Friday because of a torn hamstring — beforeerasing a two-set deficit in the finalagainst 2021 U.S. Open champion Daniil Medvedev.  This time, Sinner applied pressure with an all-around style that does not really appear to have holes.  He proved superior in every meaningful way other than aces, leaving Zverev shaking his head or trudging to the sideline with shoulders sagging or cracking his racket against the court or against another racket.  Perfectly understandable, given what Sinner can do to an opponent, especially on a hard court.  “The facts speak for themselves,” Zverev said. “He’s in a different universe right now.”   Howard Fendrich has been the AP’s tennis writer since 2002.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)               SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean prosecutors on Sunday indictedimpeached President Yoon Suk Yeolon rebellion in connection with his short-lived imposition of martial law, a criminal charge that could incur the death penalty or life imprisonment if convicted. This is thelatest blow to Yoon, who was impeached and arrested over his Dec. 3 martial law decree that plunged the country intopolitical turmoil, shook its financial markets and hurt its international image. Separate from criminal judicial proceedings, the Constitutional Court is now deliberating whether to formally dismiss Yoon as president or reinstate him. Yoon has become South Korea’s first president who has been indicted while in office. He will remain jailed and be escorted from a detention facility to a Seoul court for hearings in the trial, which is expected to last about six months. Prosecutors said in a statement that they indicted Yoon on charges that he directed a rebellion when he imposed martial law. Investigative authorities have earlier alleged that Yoon’s imposition of martial law amounted to rebellion, because he staged riots with the purpose of undermining the constitution. Yoon’s defense team lashed out at the indictment, calling it “the worst decision” by prosecutors who they say are trying to curry favor with political forces who want Yoon’s exit. “Today’s indictment of the president will remain as a shame in the history of South Korean prosecutors that they cannot erase,” Yoon’s defense team said in a statement. “We stress once again that a president’s declaration of martial law can never be rebellion.”  Yoon has presidential immunity from most criminal prosecutions, but the privilege doesn’t extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. By law in South Korea, the leader of a rebellion can face a life sentence or capital punishment. Yoon, a conservative, has steadfastlydenied any wrongdoing, describing his declaration of martial law as a legitimate act of governance meant to raise public awareness of the danger of the liberal-controlled National Assembly, which obstructed his agenda and impeached top officials. During his announcement of martial law, Yoon called the assembly “a den of criminals” and vowed to eliminate “shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces.” After declaring martial law on Dec. 3, Yoon sent troops and police officers to the assembly, but enough lawmakers still managed to enter an assembly chamber to vote down Yoon’s decree unanimously, forcing his Cabinet to lift it. The martial law imposition,the first of its kindin South Korea in more than four decades, lasted only six hours. However, it evoked painful memories of past dictatorial rules in South Korea in the 1960s-80s when military-backed rulers used martial laws and emergency decrees to suppress opponents. South Korea’s constitution gives the president the power to declare martial law to keep order in wartime and other comparable emergency states, but many experts say the country wasn’t under such conditions when Yoon declared martial law. Yoon insists that he hadno intentions of disrupting assembly work, including its floor vote on his decree and that deploying troops and police forces was meant to maintain order. But commanders of military units sent to the assembly have told assembly hearings or investigators that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to prevent them from overturning his decree. Investigations on Yoon have intensified the country’s already serious internal division,with rival protestersregularly staging rallies in downtown Seoul. After a local court on Jan. 19 approved a formal arrest warrant to extend Yoon’s detention, dozens of his supporters stormed the court building, destroying windows, doors and other property. They also attacked police officers with bricks, steel pipes and other objects. The violence left 17 police officers injured, and police said that they detained 46 protesters. Yoon earlier resisted efforts by investigative authorities to question or detain him.He then was apprehended on Jan. 15in a huge law enforcement operation at his presidential compound. Leading Yoon’s investigation was the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, but Yoon has refused to attend CIO questioning sessions since being detained, saying it has no legal authority to investigate rebellion allegations. The CIO has said that it can investigate Yoon’s rebellion allegation because it’s related to his purported abuse of power and other allegations. The CIO handed over Yoon’s case to the Seoul prosecutors’ office on Friday and asked it to indict him on charges of rebellion, abuse of power and obstruction of the National Assembly. Prosecutors said they indicted Yoon only on rebellion, considering that Yoon had presidential immunity from other charges. Yoon’s defense minister, police chief and several other military commanders have already been arrested on alleged rebellion, abuse of power and other charges related to the martial law decree. If the Constitutional Court rules to drive Yoon out of office, a national election to choose his successor must be held within two months. Recent public surveys show that governing and opposition party candidates are running neck-and-neck in a possible presidential by-election race.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

        "content": "Officials say they have recaptured the final four monkeys who escaped two months ago from a South Carolina compound that breeds them for medical research YEMASSEE, S.C. --Authorities in South Carolina said Friday the last four of 43 escaped monkeys have been recaptured after two months living in the woods, weathering arare snowstormand being temped back into captivity by peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. The rhesus macaque monkeys, all females, made a break for it after police say an employee did notfully lock their enclosureat Alpha Genesis, a facility that breeds them for medical research — known to locals as “the monkey farm.” The recaptured monkeys appeared to be in good health, Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard said in a statement relayed by Yemassee Police in a social media post, without further details. While they were on the loose, the area saw its first snow in seven years, accumulating up to 3 inches (8 centimeters). The rhesus macaques made a break for it on Nov. 6, and mostly hung around near the facility. They're about the size of a cat, weighing roughly 7 pounds (3 kilograms). It appears a worker unintentionally left the gates unlocked when the monkeys escaped, Westergaard said in November. Workers were supposed to lock and latch one gate before opening another, but all three gates and latches were left unsecure. The monkeys posed no risk to public health, said Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police. Alpha Guard employees kept an eye on the monkeys and set out humane traps. Most were lured back with food and were given peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and \"monkey biscuits\" — a high-protein Purina Monkey Chow specially formulated for the rhesus macaques. The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical facilities and other researchers. Humans have beenusing the monkeys for scientific researchsince the late 1800s. Scientists believe rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25 million years ago and share about 93% of the same DNA. The compound is about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee and about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "Palestinians face challenges of rebuilding lives torn apart by Gaza war. Gaza has become a wasteland of ruins and rubble due to Israel's conflict with Hamas following the terror organization's surprise attack on Oct. 7, 2023. However, now that a ceasefire is in place, families are returning to their neighborhoods, hoping to rebuild the places they once called home. One of the families excited to be back is the Ghaly family. After leaving the tents they had lived in for months, they are taking the few possessions they still have. As they returned to see the rubble, evidence of the destructive force where no building was left untouched, they also saw their family home. \"This is our four-story home,\" Eyad Abu Ghaly said. \"It has been completely flattened, and there was no reason for that. We don’t understand why the house was bombed.\" Eyad further explains, “The resistance does not exist here — just civilians.” Many homes that are still standing are wrecked inside, and as people wonder how they will ever rebuild, there’s also fear that war will soon return. \"I look at young people and wonder, 'Where will they go?'\" Ghaly said. \"There’s no future for them — no education, no health care. There is no life, no life at all.\" The agreement between Hamas and Israel, which ended the fighting and resulted in three Israeli hostages being freed on Sunday and reuniting with their families, was initially based on a six-week ceasefire. On Inauguration Day, President Donald Trump stated he was not confident that a second phase of the deal could be reached to prolong the truce and free all remaining hostages, both living and deceased. Tal Haimi was killed in the Oct. 7 massacre, but his body was taken into Gaza by Hamas. His cousin, Udi Goren, said that if Israel prioritizes the release of all hostages, it will further weaken Hamas. \"It is in our interest,\" Goren said. \"Bring back the hostages because that's more valuable to Hamas than anything else. And once we have the hostages back home, then we need to keep doing what we're actually doing right now, collaborating with the mediators in creating a different future for Gaza, where Hamas is not a part of it.\" But as soon as the ceasefire kicked in in Gaza, Hamas gunmen were parading through the streets. Then, the hostage handover was used to show they were back in charge. With no sign that Hamas is willing to capitulate, a former Israeli general close to the Israeli government states that it is unlikely the six-week ceasefire will be prolonged. Retired Israel Defense Forces Brigadier General Amir Avivi told ABC News that Israel is discussing a second deal. Yet this deal involves not just the release of hostages, but also requires Hamas to surrender, relinquish its control over Gaza, and vacate the area. \"And we will have to pressure and continue degrading Hamas capabilities to an extent where they will understand that it's game over,\" Avivi said. While teams in Gaza search the rubble for more bodies, there is no clear sense of who or what could govern Gaza if Hamas were to be removed. According to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, the war has already claimed 47,000 lives. Some 1,200 were killed in southern Israel during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, according to Israeli officials. In examining Gaza before the war and observing the devastation now, aid agencies warn that thousands more dead have not yet been counted or found. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(AP Photo/Ohad Zwigenberg) Hundreds of Palestinian families crowded on the upper edge of southern Gaza on Sunday, waiting for the Israeli military to allow their return to their homes in the northern half of the coastal enclave. Palestinian families have been displaced from the northern Gaza Strip since October 2023 when the Israel-Hamas war erupted. According to the ceasefire deal, the Israeli military had been expected to allow hundreds of thousands of Palestinian to return to northern Gaza through a road that bisects the territory starting Sunday. Israel has yet to allow Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza on foot through the so-called Netzarim corridor bisecting the territory, which extends from the Wadi Gaza river valley to Gaza City. It put the move on hold until Hamas freed a hostage who Israel said was supposed to have been released that day. (Production by Wafaa Shurafa) Israel has said that it needs to stay longer because the Lebanese army has not deployed to all areas of southern Lebanon to ensure that Hezbollah does not reestablish a military presence in the area. (AP Video shot by Bassam Al Masri)                                     DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel kept thousands of Palestinians from returning to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday as it accused Hamas of violatinga fragile ceasefireby changing the order of hostages it has released. Local health officials said Israeli forces fired on the crowd, killing two people and wounding nine. Israeli forcesalso opened fire in Lebanonon protesters demanding their withdrawal by Sunday’s deadline under a separate ceasefire with the Hezbollah militant group. Health officials in Lebanon said at least 22 people were killed and over 120 wounded. Israel says it hasn’t withdrawn because Lebanese forces are not deploying quickly enough, while Lebanon says its forces cannot move into areas until Israeli troops leave. U.S. President Donald Trump meanwhile suggested that most of Gaza’s populationbe at least temporarily resettled elsewhere, including in Egypt and Jordan, to “just clean out” the war-ravaged enclave. Jordan and the Palestinians swiftly rejected that, and Egypt has previously rejected the scenario, fearing Israelmight never allow refugees to return. Senior Hamas official Bassem Naim said Palestinians would never accept such a proposal, “even if seemingly well-intentioned under the guise of reconstruction.” He said the Palestinians can rebuild Gaza “even better than before”if Israel lifts its blockade. Under the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, Israel on Saturday was to begin allowing Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza throughthe Netzarim corridorbisecting the territory. Israel put that on hold until Hamas frees a civilian hostage who Israel said should have been released Saturday. Hamas accused Israel of violating the agreement.  Crowds of people carrying their belongings filled a main road leading to a closed Israeli checkpoint. “We have been in agony for a year and a half,” said Nadia Qasem. Fadi al-Sinwar, also displaced from Gaza City, said “the fate of more than a million people is linked to one person,” referring to the Israeli hostage, Arbel Yehoud. “See how valuable we are? We are worthless,” he said. Israeli forces fired on the crowds on three occasions overnight and into Sunday, killing two people and wounding nine, including a child, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. Israel’s military in a statement said it fired warning shots at “several gatherings of dozens of suspects who were advancing toward the troops and posed a threat to them.” Israel has pulled back from several areas of Gaza under the ceasefire, which came into effect last Sunday. The military has warned people to stay away from its forces, which still operate in a buffer zone inside Gaza along the border and in the Netzarim corridor. Hamasfreed four female Israeli soldierson Saturday, and Israel released some 200 Palestinian prisoners, most of whom were serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks. But Israel said Yehoud should have been released ahead of the soldiers. The release of four Israeli hostages Saturday comes nearly a week into a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and is part of a long and uncertain process aimed at eventually ending the war. The AP’s Sam Mednick explains. Israel also accused Hamas of failing to provide details on the conditions of hostages set to be freed in the remaining five weeks of the ceasefire’s first phase. In a statement, Hamas said it had told mediators — the United States, Egypt and Qatar — that Yehoud was alive and provided guarantees that she would be released. A spokesman for Gaza’s second-largest militant group, Islamic Jihad, later said the dispute over Yehoud had been settled. Mohamed al-Hajj Mousa said the group told mediators she will be released before Saturday. But an Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the behind-the-scenes talks, said there was still no deal. The ceasefire is aimed at ending the 15-month war triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack and freeing hostages still held in Gaza in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Around 90 hostages are still in Gaza, and Israeli authorities believe at least a third, and up to half, have died. Itzik Horn, the father of hostages Iair and Eitan Horn, called any resumption of fighting “a death sentence for the hostages” and criticized government ministers who want the war to go on. The ceasefire’s first phase runs until early March and includes the release of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The second — and far more difficult — phase, has yet to be negotiated. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining hostages without an end to the war, while Israel has threatened to resume its offensive until Hamas is destroyed. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 attack, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. More than 100 were freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the remains of dozens more, at least three of them mistakenly killed by Israeli forces. Seven have been freed in the latest ceasefire. Israel’s military campaign has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not say how many of the dead were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. Israeli bombardment and ground operationshave flattened wide swaths of Gazaand displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. Many who have returned home since the ceasefire began have found only mounds of rubble. Magdy reported from Cairo and Krauss from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

NASA’s four Magnetospheric Multiscale, or MMS, satellites at the Astrotech Space Operations facility in Titusville, Florida, March 2015. (NASA via AP) NEW YORK (AP) — Scientists have detected cosmic waves thatsound like birds chirpingin an unexpected place. These bursts of plasma, called chorus waves, ripple at the same frequency ashuman hearing. When converted to audio signals, their sharp notes mimichigh-pitched bird calls. Researchers have captured such sounds in space before, but now they have sensed the chirping waves from much farther away: over 62,000 miles (100,000 kilometers) from Earth, where they’ve never been measured before. “That opens up a lot of new questions about the physics that could be possible in this area,” said Allison Jaynes, a space physicist at the University of Iowa who was not involved with the work. AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on scientists sensing a chirping chorus in an unexpected place. Scientists still aren’t sure how the perturbations happen, but they thinkEarth’s magnetic fieldmay have something to do with it. The chorus has been picked up on radio antennas for decades, including receivers at an Antarctica research station in the 1960s. And twin spacecraft — NASA’s Van Allen Probes — heard the chirps from Earth’s radiation belts at a closer distance than the newest detection. The latest notes were picked up by NASA’s Magnetospheric Multiscale satellites, launched in 2015 to explore the Earth and sun’s magnetic fields. The new researchwas published Wednesdayin the journal Nature. Chorus waves have also been spotted near other planets including Jupiter and Saturn. They can even produce high-energy electrons capable of scrambling satellite communications.   “They are one of the strongest and most significant waves in space,” said study author Chengming Liu from Beihang University in an email. The newfound chorus waves were detected in a region where Earth’s magnetic field is stretched out, which scientists didn’t expect. That raises fresh questions about how these chirping waves form. “It’s very captivating, very compelling,” Jaynes said. “We definitely need to find more of these events.” The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

A South Korean court issued an arrest and search warrant on Dec. 31.

(AP Photo/Brittany Peterson)             LOS ANGELES (AP) — After weeks of windy and dry weather, rain has fallen in parched Southern California and is expected to aid firefighters who are mopping up multiple wildfires. But potentially heavy downpours on charred hillsides could bring new troubles such astoxic ash runoff. Los Angeles County crews spent much of the past week removing vegetation, shoring up slopes and reinforcing roads in devastated areas of thePalisades and Eaton fires, which reduced entire neighborhoods to rubble and ash after breaking out during powerful winds Jan. 7. Most of the region was forecast to get around an inch (about 2.5 centimeters) of precipitation over several days, but “the threat is high enough to prepare for the worst-case scenario” of localized cloudbursts causing mud and debris to flow down hills, the National Weather Service said on social media. “So the problem would be if one of those showers happens to park itself over a burn area,” weather service meteorologist Carol Smith said. “That could be enough to create debris flows.” Rainfall that began late Saturday was expected to increase Sunday and possibly last into early Tuesday, forecasters said. Flood watches were issued for some burn areas, while snow was likely in the mountains. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bassissued an executive order last weekto expedite cleanup efforts and mitigate the environmental impacts of fire-related pollutants. LA County supervisors also approved an emergency motion to install flood-control infrastructure and expedite and remove sediment in fire-impacted areas.  Fire crews filled sandbags for communities, while county workers installed barriers and cleared drainage pipes and basins. Officials cautioned that ash in recent burn zones wasa toxic mixof incinerated cars, electronics, batteries, building materials, paints, furniture and other household items. It contains pesticides, asbestos, plastics and lead. Residents were urged to wear protective gear while cleaning up. Concerns about post-fire debris flows have been especially high since 2018, when the town of Montecito, up the coast from LA, wasravaged by mudslidesafter a downpour hit mountain slopes burned bare by a huge blaze. Hundreds of homes were damaged and 23 people died. While the impending wet weather ended weeks of dangerous gusts and reduced humidity, several wildfires were still burning Saturday across Southern California. Those included the Palisades and Eaton fires, whichkilled at least 28 peopleand destroyed more than 14,000 structures. Containment of the Palisades Fire reached 81% on Saturday and the Eaton Fire was 95% contained.

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)  In northern Los Angeles County, firefighters made significant progress against the Hughes Fire, which prompted evacuations for tens of thousands of people when it erupted on Wednesday in mountains near Lake Castaic. In San Diego County, there was still little containment of the Border 2 Fire as it burned through a remote area of the Otay Mountain Wilderness near the U.S.-Mexico border. The rain was expected to snap a near-record streak of dry weather for Southern California. Much of the region has received less than 5% of the average rainfall for this point in the water year, which began Oct. 1, the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday. Most of Southern California is currently in “extreme drought” or “severe drought,” according to theU.S. Drought Monitor.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(Photo by CJ Rivera/Invision/AP)                     NEW YORK (AP) — To celebrate an upcoming milestone, Alyssa Math could think of nothing more fitting than front-row tickets to “Onyx Storm” author Rebecca Yarros’ appearance at The Town Hall in Manhattan. “I’m getting married next weekend, so this is my bachelorette party,” said Math, an accountant who traveled with friends from her home near Annapolis, Maryland. She has been one of millions of admirers of Yarros’ work and a year ago drove two hours to Reston, Virginia, to see the author. “It’s a huge cult following,” said Math, wearing a white veil in homage to one of Yarros’ characters. “The drama (of her books) keeps you on the edge of your seat.” Friday night at The Town Hall had the feel of a costume party, rock concert and family reunion as a capacity crowd of around 1,500 clapped, laughed and shouted, “Yes, Queen!” The “Empyrean” series has made Yarros one of the country’s most popular and obsessed-about leaders of romantasy, a newly branded genre combinging romance and fantasy. “Onyx Storm” is the much-awaited third installment of a planned five centered on the lovers Violet and Xaden, and the first since the million-selling “Iron Flame” came out in 2023. In its first week of publication, “Onyx Storm” has already topped the bestseller lists of Amazon and sold more than 300,000 copies just through Barnes & Noble, according to a spokesperson for the superstore chain. Yarros, interviewed for some 75 minutes by Olympic gymnast and avowed fan Laurie Hernandez, shared a few insights about her writings (she already knows how the series will end), spoke lovingly of her husband (“He’s 6'4\" and hot as hell with a baby strapped to his chest”), swore casually and joked that hers was the “only profession where you can have imaginary fiends” and not be considered insane.  She expressed relief and pleasure over completing “Onyx Storm,” noting she had to block out her own popularity to get the writing done. “As much as I love you guys, I kind of pretend you don’t exist,” she said. “I kind of ignore you, but I love you at the same time.” “Onyx Storm” isn’t quite a Harry Potter-level phenomenon — the final Potter book byJ.K. Rowling, “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” sold more than 8 million copies in the U.S. in its first 24 hours — but it carries a similar feeling of obsession, identification and spontaneity. Like the Potter books, the release of “Onyx Storm” was welcomed with midnight store parties around the country, gatherings for which fans showed up in costume. Some fans at The Town Hall finished the 526-page “Onyx Storm” within hours of receiving it, others are in no hurry. “This is a book I personally want to take my time with,” said Scarlett Fuentes, who arrived with her friend Zy Bao-angan, both of them in black leather. “I want to savor this moment,” Bao-angan said. Like Potter, enthusiasm for the Yarros books extends well beyond any organized publicity campaigns. The Potter books helped inspire some of the first Internet fan sites for books. Yarros and such fellow romantasy authors asSarah J. Maashave been favorites of the young readers on BookTok, a TikTok community that has emerged as publishing’s most effective driver of sales. Countless fans on BookTok and other social media — some crying, some cursing in amazement — have been posting their responses to “Onyx Storm.” On Friday, Hernandez and the audience posed questions about her books as if gossiping about friends. If Violet and Xaden were at a bar, what would they order? Violet would go for a lavender lemon drop, Xaden is fine with a beer. And which music genres define them? Xenon is heavy metal, Violet harder to label. Asked what was the most important lessons she has learned from writing the books, Yarros reminded her fans that she wasn’t only a writer or public figure. “I can say plotting and I can say everything, but probably the most important thing I’ve learned is that real life is what happens in my house, and what happens around my kitchenette and what happens in my living room chairs and what happens when my kids are all together and my husband’s together,” she said. “Real life is not what happens on the internet.” “I love you guys,” she added. “But peace out.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Erin Hooley, file)     CHICAGO (AP) — Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove visited Chicago on Sunday to witness the start of ramped-upimmigration enforcementin the nation’s third-largest citypromised by the Trump administration, though few details of the operation were made public. Bove said he was in Chicago on Sunday morning and observed Department of Homeland Security agents, along with assisting federal agencies — including the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives. He didn’t say where the operations took place in the city or detail any arrests. “We will support everyone at the federal, state, and local levels who joins this critical mission to take back our communities,” Bove said in a statement. “We will use all available tools to address obstruction and other unlawful impediments to our efforts to protect the homeland. Most importantly, we will not rest until the work is done.” U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Jeff Carter said the agency “began conducting enhanced targeted operations” Sunday in Chicago but declined other details, citing an ongoing operation. Spokesmen for the FBI, ATF and the Drug Enforcement Administration confirmed their involvement but didn’t give other information. Chicago residents, especially in immigrant circles,have already been on edgefor months in anticipation of large-scale arrests touted by the Trump administration. The atmosphere has been especially tense the past week as top Trump officialsvowedto start immigration enforcement operations in Chicago the day after Trump’sinaugurationbefore walking back those statements.  Immigrant rights groups havetried to preparewith campaigns for immigrants to know their rights in case of an arrest. City officials have done the same, publishing similar information at public bus and train stations. On Friday, Chicago Public Schools officialsmistakenly believedICE agents had come to a city elementary school and put out statements to that effect before learning the agents were from the Secret Service. Word of immigration agents at a school — which have long been off limits to immigration agents untilTrump ended the policylast week — drew swift criticism from community groups and Gov. JB Pritzker. The Democratic governor, a frequent Trump critic, questioned the aggressive approach of the operations and the chilling effect for others, particularly for law-abiding immigrants who have been in the country for years. “We need to get rid of the violent criminals. But we also need to protect people, at least the residents of Illinois and all across the nation, who are just doing what we hope that immigrants will do,” Pritzker said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Chicago has been one of Trump’s favorite targets. The city has some of the strongest sanctuary protections, which bar cooperation between city police and immigration agents. On Saturday, several Chicago-based immigrant rights groups filed a lawsuit against ICE, seeking an injunction prohibiting certain types of immigration raids in Chicago. “Immigrant communities who have called Chicago their home for decades are scared,” said Antonio Gutierrez from Organized Communities Against Deportation, one of the plaintiffs. “We refuse to live in fear and will fight any attempts to roll back the work we’ve done to keep families together.” Durkin Richer reported from Washington.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)              LAS VEGAS (AP) — PresidentDonald Trumpcame to Las Vegas on Saturday to crow about his campaign promise to eliminate taxes on tips, signaling to allies in Congress the importance of the policy but stopping well short of offering details for making the slogan a reality. Instead, Trump spent most of his 40 minutes speaking to roughly 1,000 supporters in a casino ballroom lauding his November election victory, mocking former President Joe Biden’s administration and touting his torrent of executive actions since taking office Monday. “But I have to be honest with you, I’m really here for a different reason, I’m here to say thank you,” Trump told the crowd at Circa Resort & Casino. The victory lap, Trump’s first swing-state rally since taking office, came after he won Nevada’s six electoral votes in November, becoming the first Republican since George W. Bush in 2004 to carry the state. It was part of Trump’s sweep of all seven of the most competitive states that gave him a healthy electoral majority and a second, non-consecutive term. AP correspondent Julie Walker reports President Trump leans into his pledge to eliminate taxes on tips. Aides said Trump’s stop in Nevada was to deliver an “economic-focused message” built around his familiar promise to hospitality industry workers to remove the tax on gratuity income. “We’re going to get it for you — ‘no tax on tips,’” Trump said, standing behind a podium emblazoned with the same slogan he used throughout the 2024 campaign.  After the rally, Trump strode through the Circa casino floor past its purple-hewed velvet tables, to cheers from visitors of “USA, USA.” At a roulette table, a player yelled, “Give me $47 on 47,” for Trump, now the 47th president. “Ohh,” Trump lamented at the losing throw but he signed autographs as supporters hooted. If light on detail, Trump’s comments on tips were a signal to Republicans in Congress that the proposal is a priority for the massive tax package they intend to pass this year. Trump is set to meet House Republicans on Monday as they gather in Florida to chart the strategy ahead. Speaker Mike Johnson, who is laboring to get the package moving forward, invited Trump to address a joint session of Congress on March 4, a tradition for new presidents, who don’t deliver a State of the Union address until their second year in office. Johnson said lawmakers working with Trump hope to make the next four years “some of the most consequential in our nation’s history.” Nevada is a familiar backdrop to talk tips and taxation. As a candidate, Trump first announced the idea of ending gratuity taxes during a rally in June in Las Vegas — aproposal later copiedby his Democratic opponent,Kamala Harris. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates there are 2.24 million restaurant servers across the country, with tips making up a large percentage of their income. In Las Vegas, the 24-hour economy is fueled by everyone from wait staff and valet parkers to hotel maids and casino dealers, all of whom collect tips. Nevada has the nation’s highest concentration of tipped workers, with about 25.8 waiters and waitresses alone per 1,000 jobs, followed by Hawaii and Florida. Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer for the Culinary Union, which represents about 60,000 hospitality workers across Nevada, said Trump’s plans “must not end” with scrapping taxation on tips. “Eliminating taxes on tips and ending the $2.13 sub-minimum wage — that is the reality in too many states across the country — will uplift millions of hospitality workers,” Pappageorge said. He said many employers set hourly pay well below the federal minimum wage and expect gratuities to make up the difference. Despite the stated focus on taxes, the Nevada rally served mostly as a capstone of sorts to Trump’s first week in office, as he recounted for the crowd the executive orders he’d signed and what they’ll do. “We’ve accomplished more in one week than most administrations have experienced in four years and we’re just getting started,” Trump said, adding that his executive orders “reverse the horrible failures and betrayals that we inherited from a group of people that didn’t know what the hell they were doing.” Trump cited a sweeping freeze on new money for all U.S. foreign assistance, his notice of a U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and his order ceasing diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the federal government, among other things. “We feel a light over our country,” Trump said. ”Everyone does.” Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

        "content": "Hegseth, Noem join Trump's Cabinet after Senate confirmation. President Donald Trump took a victory lap at a Las Vegas casino on Saturday after a five days of issuing executive orders on immigration, the economy, DEI and more. Trump late Friday night stirred up outrage when he blindsided at least 17 inspectors general at multiple federal agencies by firing them in an email from the White House personnel office. Meanwhile, two more of Trump's picks for his Cabinet -- Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense and Kristi Noem as secretary of Homeland Security -- were sworn in to office on Saturday. In a post on X thus morning, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that Belarus “just unilaterally released an innocent American, ANASTASSIA Nuhfer, who was taken under JOE BIDEN!” Rubio credited Trump and Chris Welby Smith, the State Department’s deputy assistant secretary for Eastern Europe, for the release.   Nuhfer was detained in early December 2024 and visited by a consular officer about three weeks ago, a State Department spokesperson said. -ABC News' Shannon Kingston Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, the top Trump appointee in the Justice Department, is currently in Chicago to “personally observe DHS immigration enforcement operations and support the efforts of FBI, DEA, ATF, USMS, and federal prosecutors who are assisting DHS in this critical mission,” a DOJ spokesperson told ABC News. The department declined to provide any additional details about Bove’s precise location or the planned “enforcement operations” he will be overseeing.   His presence on the ground, however, further highlights how the Trump administration plans to involve the highest level officials at DOJ as part of its broader show of force on immigration enforcement. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement said in a statement Sunday that it, \"along with federal partners, including the FBI, ATF, DEA, CBP and the U.S. Marshals Service, began conducting enhanced targeted operations today in Chicago to enforce U.S. immigration law and preserve public safety and national security by keeping potentially dangerous criminal aliens out of our communities.\" -ABC News' Alexander Mallin The Coast Guard said it's helping transport migrants who are in the country illegally and who are in locations where there aren't Defense Department assets. In a Saturday news release, the Coast Guard said it is conducting flights between Texas and California to get migrants to DOD bases to be removed from the country.   \"Border czar\" Tom Homan said the Trump administration isplanning to use military aircraftevery day to help carry out large-scale deportations. For the first time ever, the U.S. government is using military aircraft to transport migrants out of the U.S., Homan said. -ABC News' Luke Barr Kristi Noem was sworn in as secretary of Homeland Security Saturday afternoon. Noem’s oath of office was scheduled around the same time as Trump's Las Vegas rally, and therefore her ceremony was delayed. -ABC News' Kelsey Walsh"

        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "Prosecutors say they won’t charge rocker Marilyn Manson after a years-long investigation into sexual assault and domestic violence allegations LOS ANGELES --Prosecutors said Friday that they will not file charges againstMarilyn Mansonafter a years-long investigation of allegations of sexual assault and domestic violence. Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said the allegations are too old under the law and the evidence is not sufficient to charge the 56-year-old shock rocker whose legal name is Brian Warner. “We have determined that allegations of domestic violence fall outside of the statute of limitations, and we cannot prove charges of sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt,” Hochman said. “We recognize and applaud the courage and resilience of the women who came forward to make reports and share their experiences, and we thank them for their cooperation and patience with the investigation.” Nearly four years after the investigation began, then-District Attorney George Gascón said on Oct. 9 that his office was pursuing new leads that added to the “already extensive” file that authorities had amassed. LA County sheriff’s detectives said early in 2021 that they were investigating Manson for incidents between 2009 and 2011 in West Hollywood, where Manson lived at the time. The probe included a search warrant that was served on his West Hollywood home. The case was initially turned over to prosecutors in September 2021, but the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office requested more evidence-gathering andthe investigation resumed. “We are very pleased that, after a thorough and incredibly lengthy review of all of the actual evidence, the District Attorney has concluded what we knew and expressed from the start — Brian Warner is innocent,” his attorney, Howard King, said in a statement. The identities of the women police and prosecutors spoke to were not revealed, but “Game of Thrones” actor Esmé Bianco — who sued Manson in a case that has been settled — said she was part of the criminal investigation. Before the decision not to prosecute, she criticized how long the process was taking at a rally for Hochman, who was elected soon after. “Almost four years ago, I did what victims of rape are supposed to do: I went to the police,” she said on Oct. 10. “I described to them in agonizing detail how the rock musician Brian Warner — better known by his stage name Marilyn Manson — had raped and abused me over the course of our relationship.” Bianco said she gave investigators “hundreds of pieces of evidence, including photos of my body covered in bites, bruises and knife wounds, emails and text messages, threats to my immigration status.” In her lawsuit, Bianco alleged sexual, physical and emotional abuse, and said that Manson violated human trafficking law by bringing her to California from England for non-existent roles in music videos and movies. “Whilst I am deeply disappointed by the decision of the District Attorney to not bring charges in the case against Brian Warner, I am sadly not surprised,” Bianco said in a statement released by her lawyer. “Once again, our justice system has failed survivors. Not the individual prosecutors and detectives who worked for years on this case, but the system that made them do so with one hand tied behind their collective backs.” In 2021 Manson's former fiancée, “Westworld” actor Evan Rachel Wood, named him as her abuser for the first time in an Instagram post. Wood and Manson’s relationship became public in 2007 when he was 38 and she was 19, and they were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up. “He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years,” Wood said. Manson replied on Instagram that these were “horrible distortions of reality.” He sued Wood, saying she and another woman fabricated accusations against him and convinced others to do the same. A judge threw out significant sections of the suit, then in November, Manson agreed to drop it and pay Wood's attorney fees. The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they’ve been sexually abused, unless they come forward publicly as Bianco and Wood have done. Other women sued Manson in the months after Wood came forward. Wood's representative did not immedately return a message Friday. Manson emerged as a musical star in the mid-1990s, known as much for courting public controversy as for hit songs like “The Beautiful People” and hit album’s like 1996’s “Antichrist Superstar” and 1998’s “Mechanical Animals.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "content": "Conversations about removing these watchdogs began during Trump's transition. In a late-night Friday move, President Donald Trump fired at least 17 independent watchdogs -- known as inspectors general -- at multiple federal agencies, sources familiar with the move told ABC News. The conversations about ousting these government watchdogsbegan during Trump's transitionback to the White House. While inspectors general can be fired by the president — it can only happen after communicating with Congress 30 days in advance and in 2022 Congress strengthened the law requiring administrations to give a detailed reasoning for the firing of an IG. There isn't yet have a complete list of all the IG's impacted, but at least one high-profile watchdog — Justice Department IG Michael Horowitz — did not receive notice that he was fired as of yesterday evening. Horowitz is an Obama appointee and has issued reports that have been critical of both the Trump and Biden administrations. The current law also mandates that any acting IG's must come from within the IG community, though it's unclear whether the Trump White House believes they need to follow that aspect of the law. The inspectors general were blindsided by emails they received Friday night from Sergio Gor, the director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, according to a source with knowledge of the firings. \"I am writing to inform you that due to changing priorities your position ... is terminated, effective immediately,\" read the emails reviewed by ABC News. Many of the IGs had met with Trump transition officials at their agencies and had productive conversations with the incoming administration, the source said. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Saturday that Congress was not given the required 30-day notice. While talking to reporters aboard Air Force One Saturday evening on his way from Las Vegas to Miami, Trump classified the firings as a \"common thing to do.\" \"Well, I did it because it's a very common thing to do – not all of them. Like Horowitz, we're keeping.\" He continued, \"It's a very standard thing to do, very much like the U.S. attorneys.\" \"There may be good reason the IGs were fired. We need to know that if so. I'd like further explanation from President Trump,\" Grassley said in a statement given to ABC News. \"Regardless, the 30 day detailed notice of removal that the law demands was not provided to Congress.\" Grassley told ABC News earlier this week that the president must tell Congress before removal. \"First of all to remind that our Inspector General can't be removed from office until the president, and that's any president, not just Trump. So this is a message to all these presidents you've got to tell Congress a month ahead of time the reasons for removing them,\" Grassley said. He added, \"And the other thing is that inspector generals are expected to be independent of political pressure, independent of the head of the agency, and to make sure that the law is enforced and money spent appropriately, and there shouldn't be any political pressure against any of his work.\" In a letter to the White House Friday, Mike Ware, the Small Business Administration inspector general and chair of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, said the firing of the independent watchdogs over email is not \"legally sufficient to dismiss Presidentially Appointed, Senate confirmed Inspectors General.\" The letter, obtained by ABC News, goes on to explain the removal process codified in the 2022 amendments to the inspectors general law. \"The requirement to provide the substantive rationale, including detailed and case specific reasons, was added to better enable Congress to engage on and respond to a proposed removal of an Inspector General in order to protect the independence of Inspectors General,\" Ware wrote. In floor remarks Saturday morning, Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer ripped into the Trump administration for the move, saying that the dismissals are a possible violation of federal law. \"These firings are Donald Trump's way of telling us he is terrified of accountability and is hostile to facts and to transparency,\" Schumer said. Republican Sen. Joni Ernst launched abipartisan IG caucusjust ten days ago. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the newly-minted group, told ABC News he'll be looking to his Republican colleagues on that panel to take some sort of action. \"We have a group, and it is bipartisan, that is supportive of inspectors general, and I think it is a real test of whether they are willing to let loose an unchecked surge of corruption and waste,\" he said. Reaction among Republican senators was mixed. Texas Sen. John Cornyn deferred to Grassley when asked for comment. \"I think we just take it one step at a time and try to understand what the rationale was,\" he said. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky, said he believes many of the inspectors general do need to be replaced and that Trump ultimately has the power to do so. But he noted there may be a process that needs to be followed. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who helped to pass the legislation in 2022 that strengthened the law requiring administrations to give a detailed reasoning for the firing of an IG, said she was frustrated by Trump's move. \"I don't understand why one would fire individuals whose mission is to root out waste, fraud and abuse,\" Collins said. \"So this leaves a gap in what I know is a priority for President Trump, so I don't understand it.\" Some Republican senators who have been staunch supporters of Trump, however, praised the firings. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said he's \"all for it\" when asked about Trump's move to dismiss the inspectors general. \"We need to clean house. I mean, if they're not for this country to move on down the road,\" he said. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., however, said the firing of the IG's was \"one more example of the lack of respect for the rule of law.\" \"He seems to be trying to throw a monkey wrench into the kind of any independence left in our government,\" Warner said of Trump. \"The whole idea of inspector generals is to have that independent check. Who is going to take those jobs going forward?\" Later Saturday, the ranking Democrats on the House committees sent a letter to Trump strongly condemning the firing of several inspectors general. \"Your actions violate the law, attack our democracy, and undermine the safety of the American people,\" the group wrote. \"Firing inspectors general without due cause is antithetical to good government, undermines the proper stewardship of taxpayer dollars, and degrades the federal government's ability to function effectively and efficiently,\" they added.
